making information available people any time any place and any form Realizing such promise depends innovations areas that impact the creation information services and their communication infrastructures However this realization can easily become mixed blessing without methods filter and control the potentially unlimited flux information from sources their receiving end users Realistic deployment scenarios for information filtering technologies have many differentiating characteristics For example the type information and radio programming live news services electronic mail and the information transport architecture broadcast narrow cast point point are two the characteristics which strongly affect the appropriate choice filtering technology The success many new information services that provide end users with access diverse information sources crucially dependent the availability effective filtering technology This technology can used both the information sources and their end users route and control the delivery information For example the domain entertainment the individual information sources may use filters target material preferred end user groups and individual end users may use filters select the material their choice out all available sources The demand for information filtering technology not new however and not limited new information services Over decade ago Peter Denning ACM President Letter Electronic Junk Commun ACM March focused the implications automatic document preparation systems and electronic mail and the quantity information being received end users pointed out that The visibility personal computers individual workstations and local area networks has focused most the attention generating information the process producing documents and disseminating them now time focus more attention receiving information the process controlling and filtering information that reaches the persons who must use November Bellcore hosted Workshop High Performance Information Filtering Morristown Organized and sponsored Bellcore cooperation with ACM SIGOIS the workshop was the first its kind The even brought together over one hundred researchers from major university and industrial research labs who share strong interest the creation large scale personalized information delivery systems The workshop covered all aspects this emerging area including its relation the established field information retrieval variety methods for filtering architectural concerns high speed filtering systems and variety existing prototype applications well requirements for future applications This special issue features five articles that represent the scope and content that workshop Each article represents different aspect the field and together they form realistic view the workshop addition present four sidebars depicting individual snapshots emerging filtering approach applications Belkin and Croft ask and answer the question Information Filtering and Information Retrieval Two Sides the Same Coin The authors determine that information filtering well defined process examining its foundations and comparing the foundations the enterprise the authors find there very little difference between filtering and retrieval abstract level They conclude that the two enterprises have the same goal namely they are both concerned with getting information people who need However the authors emphasize that research has ignored some aspects the general problem which both and information filtering address and that these aspects are precisely those which sic especially relevant the specific contexts filtering Loeb picks where Belkin and Croft article left off examining some the ways information filtering models may extend models More specifically Loeb article centers Architecting Personalized Delivery Multimedia Information providing both mapping the filtering application and usage scenarios and specific example novel filtering model and its implementation The author provides analysis successful filtering applications the context the personalized multimedia music system Personalized Information Delivery Analysis Information Filtering Methods Foltz and Dumais present results experiment aimed determining the effectiveness four information filtering methods the domain technical reports The experiment was conducted over six month period with users and over new reports published each month Overall the authors conclude that filtering methods show promise for presenting personalized information Using Collaborative Filtering Weave Information Tapestry Goldberg Nichols Oki and Terry describe experimental system that manages coming stream electronic documents including email newswire stories and NetNews articles The system implements novel mechanism for collaborative filtering which users annotate documents before the documents are filtered Because annotations are not available the time new document arrives the system supports continuous queries that examine the entire database documents and take into account newly introduced annotations during the filtering process The Datacycle Architecture Bowen present the operating principles fully implemented platform that supports very high performance information filtering Key realizing the architecture the the fly data filtering operation which supports both expanded information retrieval functionality and conflict resolution for management changes database contents This article complements the others this section describing application independent platform that embeds enough the application semantics adequately meet high performance requirements believe that these five articles together with the sidebars capture the excitement and quality the work reflected the workshop Sidebar topics are Automating the Creation Information Filters Curt Stevens Modeling Users Interests Information Filters Irene Stadnyk and Robert Krass Competitive Agents for Information Filtering Paul Baclace Natural Language Understanding for Information Filtering Systems Ashwin Ram kepart washington edu
