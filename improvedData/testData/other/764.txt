Seattle NYC London Tangier Casablanca Marrakech Two days this exotic but much touristed city were enough rented tiny Renault crossed the high Atlas mountains braved sandstorm the Sahara and arrived week later Fez where spent our final few days Before our trip many travelers had warned the numerous hassles insistent and unwanted offers from would guides who wouldn understand Although saw bit this Marrakech our net experience was far cry from the warnings people were really friendly much more than any country visited before almost every town visited someone invited their house for dinner spend the night The trip engendered many wonderful memories but favorites stem from walking the labyrinthine souks Fez and participating incredible Berber wedding The wedding took place Ait Oudinar small village the end the paved road which follows the Dades river upstream from the rocky desert flatlands been crossing the Sahara for three days when came the Dades oasis astonishing ribbon green fields with almond and walnut trees shading gardens from the searing sun Perched high cliffy knolls were picturesque kasbahs adobe fortresses with thick walls and slitlike windows built centuries ago defend the agricultural wealth from the raids camel bound nomads many are still occupied today The surrounding landscape rugged slopes scarlet rubble provided unreal contrast the verdant irrigated valley floor The gorge walls were painted astonishing range colors salmon saffron carmine and vermilion but the harsh illumination gave the land frightening air Even Margaret diehard sun worshiper mentioned that some clouds might nice addition the cobalt sky gave teenage hitchhiker lift his house the paved road end and liked his happy lucky nature much that later asked him our guide for hike into the hills climbed the vistas grew ever more stupendous but the mountains seemed bleak couldn imagine anyone living them But our guide Mohammed was right and soon came the summer camp family Berber nomads The woman was off tending the sheep but the man invited into their smoke blackened cave sat down fine kilim carpet boiled some water small twig fire and served syrupy sweet mint tea Meanwhile his young daughter and two small sons watched shyly from the deeper recesses the cave Mohammed translated our questions from French Berber and relayed back the responses Every other morning the family gathered water from distant spring using donkey camel transport drums the precious liquid saw the backstrap loom where goat hair was woven into tent fabric for their winter accommodation Sundays they would take few sheep goats the village market far below and trade fresh meat for sugar vegetables and clothing was clearly hard life but one which had been followed for generations After thanking the nomad for his hospitality continued our hike Eventually descended the Dades river and followed downstream narrow gorge Wading through the refreshing water while gazing towering orange walls reminded Escalante Utah During the walk Mohammed had explained that his sister wedding was that night and invited attend Berber weddings occupy three more the case very rich clans days feasting dancing and celebration tonight was day two and the family the groom was host After cleaning from our hike drove our Renault Mohammed parents house where half the town had assembled the street The women were especially well dressed with vibrantly colored robes gaudy amber necklaces bright yellow scarfs dangling with beads and small silver squares hands freshly henna The crowd was tense and expectant chatting excitedly group started singing and drumming Finally the door opened and Mohammed father emerged followed his daughter adorned bright red and fully veiled While veils are common the towns and cities women rarely wear them the more practical rural areas Cheering the crowd surged for the road Mohammed ran for our Renault packed seven people including his mother inside the tiny vehicle set the hazards flashing the gathering dusk pressed hard the horn and eased thru the procession wellwishers oozing traffic jam that slowly rolled thru the streets towards monumental party which was assembling the groom house Both lanes the road teemed with the parade cars bikes donkeys and pedestrians Each truck had dozen youths clinging the outside Under Mohammed eager hand our horn blared jaunty tune which was adopted the other vehicles Infectious excitement washed the caravan churned slowly towards the groom house While never actually went inside later the evening were able watch hour dancing from the side jam packed courtyard which served the dance floor dozen men lined facing similar row women and they swayed and turned time drums and chanting beat honest the dancing was bit anticlimatic after the day other experiences but maybe things heated later the program didn end until long after left other incredible memory was the medieval city Fez dating from The buildings were fascinating gurgling fountains with bright tile mosaics ancient green roofed mosques steamy Moorish baths exquisite medersa Koranic schools with finely sculpted plaster ceilings and elaborate lathed cedar latticework Encased huge defensive ramparts the old city appears have swelled the walls and then buckled under the pressure centuries vibrant life The narrow alleys twisted and turned bewildering confusion Crude bamboo mats hanging from above blunted the sun create murky dappled shade that accentuates the exotic locale Tiny booths and workshops lined the crowded winding streets because guilds each specialty clustered together Cobblers tinsmiths and other artisans sat the floor their small shops practicing their traditional methods amid display work progress Coppersmiths crafted huge shiny kettles for village feasts Jewelers tapped delicate geometric patterns silver plates pair burly blacksmiths prodded the glowing charcoal their fiery furnace removed red hot iron shaft and alternated hammerblows until cooled One could smell the tannery from distance but once inside the courtyard the stench intensified disgustingly The whitewashed yard was honeycombed with fetid vats and stupified workers stood thigh deep the filthy pools hauling the dripping goat hides from one trough another The shadowy looms the weavers district exuded more tranquil atmosphere the hushed clatter wooden shuttle hurling across the warp scarcely broke the silence Nearby slipper shops were piled high with stacks shoes nested one inside the other inside wrinkled men stitched thick leather soles supple tops with long needles and tough fingers the dyer souk men with soot blackened faces lifted skeins yarn from steaming vats dye and wrung out the excess pigment before hoisting the colorful wool sun dry rainbow display Far from the lane cabinet makers found cluster alcoves where carpenters crafted spindles bellows couscous sifters and other small items Small shops sold pottery with elaborate designs glazed traditional Fez blue Other shops held smoothly polished carvings sandalwood lemonwood fragrant cedar Still others displayed silk scarves brocade and Koranic quotes embroidered azure squares velvet lush gold thread One alley was packed with butchers white tiled alcoves illuminated with naked incandescent bulb and fenced with hunks red meat hanging from hooks Nearby country women sold vegetables squatting blue tarps piled high with produce Some shops specialized olives counted over dozen varieties one stand Figs dates sweet pastries nougat and fresh fruit were plentiful The aroma the spice market was intriguing and the pharmacist sold dried hedgehogs live terrapins mineral shampoo black Berber cosmetics henna candles and prayer beads Each night dusk the streets flooded with tide people Crowds eddied about charcoal braziers sizzling with fresh kabobs and roasted corn Veiled women dragged children through alleys surging with crowds and Margaret and were separated several times the unpredictable current There seemed only one rule the roads and that was the urgent cry Balak balak which warned approaching donkey heavily laden with firewood perhaps with fresh hides dripping from the tannery was important language lesson and one learned quickly While the overwhelming variety exotic sights and smells were fascinating came realize that Fez true magic was time travel The walled city provided glimpse back the medieval ages era unchanging craftsmanship and simple practical technologies passed from father son for generations Alas our time
