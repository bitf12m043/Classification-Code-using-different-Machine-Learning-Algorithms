LazowskaDepartment Computer Science EngineeringUniversity WashingtonThe University Washington one the nation premier research universities For more than twenty years has ranked among the top five institutions annual Federal research obligations Currently second Johns Hopkins with MIT and Stanford third and fourth positions Currently ranks fifth industrial research support The faculty includes ninety members the National Academies seven MacArthur Foundation award winners and four Nobel prize winners the past decade Fifty seven junior faculty have won NSF Presidential Young Investigator Awards number programs are ranked among the top dozen the nation their fields including Atmospheric Sciences Bioengineering Biostatistics Cell Developmental Biology Computer Science Engineering Dentistry Geography Neurosciences Nursing Oceanography Pharmacology Physiology Psychology Public Health Community Medicine Sociology Statistics and Zoology What does this mean the State Washington and its citizens students parents and taxpayers some cases the answer well known preeminence the medical sciences for example has given Medic One kidney dialysis some the finest health care the nation and flourishing bioengineering and biotechnology industries featuring companies such Immunex Ostex PhysioControl and Zymogenetics This document tells the story from the perspective another field information technology focusing the Department Computer Science Engineering and touching related programs the mathematical sciences and engineering Half Century Exponential Progress Information Technology Who What When Where Why and How There has been mind boggling progress information technology which pervades most aspects our lives and most aspects our economy The nation that leads information technology enjoys enormous competitive advantages America owns this leadership today thanks complex interplay between government academia and industry Industry can afford look ahead only few years The high risk fundamental research workforce mobility difficulty capitalizing internal innovations and shareholder behavior are among the reasons nation though can and must invest for the long term America future depends upon our broad based leadership certain key sectors not the individual success failure specific companies and large this work takes place universities with government support The historical track record clear over the course many decades federally supported university research has played critical role essentially every aspect information technology timesharing computer networking workstations computer graphics database technology Very Large Scale Integrated VLSI circuit design Reduced Instruction Set Computer RISC architectures subsystems based upon Redundant Arrays Inexpensive Disks RAID parallel computing and others Universities transfer technology two ways They transfer ideas licensing and placing concepts the public domain And they transfer people students and faculty leave join form companies Close industry university interactions facilitate this technology transfer well facilitating the exchange insights about long term strategic directions this pattern innovation and technology transfer the fluid interaction between academia and industry that has made America the world leader information technology and that will help maintain this critical lead The unique genius America university system that combines research and education ideas and people And not just graduate education The single most important factor shaping own career was adoption undergraduate Brown University Professor Andries van Dam took his course became his teaching assistant became his research assistant became his protege and friend And not alone Three other faculty members department were Andy undergraduate students The computer science department chairs MIT Maryland Princeton and Waterloo addition were Andy undergraduate students The person who wrote much the early software for the Macintosh Apple and the person who oversaw the architecture family Intel and the person who ran the Windows project Microsoft and now heads Internet activities there were Andy undergraduate students That the kind program run the University Washington forefront research and seamless integration research with education very special kind education that takes bright students and brings them the very forefront critical not take one dimensional view Don try measure impact single measure companies created technologies licensed dollars raised programs out ranked students graduated And don try view Washington higher education system monolithically for system with different institutions serving different purposes for different students and different employers You can get your arms around this with spreadsheet For further information see the Computing Research Association web based monograph Computing Research Driving Information Technology and

and How http www washington edu homes lazowska faculty lecture plus their associated links The University Washington RoleThe University Washington very special institution There nothing else like entire quadrant the nation north California and west Illinois research major industry brings far more money each year than the state budget the institution million during fiscal compared state appropriation less than million Strong programs attract top flight people the Northwest both students and faculty These programs provide first rate education Washington residents The University Washington Department Computer Science Engineering ranked among the top ten programs the nation both for the quality its graduate research programs and for the quality its undergraduate programs CSE faculty member David Salesin teaches computer graphics undergraduates state the art instructional laboratory equipped with equipment donated Silicon Graphics Inc response Salesin research contributions and curricular innovations Undergraduates who excel this course become Salesin teaching assistants and research assistants Salesin most recent research publications Spring were authored with undergraduates Salesin has just finished teaching course computer animation multi disciplinary teams undergraduates drawn from Art Music and Computer Science Engineering second state the art instructional laboratory equipped with equipment donated Silicon Graphics Inc response proposal from Salesin Art Professor Shawn Brixey and Music Professor Richard Karpen Professional animators Ronen Barzel from Pixar and Annabella Serra from Rainsound taught the course augmented guest lecturers from the animation industry This the kind education that the University Washington strives provide the University Washington research and education are inextricably linked research relationships equip instructional laboratories research infuses the curriculum research creates and funds opportunities for independent study the cutting edge research builds ties leadership companies that provide and internship and ultimately permanent employment opportunities graduates form the next generation Washington leaders business engineering science and government These graduates staff high technology industry The University Washington the largest supplier new college graduates the nation Microsoft The University Washington also the largest supplier new college graduates the nation Intel Intel has Strategic Universities and The Department Computer Science Engineering essentially the only supplier number major regional firms such DECwest Engineering Geoworks Seattle and Tera Computer Every year CSE sends more than outstanding Computer Science and Computer Engineering majors into the Puget Sound area workforce Programs such CSE import new technology the Northwest CSE brought the Internet the Northwest years ago when DECsystem our department became the first computer several state region attached what was then ARPANET Today University Washington Computing Communications operates the attachment point for NorthWestNet the principal Internet service provider the Pacific Northwest about the same time the original Very Large Scale Integrated VLSI circuit designers the Northwest were trained CSE program sponsored CSE Boeing and Caltech Graduates that first course built the first microprocessor VAX the MicroVAX DECwest Engineering These programs create new technology the the Pascal compiler for Digital Equipment Corporation then new VAX computer was built CSE the existence this compiler given significant credit for the VAX rapid penetration the academic market WebCrawler one the first search engines for the World Wide Web was designed implemented and deployed CSE graduate student Brian Pinkerton WebCrawler was sold America Online Sundodger Scout football scouting program offering breakthroughs flexibility and visualization was conceived and implemented two CSE graduate students working with the University Washington football department Sundodger Scout credited the Husky coaches with contributing considerably the team remarkable success Pac champion coming off two years probation Collaborative research computer graphics between the University Washington and Microsoft has led new products and new technologies incorporated existing products the SIGGRAPH conference papers the total presented this premier international conference were from and Microsoft from from Microsoft and joint CSE computer systems technology for application performance tuning
