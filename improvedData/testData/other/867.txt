natural numbers something says the closure part that every element the set has obtained through finite number applications the operation How can set infinite every element obtained from one element finite number applications operation that element Sam Answer The beauty inductive recursive definition that infinite set objects can defined from purely finite description algorithm Each object the infinite set well founded that built from some basis objects using just finite number applications the inductive rules Why are there infinite number objects given such definitions Basically because there are infinite number different ways that objects can constructed from the basis objects the simple example there only one basis object lambda new member can constructed concatenating member the right already existing member then can obtain the infinite set lambda aaa aaaa such process cse Subject Correction book Date Mon Jan PST From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu pointed

Subject Student Question Date Thu Jan PST From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu Question Does anyone know what asking for That just doesn make any sense Also does anyone have good way check and see your regular expressions are correct Thanks Sam Answers There are two questions Take for example the equation lambda union lambda One solution but another for example union That the set equation may have more than one solution this case the solution subset all other solutions Your problem explain why this the case more generally How you check that regular expression correct This can generally quite hard This method does not guarantee correctness but may find errors Give your expression friend several friends they find error then simply give counterexample that either string not covered the expression string which the regular language covered the expression but not the language Date Thu Jan PST From Trent Piepho xyzzy washington edu cse washington edu Subject Student Question

turn the derivation tree only also the line line derivation You can either turn the line line derivation the derivation tree Your choice partial the tree since saves hands from too much writing takes several rules derive expression letter Since have this for can just put next the child arrow that points the end result once has been previously derived Shouldn there also some note the star reading something like steps thru this would require labeling the relavent child arrows the tree What you suggest Any well documented shorthand fine long you have gone through some version the derivation single letter variable least once and your shorthand very clear iii example there sub derivation identifier letter identifier tail identifier tail the Pascal lang spec dont see anything like identifier tail Did miss Instead see identifier letter letter digit want only one write identifier letter letter digit letter since take mean zero more reps can just write identifier letter What the proper way terminate identifier Maybe your response will also answer this want derive from unsigned integer write unsigned integer digit digit digit Sorry for such long message Good observation Grammars BNF are slightly different than context free grammars have defined them since they include the bracket notation stuff which means concatenate stuff more times The intro appendix discusses this issue One thing you should convince yourself that BNF grammars can easily converted our CFGs For example the homework replace the following BNF productions with their CFG equivalents BNF unsigned integer digit digit CFG unsigned integer digit digit digits digits digit digits lambda BNF identifier letter letter digit CFG identifier letter identifier tail identifier tail letter digit identifier tail lambda where lambda the empty string You can use these CFG productions instead the BNF ones answer problem Hope this helps Date Mon Jan PST From James Fix fix dandelion washington edu cse

Subject Why context free Date Tue Feb PST From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu Question Can you explain what the context free part context free language means can figure out what context refering Answer the early days grammar research there was interest other kinds grammars For example you could imagine production the form CDE That you see the string sentential form then you can make derivation step that replaces the with CDE Context free grammar not allow these kinds productions The context refers there being more than one symbol match when doing derivation step cse

Washington campus Date Thu Feb PST From James Fix fix dandelion washington edu cse dandelion washington edu Subject reminder about DFAs Just reminder about the definition DFAs When you are constructing your DFAs for remember that delta function Sigma and must fully defined This means that for every state there should exactly one transition from that state for every character page the book gives example DFA where the transition function not complete but then converts fully specified DFA adding error state You may need the same for some the DFAs the homework Once again the general rule For DFA every state must have one outgoing arrow for every character the alphabet Date Thu Feb PST From James Fix fix dandelion washington edu sliqyboy sliqyboy netcom com maiohmai washington edu cse dandelion washington edu Subject DFA equivalence question DFA accepts the language described regular expression possible for the DFA also accept strings that are not described that regular expresssion corollary you had generate DFA that accepts the language described regular expression you also have ensure that the DFA rejects strings that are not the language described the regular expression Yes that right when you are determining whether DFA accepts exactly the language described regular expression you need ensure two things that the DFA accepts the strings the language described the regular expression that the DFA rejects the strings not the language described the regular expression Equivalently you can show the following every string accepted the DFA the language described the regular expression every string the language described the regular expression accepted the DFA Note that these are just ways showing that the two languages are equal real easy find DFA that satisfies only one these two conditions the DFA that accepts every string the alphabet trivially will accept any string language described regular expression but accepts other strings well This same reasoning explains why the behavioral lemma problem homework and only show that the construction from correct need say that accepts exactly Date Fri Feb PST From James Fix fix dandelion washington edu cse dandelion washington edu Subject corrections clarification problem the text should read Think the set arbitrary shuffles strings from and For example aab and then the strings aabbb ababb bbabb and many other strings are Also you should notice from the example that the definition the and are strings not characters That why the language contains shuffles strings and rather than just interleavings Date Mon Feb PST From James Fix fix dandelion washington edu cse dandelion washington edu Subject question about behavioral lemmas Forwarded message Date Mon Feb PST From James Fix fix dandelion washington edu Jason Murray jmur grizzly washington edu Subject question about behavioral lemmas Regarding Friday lecture Ladner was talking today about how could not use not prime and not out behavioral lemma for the last homework still not clear why this confusion comes from the example did class involving suffixes was able use not and not prime his behavioral lemma One reason you might not want refer specific states behavioral lemma due the application the induction hypothesis prove the lemma For example the reversal problem what you most likely wanted for behavioral lemma was something that said that processing was similar some way processing Something like for all lambda iff lambda The inductive step for this would involve looking this lambda for some state and invoking the induction hypothesis say that lambda you instead fix and and state the this way for all lambda iff lambda Then you get trouble because even though lambda for some you cannot conclude that from your induction hypothesis because your inductive hypothesis says nothing about general just too specific The reasons for how much you want specify generalize your are somewhat analagous the reasons for choosing strong weak induction general more powerful and potentially more useful but may not necessary general more powerful because says something about more things You may need prove the more general version get clean inductive proof Often more general nicer because says lot about your construction more specific fine long you can actually prove without having prove the general the process you can actually use prove the overall theorem that you trying prove the suffix example class only the specific was necessary and more general was not obvious Hope this explanation wasn too general Date Mon Feb PST From James Fix fix dandelion washington edu Jason Murray jmur grizzly washington edu cse dandelion washington edu Subject More corrections clarifications case you weren sure problem should read prove this contradiction from first principles question Since bbabb string aaa also string oops bbabb aaa are not necessarily given only that aab and are See below for the correction Another can see how the third the three examples bbabb can constructed from aab and missing something you absoultely right The question should read For example aab and then the strings aabbb ababb bbaab and many other strings are Sorry did not catch this bbabb not necessarily element since the number and differs from the number and aab and combined The reason bbaab that the and the set expression can lambdas one way getting the string bbaab fit the set pattern let lambda aab lambda this way get lambda aab lambda bbaab and aab and Just make this more clear ababb because let lambda get lambda ababb and aab and Sorry for missing these before correct them the web cse Subject Homework problem Date Thu Mar PST From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu Instead building

thought bottom parsing was but incorrect right Both top down and bottom parsing are not deterministic right you did mention parsing method that was deterministic something about look ahead should review Answer The parsing methods described top down and bottom are nondeterministic However the grammar has the right properties then one both methods can made deterministic make them deterministic may require lookahead and the creation many states did mention class that the bottom parsing method more generally used because can handle more context free languages than the top down method and the grammars handles tend nicer mentioned several times that there are context free languages which are inherently nondeterministic Every PDA accepting such language nondeterministic What did not mention that there parsing method that never used practice which can parse any context free grammar This parsing method takes time and not practical cool method though Richard cse Subject Final Exams and
