Programming Guide Addison Wesley Publishing Company The examples will probably not run unless you are running Mosaic locally Silicon Graphics workstation Accumulation buffer anti aliasing example Run accanti View accanti Same scene accanti without anti aliasing Run accnot View accnot Same accanti but anti aliasing with perspective example Run accpersp View accpersp Yet another accumulation buffer anti aliasing example Run accum View accum Calculates the field view the direction Run aim View aim Simple alpha blending example Run alpha View alpha Alpha blending example Run alpha View alpha Anti aliased true color RGBA lines example Run anti View anti Anti aliased color index lines example Run antiindex View antiindex Anti aliased points color index mode Run antipindex View antipindex Anti aliased points RGBA mode Run antipoint View antipoint Anti aliased polygons Reality Engines only example Run antipoly View antipoly Simple bezier curve example Run bezcurve View bezcurve Bezier surface example Run bezmesh View bezmesh Wire frame version bezmesh example Run bezsurf View bezsurf Texture maps checkerboard onto two rectangles example Run checker View checker Texture maps repeated checkerboard onto two rectanges Run checker View checker Same checker but only repeats edge pixels not whole pattern Run chess View chess Arbitrary clipping planes example Run clip View clip Diffuse material example Run colormat View colormat cone Run cone View cone stretched wireframe cube with perspective Run cube View cube One dimensional NURBS curve Run curve View curve Fog used make distant lines darker Run depthcue View depthcue Quadrics used draw some disks Run disk View disk Accumulation buffer used make distant objects blurry example Run dof View dof Same scene dof but without blur Run dofnot View dofnot Double buffering rotating square example Run double View double Draw bitmaps using glBitmap example Run drawf View drawf Feedback buffer queues primatives and then prints them stdout example Run feedback View feedback Teapots the fog example Run fog View fog Fog color index mode example Run fogindex View fogindex Draws text bitmapped font using glBitmap and display lists example Run font View font Demonstrates lighting model Run light View light Display lists are used draw lines with different stipples Run linelist View linelist Diffent types stippled lines example Run lines View lines Executes display list draw triangles example Run list View list Demonstrates glGenList and glPushAttrib Run list View list Lighting color map mode Run maplight View maplight Assortment different materials shown example Run material View material Mipmaps used draw texture map with different color for each bitmap size example Run mipmap View mipmap Demonstrates modeling transformations example Run model View model Light source moves around object example Run movelight View movelight NURBS Non uniform rational splines surface shaped like heart Run nurbs View nurbs Mouse and depth buffer are used select objects example Run pickdepth View pickdepth Mouse used select lines Run pickline View pickline Mouse used select square Run picksquare View picksquare Demonstrates directional versus point lights Run plane View plane Composite modeling transformations used drawing models arrow keys move spheres Run planet View planet Like planet but scene oriented Run planetup View planetup Demonstrates polygon stippling example Run polys View polys Arrow keys move wire frame arm example Run robot View robot Color light source Run sccolorlight View sccolorlight Same scene sccolorlight but without colored light Run scene View scene Same scene sccolorlight but with blue ambient light Run scenebamb View scenebamb Same scene sccolorlight but with flat shading Run sceneflat View sceneflat Shows selection mode and name stack detect wheter objects collide with viewing volume example Run select View select White rectangle black background example Run simple View simple Gouraud shaded triangle example Run smooth View smooth Wire frame sphere using glTranslatef Run sphere View sphere Diamond stencil cuts out part scene example Run stencil View stencil Demonstrates stroke vector font and display lists example Run stroke View stroke Nurbs surface symmetrical hill example Run surface View surface One versus two sided lighting Run tea View tea Teapots with different ambient values Run teaambient View teaambient Several different materials shown teapots Run teapots View teapots Texture mapped teapot with texture coordinates generated automatically example Run texgen View texgen Evaluators used generate curved surface and texture corrdinates example Run texturesurf View texturesurf BROKEN Curves trim away part NURBS surface example Run trim View trim Like font but draws fonts Run xfont View xfont sean washington edu last modified Tue Sep
