photo The University Washington Founded the University Washington has students undergraduate and graduate professional and faculty teaching and research divided into schools and colleges The University annual operating budget roughly billion which comes from the State The University Washington one the nation premier research universities For more than twenty years has ranked among the top five institutions annual Federal research obligations Currently data the most recent available second behind Johns Hopkins with MIT and Stanford third and fourth positions Currently ranks fifth industrial research support The faculty includes eighty six members the National Academies eight MacArthur Foundation award winners and four Nobel prize winners the past decade Fifty seven junior faculty have won NSF Presidential Young Investigator Awards number programs are ranked among the top dozen their fields including Atmospheric Sciences Bioengineering Cell and Developmental Biology Computer Science Engineering Dentistry Ecology Evolution Behavior Geography Microbiology Neurosciences Nursing Oceanography Pharmacology Physiology Psychology Public Health Community Medicine Sociology Statistics Biostatistics and Zoology The home page includes official profile photographic tour and pictorial history Steam Powered Turing Machine Computer Science Engineering Mural Photo Judy Watson The Department Computer Science Engineering The Department Computer Science Engineering was established inter college graduate program undergraduate program Computer Science was added and departmental status was conferred second undergraduate program Computer Engineering was added when the department moved the College Engineering The department currently has roughly faculty members staff members graduate students and undergraduate students The department ranked among the top ten the nation Fifteen CSE faculty members have won Presidential NSF Young Investigator Awards one the highest totals nationally regardless discipline and more than the University Washington total this prestigious award Three faculty members are ONR Young Investigator Award recipients two hold Presidential Faculty Fellow Awards and one holds Sloan Research Fellowship Among the senior faculty are seven Fulbright recipients two Guggenheim recipients nine Fellows the ACM and six Fellows the IEEE Within the University three faculty members have received the College Engineering Faculty Achievement Award two have received the University Washington Distinguished Teaching Award and one the first member the College Engineering named the University Washington Annual Faculty Lecturer Dick Karp the latest addition our faculty brings with from him Berkeley host honors including the Turing Award and membership both National Academies his first year the University Washington Karp was awarded the National Medal Science strive maintain highly effective graduate program two strong undergraduate programs and open culture with minimal partitioning either vertically between faculty ranks between faculty and students horizontally between research areas Suzzallo Library University Washington photo Research Overview are active most the principal areas computer science and computer engineering Particular strengths include VLSI Embedded Systems and CAD Gaetano Borriello Carl Ebeling Ted Kehl and Larry Snyder Computer Architecture Jean Loup Baer Susan Eggers Hank Levy Larry Snyder and Arun Somani Operating Systems Networks and Communication Brian Bershad Lazowska Hank Levy Alan Shaw and John Zahorjan Programming Systems Alan Borning Craig Chambers Susan Eggers and Larry Snyder Software Engineering Safety and Human Computer Interaction Nancy Leveson David Notkin and Alan

Computation Richard Anderson Paul Beame Anna Karlin Dick Karp Richard Ladner Larry Ruzzo Martin Tompa and Paul Young Computational Biology Dick Karp Larry Ruzzo and Martin Tompa close collaboration with adjunct faculty Phil Green Leroy Hood and Maynard Olson There are many research activities that cut across these areas for example parallel computing well number strong external interactions Olympic Coast Sunset Olympic National Park Washington Photo Dan Weld The Graduate Program The department has roughly students and Masters students the full time graduate program typically graduate students and Masters students each year offer admission between and those who apply our graduate program Eight our students received NSF Graduate Fellowships the competition Our recent graduates have received offers from essentially every top academic department and industrial research laboratory and dozens our recent graduates populate these strong programs Five recent graduates have received Presidential NSF Young Investigator Awards two have received Presidential Faculty Fellow Awards and one has received Sloan Research Fellowship Two graduates have been recognized the ACM Distinguished Dissertation Award competition Autumn introduced accessible Masters program involving mix distance learning and evening courses designed for fully employed professionals the region burgeoning information technology industry This program will ultimately enroll roughly students Allen Library University Washington photo The Undergraduate Program The department has two undergraduate programs Computer Science degree program graduating students per year and ABET accredited Computer Engineering degree program graduating students per year Students are admitted our majors competitive basis upon completion prerequisite courses result our undergraduates are strong classes are small and interaction with the faculty high The average overall freshman sophomore GPA among students enrolling the Computer Science program for Autumn was roughly among students enrolling the Computer Engineering program was roughly Junior and senior classes typically have enrollments less than Undergraduate participation research common Because Washington State has the nation fastest growing software industry there currently are nearly firms more than two thirds our graduates remain state the course their education roughly two thirds our undergraduates participate which feel enhances the effectiveness undergraduate engineering education Winter Sunset Rainier Rainier National Park Photo Dan Weld The Puget Sound Region The Puget Sound region increasingly prominent national and international technology center Key strengths the University Washington include medicine biotechnology the physical sciences and computing and allied areas science and engineering Many the central players digital convergence are headquartered here such McCaw now Wireless Geoworks Microsoft Nintendo America and Teledesic The region home many other companies critical broad competitiveness Boeing The Space Needle Space Needle photo the nation fastest growing software industry even independent Microsoft significant players bioengineering and electronics etc There major activity high performance computing Tera Computer Company the Department Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory well rapidly growing biotechnology industry Leroy Hood NSF Science Technology Center plus number companies that either preceded were attracted created the STC There burgeoning digital content industry too Strong collaborations exist among these groups and the Department Computer Science Engineering seeks play major role the University and the region Integration the key view research education outreach and impact seamlessly interconnected For examples see The Impact Research University Information Technology Perspective Our annual Affiliates Meeting forum for interaction among more than leadership companies from the region and the nation Our UWTV televised colloquium series and professional Masters program play significant roles keeping the region leading edge workforce current Seattle consistently acclaimed one the most livable cities the nation terrific place Seattle cosmopolitan city situated the midst the beauty and diversity the Pacific Northwest The University Washington located Lake Washington few miles east Puget Sound The Cascade Mountains are one hour the east the Olympic Peninsula and Olympic Mountains are two hours the west This document http www washington edu
