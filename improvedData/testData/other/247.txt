February TIME PLACE Sieg Hall HOST Dick Karp SPEAKER Pavel Pevzner University Southern California TITLE Genome Rearrangements What Dobzhansky and Sturtevant Did Not Tell ABSTRACT Sequence comparison computational molecular biology powerful tool for deriving evolutionary functional relationships between genes However classical alignment algorithms handle only local mutations insertions deletions and substitutions one nucleotide and ignore global rearrangements inversions and transpositions long fragments result the applications sequence alignment analyze highly rearranged genomes herpes viruses plant mitochondrial DNA are very limited address the problem GENOME comparison versus classical GENE comparison and present algorithms analyse rearrangements genomes evolving inversions transpositions and translocations the simplest form the problem corresponds sorting reversals sorting array using reversals arbitrary fragments present polynomial algorithms and duality theorems for sorting reversals and genomic distance problem also discuss applications the proposed techniques analyze evolution herpes viruses plant mitochondrial DNA and mammalian chromosomes This joint work with

itinerary you could suggest people groups who may interested Spliced Alignment New and Naive Approach Gene Recognition Previous attempts solve gene recognition problem were based statistics and artificial intelligence and surprisingly enough applications theoretical computer science methods for gene recognition were almost unexplored Recent advances large scale cDNA sequencing open way towards new combinatorial approach gene recognition describe spliced alignment algorithm and software tool which explores all possible exon assemblies polynomial time and finds the multi exon structure with the best fit related protein Unlike other existing methods the algorithm successfully performs exons assemblies even the case short exons exons with unusual codon usage also report correct assemblies for genes with more than exons provided homologous protein already known test sample human genes with known mammalian relatives the average overlap between the predicted and the actual genes was which remarkably well compared other existing methods that the algorithm absolutely correctly reconstructed genes The rare discrepancies between the predicted and real exon intron structues were restricted either extremely short initial terminal exons less than amino acids proved results alternative splicing Moreover the algorithm performs reasonably well with non vertebrate and even prokaryote targets The main result the paper that relatively simple algorithm based combinatorial common sense and some biological intuition can outperform many approaches developed for gene recognition the last fifteen years This joint work with Gelfand and Mironov For more information elizabeth egan center for molecular biotechnology NSF Science Technology Center university washington

interesting suggestions for course projects please send them CLASSIFICATION PROSTATE CANCER TUMORS This project related research Lee Hood laboratory the classification prostate cancer tumors believed that disease category such prostate cancer ovarian cancer includes number distinct disease types that may require very different kinds medical treatment Some prostate cancers develop slowly that they present threat mortality while others require immediate medical intervention The existing diagnostic tests not distinguish the different variants the disease Molecular biology may provide new experimental techniques that will distinguish the different types prostate cancer ovarian cancer now possible extract the mRNA from tumor and transcribe back cDNA hybridizing the mix cDNAs from tumor against large number genes from normal tissue and measuring the amounts hybridization product produced one obtains profile the gene expression taking place the tumor Experiments are now getting under way which will use this hybridization technique obtain measurements gene expression each prostate cancer tumors and data will available late March These experiments will provide much more detailed fingerprints tumors than has been available now The computational challenge use this large body data classify the tumors into clusters and based this classification determine rules that can used classify tumors the future One special feature the problem the high dimensionality the data the large number measurements for each tumor likely that only small subset these measurements will important for the clasification but cannot know advance which ones these will The project will consist looking into the literature clustering and classification discover appropriate computational methods and software packages well devising special methods suited this particular problem Since real data will not available the end the quarter may desirable test out different methods simulated data MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT There are few different ideas for projects concerned with multiple sequence alignment introduced Lecture and Homework The general issues explore are the various methods valuation alignments sum pairs consensus Steiner phylogenetic tree and efficient algorithms for achieving good alignments under any these valuation schemes Because one knows efficient algorithms for optimal alignments under any these valuation schemes the project could explore ideas for heuristics approximation algorithms Dick Karp has divide and conquer heuristic that would interested sharing There minimum spanning tree heuristic hinted problem Homework and more details what done practice are available Gusfield manuscript and other sources Exploring such heuristics could done experimentally analytically Data for experimentation might come from exisiting databases containing multiple aligned sequences could generated synthetically cDNA MATCHING Another project explore introduced problem

research interests include computational biosequence analysis machine learning statistics and information theory you would interested meeting with Haussler please let know Abstract With the databases DNA RNA and protein sequences growing explosive rate the need for effective computational methods for biosequence analysis has become acute particular need good methods for locating genes DNA sequences along with their splice sites and regulatory binding sites and good methods for making initial classification new proteins that detect weak homologies other previously known proteins and predict possible functions for new proteins Tools available for this analysis range from simple and general search methods such BLAST detailed protein folding models the type used protein threading and initio protein structure prediction Hidden Markov Models HMMs lie somewhere the middle this spectrum They are computationally efficient enough for use with large databases yet flexible enough used constructing specific detailed statistical models the sequence variation within particular protein family our within family related DNA binding sites will describe what HMMs are and how they are used
