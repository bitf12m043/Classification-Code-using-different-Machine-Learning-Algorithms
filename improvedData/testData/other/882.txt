should satisfied for example that line remain horizontal that resistor electrical circuit simulation obey Ohm Law that the height bar bar chart proportional some number application program Constraints have been used variety languages and systems particularly user interface toolkits planning and scheduling and simulation Our research several areas constraint imperative programming particular the Kaleidoscope language constraint logic programming particular the HCLP language scheme constraint hierarchies constraint solvers using constraints user interface construction People Faculty Alan

ftp directory ftp washington edu pub constraints The code subdirectory contains source code for various constraint solvers and systems including DeltaBlue and SkyBlue All this code public domain The ppcp subdirectory contains papers from the Principles and Practice Constraint Programming Workshop There papers subdirectory with research papers but all the papers are also listed this WWW document don bother Finally there drafts subdirectory which sometimes contains preliminary drafts papers For more general information constraints and links lots interesting stuff see the Constraints Archive
