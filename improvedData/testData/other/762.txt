Klein words the phone did Could this happening Could this actually real Realizing the odds but unable hold back vision new life Loving each other never been happier After two months helping Margaret through bedrest fearing premature delivery the expected induction was almost surreal But when they broke Margaret waters and she was launched into the rapids labor the tempest was pretty shocking watch Contractions were back back with time rest recuperate Fortunately Margaret dilated quickly and after mere two agonizing hours her pleas for epidural were granted Now heard from multiple sources that this form pain relief had almost magical power fact one friend had such gratitude for her anesthesiologist man named Hans that she would have bestowed the name her child she hadn gotten daughter Before helping Margaret through labor thought this story apocryphal but now know better her anesthesiologist hadn been woman imagine that Margaret might have argued switch our choices well The delivery itself was amazing Adam and Galen entered the world just minutes apart witnessed about fourteen doctors and nurses did what could but even without Margaret had full squad cheerleaders Good thing too just couldn keep straight face while saying What good pushes but Tanya and the nurses sounded sincere When Adam emerged Mom birthday was small and helpless impossible describe his first tiny cry Galen almost swam out riding the water slide his breaking amniotic sac Tanya couldn jump back and got soaked happy for the videotape because all happened fast The next two weeks were frustrating had planned take uninterrupted time off from work but given that the boys had stay Swedish hospital there was little for made more sense for work could take time off when they came home But course wanted visit night schedule revolved around the bus trip Swedish and brief chance feed and change them tiny amount contact for hours travel hospital time each day but the contact was amazing gather that many couples have emotional homecoming with their child The homecoming was emotional for too but the particular flavor was panic took the two boys from Swedish Childrens where dropped Margaret and Adam then took Galen home alone soon pulled out the Children parking lot Galen started cry the time got him inside was screaming And was alone Margaret nurses new age man fact thought was pretty good diapers and bottles but that was the hospital routine had that wired But here home nothing was its place couldn find the diapers The breast milk was the trunk the car There were bottles found nor any nipples The wailing grew louder Finally found the diapers and removing the soiled one preparation its replacement gave Galen the opportunity sought pingo pee all over Dad Once Adam came home from Childrens Hospital finally had our family Spending days with the boys home fulfilled many dreams but the nights were another matter The sleep deprivation didn bother not until reserves wore out month later but Margaret did She started acting weird night put the boys down nestled together the cradle across the room and then climb into bed ourselves Later woken from barely begun sleep hear the cries and wonder Margaret would get feed them had agreed whether should and try comfort them futile endeavor given anatomy Although the cries were escalating Margaret wasn moving couldn she hear them felt guilty that Margaret had full responsibility for feeding even though had agreed this plan felt hesitant wake her But finally nudged think Galen hungry suggested quietly That why feeding him she responded got angry What over the cradle screaming And she woke was sure was here bed nursing what vivid dream subsequent nights had variations Dan Don you think you should feed Adam Margaret That could complicated Dan incredulous Complicated Margaret Because all the babies here bed All she dreamed were breasts suckling and rivers flowing with milk Some nights would bottle feed the boys not much relief for Margaret since she then had pump but they often ate more and hence slept longer after bottle feed And even when Margaret breast fed would get help change diapers and burp them always hard climb from the warm sleepy covers into the cold chill the bedroom But the sight Adam Galen gently stretching and slowly waking wondrous that delight quickly overwhelms selfish annoyance joy watch them wuffling heads back and forth search Margaret breast And once they both latch they stare wide eyed watching each other competitively sucking Galen particular fun watch gets frantically hungry that often has difficulty realizing that the breast right THERE his mouth But when gets latched has tremendous vacuum Last night realized why his sucking sounded familiar was the same rhythmic noise the gasoline pump the service station Chug chug CHING Chug chug CHING Over Thanksgiving Margaret sister Anne and her husband Jona brought their newborn Oliver Seattle Only one month older but boy big And what eater Apparently keeps asking his mother Please madam could have bit more that milk with some milk sauce Unbelievable read cartoons about how new parents actually got excited about pop and drool but when came home from the departmental Christmas party Margaret was bursting tell about her evening alone with the boys Galen had this really MASSIVE poop she exulted The boy Bris Lots heavy feelings and concerns especially the hours right before the event But don wish write about Instead let rejoyce the fact that they are fine And recount the funniest incident Part way through the rabbi figured that the mohel was probably ready with the preparations the nursery and going get the boys discovered that there was five minutes kill Delaying the rabbi asks kids attendence there are any questions Silence Then Una says What bris Very good question says the rabbi and answers with long philosphical discussion the ritual history and significance Then since there was still need for delaying tactics asked again Any other questions Casey chirps Are the bow and arrows REAL Margaret and always used remind each other that crucial treat life process not goals and objectives The boys make this ever more clear incredible how fast they are growing seven weeks they are almost double their birth weight Focusing and tracking Loving held Hands gaining control Smiling The ultimate process What night came home late after hard day which started early The AAAI deadline only days away and things are heating But felt bad missing whole day the boy lives The bike ride home rejuvenated and once arrived was delightful just hold and calm first Galen then Adam Margaret had already cooked delicious meal Felt relaxing But the simple pleasure coaxing Galen sleep chest was nothing compared what was follow While ate dinner the kitchen the boys were their car seats beside Adam was calmer now and waving his hands like conductor Suddenly noticed that was watching intently dropped knees and crawled over beside him His eyes are locked mine shape grin and suddenly matches Huge exaggeration Eyes incredibly wide Amazing Such spasms feeling goes and His body writhes with happiness seizure will never forget Eventually became much and overstimulated started cry The binky solved the problem and min later was ready again smiled him his eyes opened wide Head wiggled and fussed tried figure out what Then the smile broke out WOW really seems like momentous occasion wonder what going his head some level more incredible than learning use one hands This the first real communication with another being for him until now all been one way cry for help but tonight was two way connection had thought that had social smiles before this but they have been paltry affairs compared tonight They were gratifying but just not the same significance The AAAI deadline finally past papers express mailed yesterday five and got managed spend last evening and this morning actually watching and playing with the boys How much they changed the past week Adam seems perceive the world completely different manner than the last time really spent time with him really tracks objects eyes shift from Mom Dad and back when both are proximity incredible learning phenomenon just can imagine how much going inside his head how figuring out Originally the stream visual information had structure but now can recognize human faces There must some incredibly strong bias which directs the process both magical and inspiring also incredibly fun Both Adam and Galen are giving lots smiles now Melts heart couple nights ago came home from work midnight all tense and absorbed with technical and political issues The bike ride thru crisp air cleared mind and set the stage but when saw the boys remembered how unimportant research the grand scheme things The boys are groing fast that simply must take day off week witness the process The boys are gaining control all their muscles and naturally their mouths come first Their feeding behavior very different from the tentative and uncoordinated initial efforts Now they know what they want and are quite expert getting times they exude calm competence the pursuit their food and reminds cowboys herding their cattle Margaret nipple was steer the boy mouth would lasso The capture movement giant facial lunge much like the leap into saddle Adam and Galen are breast cowboys Hawaii Big Island tried taking the boys for their first swim the ocean and the frightening wailing which ensued suggests that they didn fully like controlled Adam water landing holding him mock standing position and gently lowering him towards the black sand which was periodically washed thin sheet water When his feet first touched cold wave Adam little legs retracted next his body knees splayed sideways like the wheels airplane that refused the touchdown However the ocean experience has caused notice how Galen just bit resembles wet flopping fish when gets angry and frustrated too hungry eat all stiff neck whipping around arms flailing Like sad and panicking grouper out water Nathan bouncy chair has been revelation When first put Adam his eyes expanded saucer like The brightly colored toy bar fixed his eyes and his arms started their weird spasmic gyrations The toys are easy grasp and rewardingly pivoted the bar that the slightest knock produces gratifying jiggle spin One can almost see the reinforcement learning work Indeed quite amazing how dramatically his behavior has grown just two days now hits with much higher reliability both hands and frequently contects solidly enough spin the toys for loop think controlled grasping may but week away How satisfying will for them able put things their mouth whenever they want the meantime they are dedicated students the combination complete concentration with helplessly incompetent movements incredibly endearing matter how many times happens can seem get used the sudden surprise when one the boys has oral eruption The ensuing river fresh spitup soaks shorts and races down leg with shocking warmth feels strangely was peeing pants don like but somehow akin forbidden act illicit pleasure Once past the shock yield the experience and smile Our week Hawaii with David Felecia and their baby Nathan was wonderful but the trip has lead new avoidance behavior for Margaret now that are back home Seattle Last night when she woke the wee hours the sound small hungry wimpers she simply nestled deep the covers ignoring the cries After all she told herself just Nathan crying not one boys surprising landmark Adam exhibited purposeful grasping this morning His look intense concentration would have inspired the ape suited actors from the beginning Space Odyssey their discovery fire Indeed could almost hear the ghostly sound Strauss Also Sprach Zarathustra playing the background Meanwhile Galen remains stuck the excited batting stage When managed trick him into holding the Squish then flailed his arm such way knock himself the head the routine checkup today Margaret asked our Pediatrician why babies drool apparently Science has yet solve this mystery but the doctor did explain that the more talkative ones drool most copiously Indeed the squawking Adam who soaks his clothes and drenches ours with the precious substance Inspired this soggy state Margaret considering applying her epidemiological skills prospective study correlating drooling infancy with verbal performance during higher education Perhaps this will lead the ultimate early predictor college admissions the Salivatory Aptitude Test Chip birthday coming just week after our boy four month birthday emphasizes many things The Yin and Yang life and death The transitory nature many life joys The danger taking people and pleasures for granted just can imagine how the death Adam Galen would hit How terrifying just returned from week Utah camping the desert canyon country with the boys day scrambled across slickrock pushed between sandstone needles and explored dark joint caves babies tucked securedly snugglies night Adam and Galen slept quietly their own sleeping bags either side Sometimes when woke forgot that was father the owl call across the quiet night the bright stars the smell wilderness seemed natural like many camping experiences the past Then hear slight stirring side and realize sons were here too Incredible Utah was the first chance for Nathaniel and William ages and meet their cousins was touched their obvious love for the babies and their excited interest playing with and singing them also noted the sibling rivalry that Nathaniel and William displayed hiked during the day The age difference affects the relationship strongly William copying and competing his role model Nathaniel needing occasional time away from the cloying dependence With age difference Adam and Galen will have very different relationship The opportunity for companionship great but the danger competition commensurate wonder how will develop After camping Canyonlands faced the tortuous drive back the Salt Lake City airport way could the boys that long between feeds but didn feel comfortable driving with them out their carseats And stopped for nursing that might make the trip longer Finally limber wife arrived solution Climbing into the back seat our Pathfinder she arched her back leaned over Galen and managed initiate breast feeding while was safely the car seat The rear mirror view was quite hilarious secret confession last night was the last bed entered the dark and silent bedroom bent down the bassinets and sniffed boys The moon had set and couldn see their faces the shadow but felt soft breathing cheek Slowly sampled the air and savored the smell sons this every night today shower for Oren and Ruth the soon parents asked for advice from all attendance One woman observed that everyone would imposing suggestions and noted that they should feel free adapt ignore anything that didn seem right This set thinking about all the half right advice been given over the ages For example Douglas Adams his famous book The Hitchhiker Guide the Galaxy observes that the most important object the common beach towel which should carried everywhere adapt this one refer spare diaper And the NRA warns agains walking around with loaded gun not set safety could lethal interpretation after feeding always thump the baby back until you hear the positive sound the burb engaging safety just irresponsible walk around with loaded and cocked baby even the potential danger tad less terminal During our weekly lunch David shared his pride that Nathan has started crawling Then that evening David calls chagrined Someone has punctured his pride explaining that true crawling requires the belly elevated from the floor apparently Nathan has only been scooting The fine points the distinction are lost boys can barely lift their heads off the floor when trapped their bellies but touched the degree which David honesty tempering his bragging just didn want you get the wrong idea about his accomplishments David concluded the call Whether one calls crawling scooting the drawbacks the approaching milestones begin sink Recently David and Felicia awoke midnight the sound crying Apparently Nathan had rolled over his sleep scooted several feet the side his crib risen high hands and knees and woke himself bashing his head against the crib bars And clearly hard lesson for Nathan learn the ramifications his new found power Yesterday when played together the floor Nathan was interested solely scooting But didn quite understand what was doing With each deliberate movement Nathan backed farther and farther away from the rest the group the distance separating him from David grew Nathan grew ever more frantic His face screwed into increasingy worried frown but couldn grasp that his actions were responsible for the parting Ruth delivered her baby boy last night Watching anxious Oren these last few weeks brought back memories from the end Margaret pregnancy How could have forgotten the tense expectancy the slowly approaching event Like Oren remembered being worried about whether would ready physically support wife during labor dragged for hours more Somehow never doubted that she could handle her part And although Oren never mentioned could see that was scared that might not love his baby comes back now although seems hard believe had that fear too But how could not love them How fast time passes and how quickly forget Today Adam and Galen six month birthday They seem small but they are different from Oren and Ruth son Eli seems impossible that our boys were ever inert compliant delicate newborn Eli Although rational mind recollects that Adam and Galen together weighed less than Eli does now seems impossible Springtime magnificent Seattle signaled exuberant procession daffodils tulips cherry blossoms and dogwoods But even more than the flowers springtime for symbolized the nesting shorebirds with their promise fuzzy yellow chicks month ago spotted well concealed nest tended two Canada geese built mostly reeds and grass the nest perched tiny island the middle stream entering Lake Washington Since bicycle commute takes along the stream been able watch the nest carefully each morning and afternoon For over month empathized with the parents dedication egg warming would pedal towards the nest with anticipation and feel comforted see the nest always well tended Unfortunately yesterday brought torrential rains Garbed Goretex hunkered down for the ride work but when reached the stream everything looked different The nest island was swallowed flood and there was sign either bird The scene struck profoundly emotional level and couldn stop thinking about all day Although the rain had subsided the stream was still choked with muddy water and could discern nothing from the bank felt suprisingly depressed despite spotting the first chicks the season not far from the stream The gander hissed approached his gangly offspring and kept distance not daring hope that this was the family had been watching long This morning the waters receded left bike and pushed through wet brush find fallen log which crossed the brook Balancing carefully above the swampy flow approached the ruined nest Four large grey eggs lay half submerged the chill water one side soggy pile straw Abandoned couldn quite believe that the depressing sight was real and all could was think back the many times when thought and desperately hoped that Margaret was pregnant only confronted depressing truth The years trying and later months bedrest were difficult but how lucky our final result Regaining bike wondered what the geese were thinking how much they understood Did they morn wished the birds well Stuffed and heading towards Scotland fear impending nine day separation from the boys Even more than their own growth the inexorable passage the past week with commensurate and growing dread came symbolize time momentum hate being deprived from week their lives wonder how they change while gone and whether they remember when return Since last writen this journal Adam and Galen have changed enormously month ago when placed them their bellies strengthen their necks they hated much that referred the exercise Tummy Torture But now they like Although neither one yet crawling Galen wriggles all around and frequently rolls from back tummy seach toy induced oral gratification wonder could begin scooting crawling while Scotland With the arrival summer weather our neighborhood has come alive While was the incredible abundance children thirteen the fourteen families have two more kids which attracted the deadend block the first place only this year are really integrating into the community Afternoons and weekends see dozens kids playing the streets with parents trading off informal chaparone duty Whenever anyone spots appoaching auto the warning Car raised and repeated all the kids reminds the way tail slapping resonates across beaver pond the first hint danger The sense community rains from the rhythms the children kids stream out one house and flow into the next interconnected swirl different games With the addition Adam and Galen the flow extends our house well rainy afternoon will usually bring knock and Julia Jessica Kate will ask Excuse but are the boys available for holding extraordinary convenience having the extra helping hands but more importantly great way get know new people Until recently most friends were exactly age with the exception few older couples but now getting know some teenagers sad parents live far away but our block the next best thing extended family Indeed the interactions between the neighborhood kids tell much about ourselves The other night relaxed the Grant yard across the street the eldest daughter Laura left for sleepover love you Mom she called out farewell love you Dad Then afterthought she turned her younger sister and said Bye Julia you While the incident was amusing the time has come symbolize challenge marriage Recently Margaret left for work the morning she first kissed Adam goodbye professing her love Then she kissed Galen telling him how much she would miss him She was halfway the door when Aren you forgetting someone stopped her her tracks and both burst out laughing During the nine days was Scotland boys changed much Fortunately nightmare that they would both forget and learn crawl was ill founded entered the front door after hours exhausting travel could hear them fussing and crying depite Margaret best efforts placation But one look approaching face and they grew happy and excited Arms reached out held dream come true Their faces were subtly changed their heft noticeably heavier but they smelled the same And hadn missed the transition crawling However Adam had learned sit What change this imposes life Now Adam perfectly happy simply sit front big box toys carefully select one grab pull loose from the tangle chew shake throw one side and repeat with different choice Amazing Naturally when take the boys outside they get considerable attention from passersby The usual refrain goes how cute Are they twins Two boys Are they identical How old are they and have the stock answers hard wired One day took the boys nearby Greenlake which circled paved trail and packed with individuals and families walking running cycling and rollerblading clockwise and counter both alone and with pets dogs cats parrots and ferrets crowded zoo and crazy circus quickly became apparent that twins were quite common here and happily were largely ignored the rank and file course still felt need share statistics with other parents multiples but this learned could quite efficient One man approached jogging top speed with loaded double stroller and the five seconds between first sighting and perigee blurted out Twin fraternal girls two years and barely managed respond Twin fraternal boys seven months before vanished the distance Such efficiency the past week boys made amazing realization they could put food into their own mouths Imagine the sequence revelations from how wonderful feels drink milk when hungry the discovery that there exist other foods besides milk stewed prunes and pureed green beans the recent blockbuster that they could feed themselves Chunks pasta slices toast wafers apple and slivers banana all make their way slowly imperfectly but deliberately into their mouths Well actually most ends someplace else face clothes chair floor but bit makes into their mouths Their excitement with the process tangible longer are they content fed they demand active role dinnertime Just sitting them highchairs calms their fussy complaints for while but soon they start banging their hands their tables until they are presented with Cheerios Baby Biscotti our name for Zweiback toast Since they are just learning feed themselves spoon feed them the bulk their meals Galen will eat most anything but Adam has developed quite particular tastes When offered bite Brown Cow yogurt his mouth opens wide but vegetables yield very different expression Adam other recent achievement crawling His first steps were two weeks ago when Nathan was visiting were sitting the kitchen floor playing with toys and Nathan was ambling around the dining room When David called Nathan zoomed into the kitchen crawling incredibly fast Adam stared intently and grew agitated Nathan whizzed past him Suddenly Adam leaned forward and took his first steps crawling two feet was very exciting and gurgled with self satisfaction took while for Adam repeat the achievement but slowly his proficiency has grown For the first week couldn crawl very far because preferred stretch out reaching for his objective and this inevitably left him flopped out his belly position from which could not recover grew fascinated with the manner which his motions evolved day day trial and error Over period week intent exploration led him the discovery mechanically stable way transition from sitting crawling and back always remember his look triumph when first spotted toy successfully retrieved and returned sit and play with Now has mastered the lift from belly crawl maneuver and spending hours rising unsteadily into toe tip crouch and perfecting his balance settling securely back onto his knees only when the ground threatens claim him Since parent house not childproof fortunate that doesn realized that can easily crawl dozen feet Anything farther than three still appears unattainable and fails motivate But repeatedly moving desirable object coffee mug beer bottle newspaper away approaches can spur him athletic heights Naturally Adam ability crawl provides him considerable advantage over Galen the sibling rivalry arms race Not long does Galen get keep the choice toys Adam wheels into position grabs the object before Galen even recognizes the threat and confidently crawls safe distance play keep waiting for Adam prowess spur Galen development but his behavior appears stuck evolutionary trap Long ago realized that stretching his legs way out front could use the tripod principle stabilize the sitting position Actually not sure whether solved the physics equations analytically reached this understanding via brilliant intuitive leap any case the legs now prevent him from crawling towards toy keeps trying and trying valiantly leaning forward and slapping the ground But matter how hard struggles the toys don get closer Galen still isn crawling but has learned spin around and around the hardwood floor very funny watch this lazy susan routine and its interesting ponder why Adam never rotated like top when Galen finds amusing also interesting how the behavior equalizes the sibling rivalry arms race Now when Adam stalks search prize toy Galen simply spins keeping his back towards his predatory brother Adam keeps trying the end run but Galen can spin faster than Adam can crawl Galen finally started moving last week While still isn doing symmetrical crawl lunges forward with both hands then uses his left foot scooch his flacid right leg underneath his bum and repeats can move surprisingly fast Galen new mobility combined with Adam ability climb stairs and pull into standing position makes for huge potential disaster Fortunately the boys like stay together move one into the bedroom change diaper say the other quickly appears They don really play together any meaningful way but they make eye contact frequently and burst out giggling Melts heart month and half have passed but Galen still doesn crawl the traditional sense lopes like injured soldier half tamed animal Indeed his odd gait earned him the nickname Monkey Boy Meanwhile tiny Adam crawls feverish pace Since often carries small toys his mouth looks like puppy When catches sight some forbidden object the distance his short little legs pump high frequency shaking his round baby bum and recedes into the distance The past month has also changed the dynamics the twins toy possession arms race Although Adam still has stronger grip and can force toy from his brother grasp Galen seems now have the advantage His secret meticulous defense When Galen senses Adam predatory pursuit spins degrees and lopes away Adam rarely gets close enough overpower his sibling When the situation reversed however clueless Adam appears oblivious the impending threat his approaching brother Galen simply sidles and snatches then spins and scrams Peach Apricot Muesli sure sounds good But the boys know better Somehow they sense the spoon contents before ever makes near their mouths Adam shakes his head clamps lips shut and flails his arms usually successful attempt deflect incoming mouthfuls Galen can sometimes tricked into bite but then pause the mouth opens tongue rolls back and the complete spoon contents slowly and inexorably forced back out The masticated mess rolls down the chin and impacts the bib How can whole year have passed This should happy day and indeed the boys are happy although they have idea all this fanfare about them but makes sad reminds too undeniably that time ever faster torrent When was child morning could last soooo long remember watching Apollo and Dad saying that would take three days for the astronauts get the moon Three days Sure being the first person walk the moon would cool but three days was way too much sacrifice the rivers time flow ever faster towards the great fall then boys must still floating placid eddy But when look them they don seem placid They revel life experiencing the most dramatic ranges emotion Why that seem less able enjoy life the older get the river banks start moving fast that become transfixed unable focus the journey pleasures for fear reaching the final destination Today observation sons are musical instruments and family orchestra Yes true Galen loves played percussion lies his back like feet straight the air supported lap Sensing the performance about begin hums Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and start rhythmically pumping his legs thumping his belly tapping his chest and vibrating him into sound smiles and changes pitch When our efforts merge brilliant harmony becomes amazed his output and laughs which really sounds funny causing more laughter Meanwhile Adam his back Mom lap resonating away play together side side the kitchen floor The family orchestra Over time Adam and Galen have grown love baths The mere sound tub running water draws Adam from the most distant room the house hadn thought that Galen felt strongly but this morning learned otherwise Assuming Margaret and Adam were seconds behind carried Galen upstairs and left him playing the beroom whil jumped the shower Seconds later was standing against the side the tub batting the shower curtain sang him rinsed shampoo Then heard meaty thud and felt something wriggle against ankles still don know how managed climb over and fall When Margaret and Adam finally arrived they were surprised see Galen peering thru the steam fully dressed sopping wet and very happy shed clothes and cleaned together The boys are fascinated with the concepts and out Adam will spend hours the kitchen floor placing bowls first one the other and then vice versa All the time has his tongue protruding concentration Both love open and close doors With its swinging springy action the kitchen door best They will crawl one room circle behind the door then push shut There moment tension when rests closed especially the boys are separated Drumming fingers lures the hidden boys close the door Then pull the door open and peer around giggles Once prop the door open the new side Adam and Galen race for the chance push closed again Adam has his projects have idea how decides what focus but when sets his mind something becomes completely pig headed Don even think interrupting him unless you are willing brave total tantrum what does Well few nights ago was obsessed with the arch formed between the piano two right legs crawled and over through the arch then turned around and went back Again And again Grunting with effort Tongue out concentration The next day was the green ball ctach grab toss onto the stoop leading towards the bedroom stairs then climb onto the stoop throw off climb off and repeat Over and over Today was the toy box emptied the red crate toys mostly then climb inside Then climb out Sounds easy but the box walls are pretty high was real challenge And any challenge worth savoring Again and again
