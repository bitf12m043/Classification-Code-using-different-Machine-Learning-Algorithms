Engineering University Washington and Chair Government Affairs Committee Computing Research Association House Representatives Committee Science Subcommittee Basic Research Hearing the High Performance Computing and Communications Program October Chairman and members the Subcommittee thank you for the opportunity testify the subject the High Performance Computing and Communications program name Lazowska head the Department Computer Science Engineering the University Washington was member the recent National Research Council committee examine the status the HPCC Initiative about which Ivan Sutherland has testified also serve the Board Directors the Computing Research Association Today here represent the members the Computing Research Association nearly industrial research laboratories and academic programs computer science and computer engineering where the nation cutting edge research and graduate education these fields takes place The Computing Research Association strongly endorses the key findings the NRC study which were discussed Ivan Sutherland his testimony recap There has been mind boggling progress information technology which pervades most aspects our lives and most aspects our economy The nation that leads information technology enjoys enormous competitive advantages America owns this leadership today thanks complex interplay between government academia and industry The record crystal clear The government role also crystal clear Industry can afford look ahead only few years but nation can and must invest for the long term and large this work takes place universities with government support The HPCC program major success The emphasis high performance appropriate cutting edge information technology window the future time machine The emphasis parallel computing success while there much more done its viability clear and many important problems all areas science and engineering have been tackled The inter agency coordination and cooperation working extremely well The Computing Research Association believes that continued authorization the HPCC program elements that continued funding these critical research areas and continued strengthening the inter agency process essential the nation Here why The HPCC program the nation research and education program information technology HPCC the coordinated multi agency initiative that supports nearly all our nation fundamental research and graduate education information technology HPCC much more than the supercomputer centers although the supercomputer centers are multi dimensional and make wide variety contributions science and engineering from astrophysics zoology and including computer science and engineering HPCC much more than the highest performance systems although the highest performance systems are indeed time machines offering window onto the future and although the path from cutting edge desktop direct and rapid HPCC systems software networking human resources and the technology and applications for the nation information infrastructure Information technology our nation future The HPCC program our nation research and education program information technology HPCC inter agency coordination has been model success maximize the likelihood success risky endeavors requires multiple agencies with multiple approaches These agencies can and should coordinated They can and shouldn tightly managed There are lots specific examples successful coordination HPCC the supercomputer centers the gigabit testbeds the digital library initiative the Strategic Implementation Plan the National Science and Technology Council Committee Information and Communications And beyond these and other specific examples agencies such NSF and ARPA have fundamentally different and complementary styles that have stood good stead The HPCC program has proven appropriately flexible and adaptable Fundamental research its very nature unpredictable When Lewis and Clark were exploring America geographical frontier they had strategic objective But things didn always turn out exactly planned there were false starts and changes direction and emphasis with HPCC explore America technological frontier The name has stayed the same but the program has evolved and adapted the focus software has increased dramatically the focus communications has increased dramatically the entire Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications component was added the program with its increased emphasis research issues related horizontal scale that ubiquity addition vertical scale performance HPCC has proven its ability adapt strategic plan for the future exists Though much done much remains The National Science and Technology Council Committee Information and Communications chaired Anita Jones who has just testified last spring produced Strategic Implementation Plan The plan identified six Strategic Focus Areas global scale information infrastructure technologies high performance scalable systems high confidence systems virtual environments user centered interfaces and tools human resources and education Within these areas are critical core topics such software for both computation and communication infrastructure topics such middleware support broad classes information infrastructure applications and applications from the domains many federal agencies the real technology drivers and paradigm shift agents Applications such computational prototyping complete design and prototyping computer leading reduced design time and increased quality The Computing Research Association strongly endorses the CIC Strategic Planning effort and the directions that has identified The role universities and the federal government critical The historical track record clear over the course many decades federally supported university research has played critical role essentially every aspect information technology timesharing computer networking workstations computer graphics database technology Very Large Scale Integrated circuit design Reduced Instruction Set Computer architectures subsystems based upon Redundant Arrays Inexpensive Disks parallel computing and others serve the person Technical Advisory Board for Microsoft Over the past five years Microsoft discovered that order create new markets needed new technologies areas such data compression encryption networking computer graphics operating systems statistical decision theory and forth demonstrated the Brooks Sutherland report without America research universities these and other technologies would not available spur our world leadership Universities look the future The HPCC program has been huge success allowing them see the future through the time machine phenomenon important emphasize that the university research carried out under the HPCC program avoids picking winners and losers The purpose publicly funded research high technology fields advance knowledge and create new opportunities that industry can exploit the medium and long term not determine how the market should develop Universities transfer technology two ways They transfer ideas granting patent licenses and placing concepts the public domain They transfer people students and faculty leave join form companies Close industry university interactions facilitate this technology transfer well the exchange insights about long term strategic directions this pattern innovation and technology transfer the fluid interaction between academia and industry that has made America the world leader information technology and that will help maintain this critical lead Summary Chairman the Computing Research Association believes that continued authorization the HPCC program elements that continued funding these critical research areas and continued strengthening the inter agency process essential the nation believe that the authorization should flexible its approach focused fundamental research broad range strategic areas and allowing adaptation new research targets opportunity appear The research areas described the CIC Strategic Plan provide excellent framework need increase the focus software for HPCC both the computation and the communication side And need keep mind that applications are important research drivers and paradigm shifters applications such those covered the Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications component the HPCC program and the User Centered Interfaces and Tools component the CIC Strategic Plan understand the extraordinary constraints under which this Subcommittee working The Federal investment information technology research though has been incredibly small compared the payoff Thank you for this opportunity testify Back Computing Research Driving Information Technology and the Information Industry Forward http cra org research impact
