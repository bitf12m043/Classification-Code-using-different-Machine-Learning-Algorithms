Innovation Vice President GoreUniversity Pennsylvania Philadelphia February This week delivering three speeches about America technology challenges Monday Baltimore spoke collection scientists and asked What the role science American society Yesterday Virginia asked How must update our notions self government bring them into harmony with the Information Age And today Valentines Day here the glorious Penn campus will complete this technology trilogy and ask How spark the innovation that creates jobs builds businesses and lifts lives answer that question draw time worn technique your most annoying professors answer this question with another question Here How did this happen Vice President displays Valentine card Now don laugh going give this wife Tipper when get back Washington But special for another reason too Later this morning will walk across campus the Moore Building and turn the key the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer the ENIAC the world first programmable computer which celebrating its birthday That computer which stood ten feet tall stretched feet wide and tipped the scales tons contains about much computing power Valentine Day card You know that powerful parallel computer that playing chess against Gary Kasparov about blocks from here can evaluate chess moves the same time took ENIAC add two numbers Anybody here have laptop computer Your computer has more power than the combined power all the computers the world years ago again the question How did this happen How did the power that once spanned entire room migrate this tiny card you can buy for few dollars the stationery store There are several answers The most important one perhaps that got lot smart people this country lot people like the ones who graduated from Penn They sweated long nights the laboratory repeating experiments testing assumptions collecting data and eventually they opened breathtaking avenues possibility And these software writers and computer engineers joined with the marketers and financiers create real products that have made difference people lives Together this duo propelled ideas out the basement computer lab and into the living rooms and offices America But there another explanation for this extraordinary development this explosion computing power and its migration all corners our life explanation that may surprise you explanation not even computer science professors comprehend explanation some you might never have heard before Bruce Springsteen Remember that song Dancin the Dark There are lines that song that contain part the answer the puzzle this card The lines like this You can start fire You can start fire without spark key explanation for this Valentine Day Card for cool wristwatch for your red hot laptops that the federal government provided the initial spark that eventually flickered into these extraordinary products Back the federal government provided small amount money some Penn best engineers they could develop electronic machine that could perform rather narrow task calculating firing tables for artillery weapons That was the birth the ENIAC After the ENIAC was built was put use performing millions discrete calculations that were part top secret research the hydrogen bomb The ENIAC did that well but before long the war ended the time there were some people who thought that the ENIAC and other computers could used for other things maybe even for business The chairman IBM Thomas Watson gushed think there world market for maybe five computers Popular Mechanics issue dedicated the inexorable march scientific progress made ever bolder prediction Computers the future the magazine said may weigh more than tons And went Talented people gradually improved what the ENIAC began Computers got smaller faster smarter And slowly but surely fifty years later can display this card campus where group undergraduates have etched the ENIAC instructions tiny sliver silicon the early days the ENIAC nobody knew where would all lead But these pioneers and this nation were committed idea that transcended any single destination knowledge matters for its own sake pursuing knowledge something that America must They heard the music even they didn know the lyrics You can start fire You can start fire without spark similar tale with the Internet Look the cover this week Time Magazine The Golden Geeks They invent They start companies And the stock market has made them instanaires Now the Internet instanaires got where they are mainly through talent and tenacity But unlikely they could have set the world ablaze had government not provided the initial spark the federal government through the Defense Department Advanced Research Project Agency created something called ARPANET The Pentagon goal was develop computer network that would allow military scientists and engineers share expensive computers and network that could withstand nuclear attack mail was quirky but eventually useful afterthought Over the next decade computer scientists universities and federal labs began connecting the ARPANET few thousand more people began using this new tool but the larger population remained unknown Then the National Science Foundation again agency the federal government began what was called the NSFNET expand the ARPANET include not simply computer nerds but all researchers American universities That led the National Research and Education Network NREN which helped get off the ground And that eventually led the Internet the organic network networks that today bursting with new users creating entirely new industries and reshaping how work and how communicate The ARPANET creators could not have predicted what would happen their brainchild But always they heard the music and now all know the lyrics You can start fire You can start fire without spark One more example Time poster boy Marc Andreesen top official Netscape years old worth about million dollars Not bad That roughly for every day been alive Marc got his start just few years ago part the team that developed Mosaic the first sophisticated browser for the World Wide Web and the breakthrough application that made the Web accessible ordinary computer users Marc performed his work Mosaic the National Center for Supercomputing Applications the University Illinois supercomputing center funded yes the National Science Foundation And the funding for Mosaic itself came from the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative federal research and development program helped pass into law while was Senator course had idea the time that this investment would lead hundreds thousands home pages everything from smashing atoms the Smashing Pumpkins from Albert Einstein Jennifer Aniston Nobody had any idea this investment would uncork amazing fizz shirt riches stories But that wasn the point The point sure you understanding now was this You can start fire You can start fire without spark That how has worked America Government has supplied the initial flicker and individuals and companies have provided the creativity and innovation that kindled that spark into blaze progress and productivity that the envy the world For much this century Americans have benefited from this process this virtuous circle science and success the nation generated wealth portion that wealth was invested research science and technology Those investments helped solve tough problems and eventually spawned still greater wealth which was then invested still more research and went Prosperity generated investment investment generated answers and answers generated further prosperity But now there are some Washington who seem intent snuffing out this spark with the largest cuts science and technology and education generation their most recent budget the Congressional leadership proposed reducing federal funding for science and technology one third the year adjusted for inflation And get this several years after the Cold War ended defense going while civilian going down More for Star Wars less for environmental research the very moment global economic competition and global environmental degradation demand civilian research and the technologies often produces this Congress proposing the sharpest cuts nondefense research since America was fighting World War The only investment the Congress wants increase was health sciences And that great But almost every other realm they approaching technology with all the wisdom potted plant This crowd talks like George Jetson But they support policies more appropriate for Fred Flintstone They promise boldly where Congress has gone before But their flight plan will take straight into the ground They sing tunes about moving America into sunny future But really they just dancing the dark can better than that can invest new technologies not suffocate the fires creativity crazy quilt misguided savings can invest education technology and link our schools the information superhighway not pull the plug our classrooms and disconnect them from the world can invest student loans open the doors college all our young people not shut the university gates all but America wealthiest families That what President Clinton has been fighting for Because understands that the ENIAC changed not only how send valentines but how think about our world For years much our thinking was shaped the metaphor the factory Our elementary schools were built according the principles the assembly line Government approach the economy was tinker shift gears step the gas And most our businesses pursued the same Holy Grail cranking out more and more the same thing lower and lower costs But the ENIAC and the revolution ignited altered that changed our world and demanded new vocabulary describe Yet years after the change began still standing the floorboards Industrial Age metaphors that are creaking with age groaning under the weight new reality think there better metaphor sturdier metaphor more appropriate our times the metaphor distributed intelligence the beginning the mainframe computer era computers relied almost totally huge central processing units surrounded large fields memory The CPU would send out the field memory for raw information that needed processed bring back the center the work and then distribute the answer back into the field memory This technique performed certain tasks well especially those that benefited from rigid hierarchy that depended the outer reaches only for rote tasks Then along came new architecture called massive parallelism This broke the processing power into lots tiny processors that were then distributed throughout the field memory When problem was presented all the processors would begin working simultaneously each performing its small part the task and sending its portion the answer collated with the rest the work that was going turns out that for most problems this approach the distributed intelligence approach more effective But somehow this metaphor and the idea contains never migrated into our public conversation our common vocabulary even though profoundly ordered our lives Distributed intelligence offers pretty coherent explanation for why democracy triumphed over governments that depended all powerful central processing units And helps explain why American businesses are pushing power responsibility and information away from the center and out the salespeople engineers and suppliers who know the product best Here question that might prove point for the Penn students the audience How many you when you graduate hope climb the corporate ladder rung after rung same company for the next years Let see your hands how many you hope maybe start your own business move from project project navigate whatever exciting webs commerce present themselves The ladder factory metaphor one path one destination step step But the web distributed intelligence metaphor innumerable paths unimaginable destinations any route you choose Just look the changes our economy and our culture Your parents probably read Life Magazine did the rest the country But now almost anyone can publish magazine and many are last count there were many zines America Distributed intelligence Investment advice used come from the gray suited Wall Street expert font all wisdom source all information Now investors are going online with services like the Motley Fool comparing notes with thousands other investors building pool information far deeper than any experts have And the process they beating the pants off the big money crowd Distributed intelligence let bring this full circle Because that clunky old machine the Moore Building which required more than vacuum tubes and drained enough electricity light three houses for entire year how work has changed how organize ourselves has changed how think has changed The ENIAC didn accomplish that directly And all its inventors were here today they would probably astonished what they wrought But the ENIAC funded small investment from Washington provided the spark just ARPANET helped sparked the Internet and the High Performance Computing Initiative helped spark the World Wide Web Two days ago Iowans cast their votes party caucuses that signal the beginning the elections This the last presidential election the century and the first presidential election the distributed intelligence era Our choice pretty clear snuff the spark that helps ignite innovation new businesses and better jobs keep providing that spark and rely the brains and sweat and vision people like you keep America fires blazing You don have rely distributed intelligence for that one you Happy Birthday ENIAC Happy Valentine Day Penn Let get work
