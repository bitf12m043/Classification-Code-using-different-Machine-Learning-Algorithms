follows argue that the Pacifica case the most closely applicable precedent the issue the constitutionality the Decency Act panel three District Court judges basically disagreed with this view and distinguished Pacifica ACLU Reno The primary ground for holding the Act unconstitutional derived from the nature the Internet widespread distributed medium for communication The panel did not believe the indecency term was necessarily unconstitutionally vague overbroad written perhaps rather slanted summary the decision Indecent Speech Any Nonconforming Speech The Communications Decency Act the Decency Act forbids not merely line obscenity but any speech that indecent The Supreme Court has held that the standard for indecent speech defined using the same language the Act any nonconformance with accepted standards morality FCC Pacifica Foundation Merely making any such nonconforming speech available line Web page that might read person under eighteen you would now committing felony under Federal law People have spoken generally expect that the strict legal effect the Decency Act basically benign They base that belief hope two premises either that the Decency Act aimed hard core obscenity that the First Amendment will protect them Both these hopes are simply wrong the law The Supreme Court has already decided against you The landmark case FCC Pacifica Foundation that case the Court upheld the FCC finding that radio station was subject sanctions for broadcasting the famous George Carlin monologue see below The FCC characterized the monologue its findings Commission concluded that certain words depicted sexual and excretory activities patently offensive manner Guess what The Decency Act forbids any comment other communication that context describes terms patently offensive measured contemporary community standards sexual excretory activities organs section Pacifica the Court specifically ruled that the First Amendment did not prevent government regulation that broadcast based its content even though the monologue constituted speech within the meaning the First Amendment the radio station had warned listeners immediately before the broadcast the material did not have prurient appeal and was not obscene indecent filthy vile within the meaning the federal statutes pertaining obscene mail the monologue was not obscene the constitutional sense Powell concurring the Commission objections were based part the content the broadcast radio broadcast unlike other intrusive methods communication can turned off Brennan dissenting citing Lehman Shaker Heights the decision has the effect making completely unavailable adults material which may not constitutionally kept even from children Brennan dissenting the Court rationales could justify the banning from radio myriad literary works novels poems and plays the likes Shakespeare Joyce Hemingway Ben Jonson Henry Fielding Robert Burns and Chaucer Brennan dissenting The remainder this page excerpts direct quote from this landmark opinion you read these opinions majority concurring and dissenting remember that although you may may not agree with the reasoning the Court squarely held that the monologue question was not speech protected the First Amendment That the radio station lost the case you like you can skip straight the ending Majority opinion Justice Stevens delivered the opinion the Court Parts III and and opinion which the Chief Justice Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist joined Parts and This case requires that decide whether the Federal Communications Commission has any power regulate radio broadcast that indecent but not obscene satiric humorist named George Carlin recorded minute monologue entitled Filthy Words before live audience California theater began referring his thoughts about the words you couldn say the public airwaves the ones you definitely wouldn say ever proceeded list those words and repeat them over and over again variety colloquialisms The transcript this recording which appended this opinion indicates frequent laughter from the audience about clock the afternoon Tuesday October New York radio station owned respondent Pacifica Foundation broadcast the Filthy Words monologue few weeks later man who stated that had heard the broadcast while driving with his young son wrote letter complaining the Commission stated that although could perhaps understand the record being sold for private use certainly cannot understand the broadcast same over the air that supposedly you control The complaint was forwarded the station for comment its response Pacifica explained that the monologue had been played during program about contemporary society attitude toward language and that immeidately before its broadcast listeners had been advised that included sensitive language which might regarded offensive some Pacifica stated that was not aware any other complaints about the broadcast The Commission expressed the opinion that should regulated concept indecent intimately connected with exposure children language that describes terms patently offensive measured contemporary standards for the broadcast medium sexual excretory activities and organs times the day when there reasonable risk that children may the audience The Commission identified several words that referred excretory sexual activities organs stated that the repetitive deliberate use those words afternoon broadcast when children are the audience was patently offensive and held that the broadcast was indecent Pacifica takes issue with the Commission definition indecency but does not dispute the Commission preliminary determination that each the components its definition was present Specifically Pacifica does not quarrel with the conclusion that this afternoon broadcast was patently offensive Pacifica claim that the broadcast was not indecent within the meaning the statute rests entirely the absence prurient appeal Prurient appeal element the obscene but the normal definition indecent merely refers nonconformance with accepted standards morality Pacifica argues however that this Court has construed the term indecent related statutes mean obscene that term was defined Miller California Hamling United States holding that the statute coverage limited obscenity the Court followed the lead Justice Harlan Manual Enterprises Inc Day thought that the phrase obscene lewd lascivious indecent filthy vile taken whole was clearly limited the obscene reading well grounded prior judicial constructions statute since its inception has always been taken aimed obnoxiously debasing portrayals sex Hamling the Court agreed with Justice Harlan that section was meant only regulate obscenity the mails reading into the limits set Miller California supra the Court adopted construction which assured the statute constitutionality The reasons supporting Hamling construction section not apply section Pacifica argues that inasmuch the recording not obscene the Constitution forbids any abridgment the right broadcast the radio When the issue narrowed the facts this case the question whether the First Amendment denies government any power restrict the public broadcast indecent language any circumstances For the government has any such power this was appropriate occasion for its exercise The words the Carlin monologue are unquestionably speech within the meaning the First Amendment equally clear that the Commission objections the broadcast were based part its content The order must therefore fall Pacifica argues the First Amendment prohibits all governmental regulation that depends the content speech Our past cases demonstrate however that such absolute rule mandated the Constitution The question this case whether broadcast patently offensive words dealing wtih sex and excretion may regulated because its content Obscene materials have been denied the protection the First Amendment because their content offensive contemporary moral standards Roth United States But the fact that society may find speech offensive not sufficient reason for suppressing Indeed the speaker opinion that gives offense that consequence reason for according constitutional protection For central tenet the First Amendment that the government must remain neutral the marketplace ideas there were any reason believe that the Commission characterization the Carlin monologue offensive could traced its political content even the fact that satirized contemporary attitudes about four letter words First Amendment protection might required But that simply not the case These words offend for the same reasons that obscenity offends have long recognized that each medium expression presents special First Amendment problems The reasons for these distinctions are complex but two have relevance the present case First the broadcast media have established uniquely pervasive presence the lives all Americans Patently offensive indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen not only public but also the privacy the home where the individual right left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights intruder Rowan Post Office Dept Because the broadcast audience constantly tuning and out prior warnings cannot completely protect the listener viewer from unexpected program content say that one may avoid further offense turning off the radio when hears indecent language like saying that the remedy for assault run away after the first blow One may hang indecent phone call but that option does not give the caller constitutional immunity avoid harm that has already taken place Second broadcasting uniquely accessible children even those too young read Although Cohen written message Fuck the Draft across the back his jacket his conviction was overturned First Amendment grounds See discussion might have been incomprehensible first grader Pacifica broadcast could have enlarged child vocabulary instant Other forms offensive expression may withheld from the young without restricting the expression its source Bookstores and motion picture theaters for example may prohibited from making indecent material available children held Ginsberg New York that the government interest the well being its youth and supporting parents claim authority their own household justified the regulation otherwise protected expression and The ease with which children may obtain access broadcast material coupled with the concerns recognized Ginsberg amply justify special treatment indecent broadcasting The judgment the Court Appeals reversed Appendix The following verbatim transcript Filthy Words prepared the Federal Communications Commission Aruba ruba ruba was

opinion Justice Powell with whom Justice Blackmun joins concurring part and concurring the judgment join Parts III and Justice Stevens opinion The Court today reviews only the Commission holding that Carlin monologue was indecent broadcast two clock the afternoon and not the broad sweep the Commission opinion also agree with much that said Part Justice Stevens opinion and with its conclusion that the Commission holding this case does not violate the First Amendment Because not subscribe all that said Part however state views separately conceded that the monologue issue here not obscene the constitutional sense See FCC Brief for Petitioner Some the words used have been held protected the First Amendment other cases and contexts citations omitted not think Carlin consistently with the First Amendment could punished for delivering the same monologue live audience composed adults who knowing what expect chose attend his performance See Brown Oklahoma Powell concurring result And would assume that adult could not constitutionally prohibited from purchasing recording transcript the monologue and playing reading the privacy his own home Stanley Georgia But also true that the language employed most people vulgar and offensive was chosen specifically for this quality and was repeated over and over sort verbal shock treatment The Commission did not err characterizing the narrow category language used here patently offensive most people regardless age The issue however whether the Commission may impose civil sanctions licensee radio station for broadcasting the monologue two clock the afternoon The Commission primary convern was prevent the broadcast from reaching the ears unsupervised children who were likely the audience that hour essence the Commission sought channel the monologue hours when the fewest unsupervised children would exposed See FCC view this consideration provides strong support for the Commission holding The Court has recognized society right adopt more stringent controls communicative materials available youths than those available adults Erznoznik Jacksonville see also citations omitted This recognition stems large part from the fact that child not possessed that full capacity for individual choice which the supposition First Amendment guarantees Ginsberg New York supra Stewart concurring result Thus children may not able protect themselves from speech which although shocking most adults generally may avoided the unwilling through the exercise choice the same time such speech may have deeper and more lasting negative effect child than adult For these reasons society may prevent the general dissemination such speech children leaving parents the decision what speech this kind their children shall hear and repeat argued that despite society right protect its children from this kind speech and despite everyone interest not being assaulted offensive speech the home the Commission holding this case impermissible because prevents willing adults from listening Carlin monologue over the radio the early afternoon hours said that this ruling will have the effect reduc ing the adult population hearing only what fit for children Butler Michigan This argument not without force The Commission certainly should consider develops standards this area But not sufficiently strong leave the Commission powerless act circumstances such those this case The Commission holding does not prevent willing adults from purchasing Carlin record from attending his performances indeed from reading the transcript reprinted appendix the Court opinion its face does not prevent respondent Pacifica Foundation from broadcasting the monologue during late evening hours when fewer children are likely the audience nor from broadcasting discussions the contemporary use language any time during the day The Commission holding and certainly the Court holding today does not speak cases involving the isolated use potentially offensive word the course radio broadcast distinguished from the verbal shock treatment administered respondent here short agree that the facts this case the Commission order did not violate respondent First Amendment rights The result turns instead the unique characteristics the broadcast media combined with society right protect its children from speech generally agreed inappropriate for their years and with the interest unwilling adults not being assaulted such offensive speech their homes Moreover doubt whether today decision will prevent any adult who wishes receive Carlin message Carlin own words from doing and from making for himself value judgment themerit the message and words Young American Mini Theatres Inc Powell concurring These are the grounds upon which join the judgment the Court Part Brennan dissenting Justice Brennan with whom Justice Marshall joins dissenting agree with Justice Stewart that under Hamling United States other citations omitted the word indecent USC section must construed prohibit only obscene speech would therefore normally refrain from expressing views any constitutional issues implicated this case However find the Court misapplication fundamental First Amendment principles patent and its attempt impose its notions propriety the whole the American people misguided that unable remain silent Yet despite the Court refusal create sliding scale First Amendment protection calibrated this Court perception the worth communiation content and despite our unanimous agreement that the Carlin monologue protected speech majority the Court nevertheless finds that the facts this case the FCC not constitutionally barred from imposing sanctions Pacifica for its airing the Carlin monologue This majority apparently believes that the FCC disapproval Pacifica afternoon broadcast Carlin Dirty Words recording permissible time place and manner regulation Kovacs Cooper Both the opinion Brother Stevens and the opinion Brother Powell rely principally two factors reaching this conclusion the capacity radio broadcast intrude into the unwilling listener home and the presence children the listening audience Dispassionate analysis removed from individual notions what proper and what not starkly reveals that these justifications whether individually together simply not support even the professedly moderate degree governmental homogenization radio communications indeed such homogenization can ever moderate given the pre eminent status the right free speech our constitutional scheme that the Court today permits continued Stewart dissenting Statutory interpretation indecent citing Hamling take all impossible read the transcript the Carlin monologue without laughing Try remember his voice delivering this monologue The transcript misses his sense timing but still very effective Far from being the verbal shock treatment the Court complains about straightforward intensely political commentary talented observer terrifying that the Court seems equate the Carlin piece with well Beavis Meaning either that the Court can tell the difference more honestly doesn care about the content disapproves principle and willing leave regulation the bureaucrats And know they can tell the difference the most frightening part the discussion the Court repeated willingness anything the name the children who might listening They might browsing this Web page too reading books library watching cable attending the Million Man March doing any thousand other disturbing things Yes their parents and some best friends are parents are entitled protect them from evil pernicious influence All they have not read Web page that much ask That how got into this Decency Act stuff after all worrying about all those kids browsing all those dirty Web pages Like this one Highly illegal Throw the guy jail And radio can constitutionally regulated this basis why not the Internet read the excerpts and substitute Internet for radio Scary huh don particularly care for swearing even admit that typing portions the above transcript made mildly uncomfortable Still the Government has damn business telling can offend anyone not speech really worried about though The Internet precious roiling confusing complex place The Government has damn business telling you you can offend anyone telling not allowed read what you written whatever The hope for the future see there are only two grounds for distinguishing Pacifica One can argue that the Internet less obtrusive than radio and less plausibly susceptible family hour doctrine appropriate time and place for rated speech Unfortunately the intrusiveness rationale while clearly important the Court frame mind does not distinguish between family hour and other radio programming the Court had held that radio broadcasts like sound trucks were sufficiently intrusive regulated and had banned Carlin monologue entirely for that reason the Internet would safer Instead was the potential access for children that formed the primary basis for the holding Pacifica factor that also present here and central the statute express purpose Alternatively one could hope distinguish Pacifica dealing with civil sanctions rather than criminal penalties statute providing criminal penalties such the Decency Act must generally meet high standard accuracy its definition upset under the void for vagueness doctrine However vagueness not First Amendment issue For example accurate drafting the law can overcome vagueness And case the language transcribed above has already been squarely held the Supreme Court meet the law existing definition would hard for argue vagueness The temporary restraining order granted ACLU Reno acknowledges that the plaintiffs have plausible case and they eventually win would the meantime suffer loss First Amendment rights The Justice Department announcement that will not institute prosecutions for violations the Decency Act until this litigation runs its course only postpones the reckoning particular according that announcement the law upheld the government has reserved the right prosecute later for such speech dating from the passage the law the above discussion correct there significant chance that the law will upheld and that the Justice Department will institute prosecutions for language like mine hope have convinced
