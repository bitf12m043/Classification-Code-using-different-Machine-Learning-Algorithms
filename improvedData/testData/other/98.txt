Yeah figured that out while trying answer Larry questions Like Prof Ruzzo said this pretty dense reading The more read the denser feel Thanks Michael claym washington edu Date Apr PST From Larry Ruzzo ruzzo quinault washington edu Larry Roske roske lynx washington edu Subject cse lynx washington edu other students nicely answered most this have just few more comments Subject have questions regarding Homework First don understand why will run forever any input that rejects rejects string reaches the end and not accept You confusing with finite automata and PDA where reaching the end the input was part the definition acceptance NOT part the definition for Where the end the input after erase add otherwise mangle could define suppose but the definition simpler without you accept you enter accept Period simulates with copy tape and following particular branch via the node addresses given tape some branch results rejecting configuration why shouldn also reject There are perhaps questions here why doesn accept because programmed something else when determines that has reached reject why couldn change reject because then would accept different language than does This really important and often misunderstood feature nondet machines NTM reject sort poorly named dead end might better name Think about the example accepting polynomials having integer roots Give say What happens the path the tree where guesses evaluates gets and enters reject Does that mean has integer root just means the particular guess was following that path didn pan out but means does mean that some many other guesses couldn work this case bazillions paths ending reject don mean the input rejected only the total absence paths ending accept mean that rejects Yes very asymmetric Think like Lotto tickets just because and everyone else happen know buy loosing tickets doesn mean there isn winner Can tell whether there winner looking only ticket can one the lucky winners but not looser you have look ALL the tickets verify they all loosers before you know for sure there winner Second not sure what meant the last sentence page Sometimes symbol may not correspond any choice too few choices are available for configuration Third some clarification the example ADD instruction given combines the use literal and indirect addressing Where literal addressing refers what learned immediate instruction CSE take that the symbol means that literal constant and arrow address Yes The syntax isn important course just happens what remember from the Tyranasauriac assembler Date Apr PST From

fifth problems till the wee hours the morning the way hate having book with errors too far even though this one labeled Preliminary edition havn found any worse that year old editions used and the

accepting prefixes the strings accept Not quite prefix perhaps without any clear boundary marking the end from the begining but they encoded that the boundary between and clearly visible perhaps and are from alphabet like that lacks the and characters and means literally stick and together with those three punctuation characters doing our proof assume usual have got show both directions the statement are prove this case would have show when enumerable must construct and when have that enumberable this correct totally off tangent here Just right Date Apr PDT From Larry Ruzzo ruzzo quinault washington edu cse Subject CSE questions sufficient give informal descriptions the that would accept these languages Also have some trouble seeing the difference between When doing constructing that accept these languages when concatenating and using the sublanguages this case and subroutines couldn just the same while just being careful from depending subroutines that might loop Yes the key difference between and between deciders and acceptors that you must careful that the former always halt and that looping the later doesn cause inputs rejected when you don want them rejected Informal descriptions through out the rest the quarter unless otherwise specified want high level descriptions discussed page Two small points you constructing that decide these languages not merely accept and aren subroutines although machines that decide accept them can hate pedantic about small points like this but think students get themselves confused sometimes deeply confused collection small things like this language set strings decidable there some program say that distinguishes those strings from those strings not And there may lots other programs that can also this job

Extended Static Checking UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON Seattle Washington Department Computer Science and Engineering Box COLLOQUIUM SPEAKER Greg Nelson DEC Systems Research Center TITLE Extended Static Checking DATE Tuesday May TIME PLACE Sieg Hall HOST Anna Karlin ABSTRACT describe system for detecting compile time certain programming errors that are not normally detected until run time and sometimes not even then For example array bounds errors and NIL dereferences special novelty the system its ability detect race conditions and deadlocks multi threaded programs The system requires the programmer annotate procedure declarations with simple preconditions and postconditions These annotations are much less onerous than the annotations that would required for full program correctness proof The checking totally automatic The checker reports errors line number The system implemented for Modula and handles essentially all features the Modula safe language including references objects with single inheritance and concurrency Many parts the standard library for Modula have been checked with the system including the object oriented input output stream library and the generic sequence

Suppose there verifier for that takes pair and accepts rejects time then the poly time NTM that decides works follows input Guess length Accept iff accepts Suppose the NTM decides time The poly time verifier should take pair and accept reject time polynomial that then for some accepts not then for all rejects Hint Use the simulation NTMs DTMs not sure but think Theorem this you recall this similar the problem that showed that language enumerable and only there decidable language such that then for some not then for all not Thus the DTM that decides the verifier for the enumerable language with restrictions running time some sense the class enumerable languages are the class decidable languages Date May PDT From Larry Ruzzo ruzzo quinault washington edu cse Subject late policy

correct definition that self reducible there poynomial time algorithm that can use the subroutine for black box but any calls made must use smaller length than What follows explanation why the

For those you who were unable pick the solutions outside Larry door Solution sketches COLOR and UHAMPATH COLOR complete COLOR via verifier that polynomial time using coloring the vertices the graph certificate can verify that the coloring valid coloring will reduce CNF SAT COLOR Let phi CNF formula The graph that build polynomial time has the vertex set union Set literals union Set Clauses union other vertices Here are the edges classified their type For each variable The gadget For each clause any valid coloring because edges type the vertices and get the different colors Let the colors that they get itself named and Therefore each vertex gets colored any legal coloring Because edges type for any variable and not get different colors Thus legal coloring can always used define assignment values the variables Finally the gadget satisfies the following property Suppose the gadget corresponding the clause and are each constrained get colors from Then there legal coloring the gadget with the clause getting colored iff least one colored This can checked trying out the various combinations color assignments the nodes the gadget You may find easier work with the gadget given the book for literals and then get work for Thus the formula satisfiable iff every clause satisfied some assignment iff there legal coloring UHAMPATH complete show that UHAMPATH belongs the verifier takes the encoding hamiltonian path certificate and verifies that the certificate indeed corresponds hamiltonian path the input graph will reduce HAMPATH UHAMPATH follows Suppose instance HAMPATH Let will create undirected graph follows The vertex set for Informally will force any hamiltonian path between and always correspond directed path the subscripts for the vertices refer middle and out The edges for are For each vertex For each edge edge and edge Claim There hamiltonian path from iff there hamiltonian path from Proof One direction easy Given hamiltonian path can easily construct hamiltonian path For example was the hamiltonian path the hamiltonian path Now for the other direction any hamiltonian path for each vertex the vertices must occur consecutively because interior vertex the path and connected and only Because the path begins with the initial segment must There are edges from for any vertices and the only way this path can extended hamiltonian path for have the form where each abbreviation for the sub path for some vertex Moreover for each vertex there exactly one such that corresponds Suppose the vertex corresponding This can easily transformed hamiltonian path Jayram
