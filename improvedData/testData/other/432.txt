constructing tools aid writing applications that provide good interactive responsiveness even environments where resource availability hard predict highly dynamic Applications that depend networking even indirectly such through networked file system may encounter several orders magnitude bandwidth variability mobile computing environment where the interface can switch between wireless and wired connections Operating systems can not effectively hide such great network variation instead applications need flexible about their resource demands they are remain usable through periods degraded service Towards this end dissertation research develops application framework and runtime system express and manage logical units resource demand concurrency and progressive quality results gaining responsiveness the user interface principally trading off the short term quality the response For further introductory material please read the abstract dissertation The technical details are not yet available online These pages are longer maintainedTry out these demos yourself you running Windows have implemented prototype system test ideas consists set language extensions pre processor convert these into multi threaded code and runtime system manage the dynamic task graph have written three interactive applications using this prototype system library catalog database browser Mandelbrot fractal generator and Web browser for photo albums incremental resolution The latter two are available here for demonstration When system resources are plentiful easy get good response time when resources are scarce that responsiveness support begins help each these demos designed exceed the capacity our local resources Which program would you like run Fractal Explorer generates multiple Mandelbrot fractals incrementally and concurrently with the mouse position controlling priority among windows Photo Album Browser downloads collection photographs with progressively improving quality prioritization among pictures permit the application connect your display execute the UNIX command xhost trouble washington edu Enter your display name xterminal washington edu address TVTWM users this demo tickles fatal bug tvtwm compiled for DEC Alphas Note These applications were meant run near the user the delay between your server and the application large you experience delayed responsive performance meaning that you can still control priority etc but only slowly Other students sometime run large simulations our departmental hosts bringing them their knees You know Things notice and try Fractal Explorer Demo First after reading the directions for operating the program notice that you can zoom fractal while still refining This ability proceed with only incomplete result becomes more important variability system response time increases Today such feature only implemented for those tasks that are expected take long time but system service time increases variability this feature needs implemented for more and more tasks Try zooming two fractal windows rapid succession that they are simultaneously refining their images then move the mouse over one them Notice that the application concentrates its resources the selected fractal The other fractal may get some CPU attention when the primary blocked for thread synchronization Now try the same but point the mouse outside both windows Observe that the two fractals improve resolution roughly the same rate roughly half fast before try the color enhancement feature first zoom part the fractal that has little variation color then quickly type color This runs the entire image through histogram equalization function slow Notice that this function run the successive images produced the fractal generator illustrate what going inside the application the following rapid succession zoom area set the toggle button open new window when zooming then type new window will display the colored version the first window This diagram illustrates the task graph that was generated this sequence user events the green tasks were added when you typed The output from the fractal image generator consumed both display task for the first window and coloring task whose output goes second display task for the other window series refined images passes through this data flow graph When portion the task graph becomes disconnected from useful output such the display internal program variable the runtime system prunes from the graph and garbage collects its associated storage This happens when you zoom fractal that still refining You can witness this the user interface except that the resource savings improve the performance the tasks that you care about Photo Album Browser Demo Suppose you want show friend lunch particular photograph your baby you pull out your mobile computer and access your home photo album via the wireless network Given that downloading all your baby pictures would take long time you want photo album browser that downloads and displays images incrementally and that prioritizes bandwidth consumption among the photos you search for the picture Imagine this scenario you use the browser try find the sunset photograph quickly Keep mind that the Internet provides higher bandwidth than wireless network Also the effect prioritization becomes much more pronounced when the desired priorities for the various network connections are communicated the wireless base station This has been implemented experimental setup but not available for demo the Web observe the effect priority press return the URL window restart the downloads then quickly open two pictures and move the mouse over the later one Observe that the selected picture gets refined faster than the other this more obvious later refinements when the resolution finer Each refinement quadruples the number pixels the image The application pre fetches one picture off the edge the strip observe this restart the downloads wait for few resolution improvements note which picture rightmost the strip then scroll the right few pictures Notice the difference resolution the first picture the right the others George
