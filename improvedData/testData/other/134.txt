From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu certainly recommend that you read the entire chapter but sure read cse Subject Homework Date Tue Apr PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu problem the transmission bandwidth part should Gbps not GHz problem explain what the computer must avoid transmitting quickly the network cse Subject Homework Date Tue Apr PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu problem change error Richard Date Tue Apr From wchan lupine cse Subject you uncomfortable with are going hand out the first project Wednesday You asked modify some the data link protocols the book you feel uncomfortable with you can come office hour today Sieg and can through the protocols the book william cse Subject Lecture clarification Date Wed Apr PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu For all the sliding window policies the receiver must send request with sequence whenever receives frame and the number the first empty slot its window after the frame arrives this way the sender will eventually notified send this frame again Thus line transparency really correct except should read window and frame arrives with different from then ignor the frame but send ack request with seq apologies for the confusion class Richard Date Fri Apr From wchan lupine cse Subject project There are two fields for sequence numbers the frame struct namely seq and ack seq for the sequence number the data while ack for the sequence number the ack The receiver should not put sequence number the seq field would wiped out the simulator Use the ack field instead you use printf print debug information sender receiver the output might mixed and hard read partially fix this copy the new protocol your directory and instead printf mumble use fprintf tty mumble Because the size the class won have time read your code any detail mostly grade your code based correctness your program doesn work make sure you explain what the problem and what you think might cause the problem etc that can give you partial credit william cse Subject Midterm Exam Date Mon Apr PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu The midterm Friday April Bring one inch blue book You may use the first four pages for your personal handwritten notes Use the notes help you organize the material The exam will not test memory but test

Apr PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu Several students have mailed questions for Wednesday session This wonderful gives chance think about the questions can make thoughtful answers you have any questions you can tell ahead time just mail and can hopefully answer Wednesday Here are the questions far What exactly bandwidth thought bandwidth was the range frequencies that given filter would pass this case communication channel wire fiber radio etc However the homeowrks bandwidth used refer data rate and given bps seen this problem from outside sources before well bandwidth just well defined but sometimes sloppily applied term have some doubts reg PAR and ABP You said can fix PAR putting seq into acks isn that what the ABP does there any other difference What the difference between ABP and protocol All good questions let have more Richard Date Tue Apr From wchan William Chan cse Subject Project question problem you ask what could wrong the data frames not carry sequence numbers and the request frames not carry sequence numbers Are you asking what would happen the data frames not carry sequence numbers and the request frames carry sequence numbers And then separately the request frames not carry sequence numbers and the data frames Yes william cse Subject Last years midterm Date Wed Apr PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu put extra copies the midterm the bottom slot hanger outside door Sieg don have solution set for the midterm but would happy explain any solutions during office hour today tomorrow from Richard cse Subject Midterm Date Wed May PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu mentioned class today the solution problem the midterm transposed selective repeat and back Also the mean the midterm was with high and low near you can see from the midterm emphasizing problem solving over memory work preparation for the final will pass out old final that you can prepare solving those old problems study for the final you will want practice the kind work that will expected Richard cse lazowska borning Subject Warning Date Fri May PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu There were quite few students not class today just want warn those you that did not come class today that covered the binary tree protocols depth This topic not covered deeply the book There will assignment this

that you are paying for cse Subject Bad Calculation Date Fri May PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu The calculation did class calculating the number bits wire running Mbps was wrong What wrote was sec sec The correct calculation sec sec Thus two frames cannot pass the night Needless say jamming done probably because safer and scales longer wires and higher bandwidths That teach try doing calculation real time Please please stop during class when you see make such errors Richard Date Sun May From wchan calvin William Chan cse Subject project stuff Except for protocol when there timeout the simulator always says the timeout was for frame changed worker that tells which sequence number timed out You can get the new worker from the simulator directory Let know you find other bugs Also you haven noticed put solution project cse courses cse simulator solution don think able finish grading project Wednesday But you novice and want give you some feedback before you hand part project let know william Date Tue May PDT From Barak Water barak grizzly washington edu cse grizzly washington edu Subject Sim and Linux For what worth case anyone interested even mildly curious moment frustration with Grizzly being really ftp the simulator Linux box compiled and discovered pleasure that not only compiles but behaves the same Grizzly This may old news some but seemed worth mentioning Take care all Barak Water cse Subject What read Chapters and Date Tue May PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu You will definitely need read the following sections

changed typedef enum frame arrival cksum err timeout network layer ready ack timeout event type just fixed this the simulator directory You can start the ack timer calling start ack timer and stop calling stop ack timer When the ack timer goes off event ack timeout occurs william cse Subject Queuing Theory Date Mon May PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu probably didn explain myself very well Let give example have two incoming lines and one outgoing line switch each with the same bandwidth know that cell arrivals are statistical rate and similarly for Thus the overall arrival rate the switch This will cause the average queue length the switch infinity the arrivals are Poisson which basically means that the arrivals are completely independent then can proven that this true appears the surface that the switch can handle the arrival rate Indeed can assuming has unbounded storage space storage space bounded then will eventually overflow Richard Date Mon May From wchan lupine cse Subject project Sorry about the delay Project has been graded and you should have received your score you haven but you did turn the project let know william Date Thu May From wchan lupine cse Subject project ready put project the web and put xerox copies outside the professor office you want hardcopy before Friday the professor office Sieg and pick copy Otherwise will

Date Mon May PDT From Richard Ladner ladner whalespout washington edu Question Regarding Assignment were wondering how the switch works there one queue for all incoming traffic are there separate queues for each sender receiver Are these channels independent each other Answer The important thing that there single buffer pool for all arrivals When packet arrives and there buffer free gets the packet The full buffer then put the outgoing queue Once the packet sent the buffer becomes free again Date Wed May From Demian Godon dgodon washington edu Organization University Washington cse
