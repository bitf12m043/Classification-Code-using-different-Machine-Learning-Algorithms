what you have Some the last message this included here Heuristic Selection the Best Transformation Proving Trigonometric Identities due Friday May This project involves symbolic problem solving creation representation that facilitates implementation and learning The learning part simply involves being able use problems that have been solved the program improve problem solving power later The problem start with five simple trigonometric identities such tan sin cos cot cos sin cosec sin sec cos sin cos and use them operators transform the left side new trig equation until the right side produced The problem will solved that point The first thing here find way represent the problem and the operators including operators which will added problems are solved that programming will simple possible Then features the left and right sides the operators and the problem identities have chosen which will help both deciding which operator apply and where apply will cover most this class but you should think about example given the above five trig identities operators how would you solve the problems Prove that tan cot etc Also how you write lisp functions deal with all possible cases implement problem solver that would start with the five basic identities prove new identities and then add those identities the set available for solving future problems would require more programming than you could short time you are going given set initial identities standard form and you will have write lisp program select the best transformation identity for given problem identity You will make three possibly different selections based three different heuristics Standard Form Replace sin with the symbol cos with tan with cot with cosec with and sec with Remove all signs moving terms the other side the identity remove all signs multiplying throughout the denominator remove all exponents repeated multiplication and remove all integer coefficients repeated addition For example sin cos would become The final step lexically order each side the identity and then switch sides necessary that the left side lexically before the right side Thus tan sin cos would become and then Identities are restricted trig functions single variable The standard form sum products form with the product terms lexically ordered This form greatly reduces the variability representation for equivalent identities good example general rule Transform problem into standard form that the variety equivalent forms reduced far possible Your program will assume that its inputs are trig identities given the standard form You will given list identities which can used transforms and one more identities problem identities You should write three functions one for each the three heuristic methods defined below Each function will then have select the best transform identity first applied solving the problem proving that the left side the problem identity can transformed into its right side The three functions will usually pick different transform identities The three heuristic methods will named Simplification Familiarization and the Effectiveness Heuristic Simplification Heuristic Here the scoring function the difference the number the symbols the left and right sides the transform identity Before identity can selected one its sides must applicable the left side the problem identity Problem Prove that sin tan cos sec Standard Form Here the transform identity can applied the left side the problem and the simplification score there are symbols left side including the sign and one symbol right side Applying the left side will reduce the number symbols All the with the same greatest score will selected Your program has print out the scores for all the identities for the given problem and the identification numbers the identities Familiarization Heuristic The transform identities will the first identities the list Table given out Packet Their numbers are also listed You will use list these numbers indicate the familiarity score the transform identities The first the list show the most familiar identity the second the next most familiar etc The transform identity chosen here will the one closest the head the list which can applied the left side the problem identity Effectiveness Heuristic This one more complex and supposed provide score called which measure the applicability either the left right sides the identity the left side the identity and also the degree which the identity likely make the left side the identity more like the right side the identity Thus approximate measure the degree which will make the left side the current problem become closer the right side the goal Define the feature set the left side the set single trig objects left side the set all different pairs trig objects product terms and the set all pairs product terms where any common objects are taken away divided out Make feature set for the left side the right side the left side each and the right side each The feature sets will already available For each feature will use weight indicate its complexity This will sum symbols the feature This will give added importance matching features which have lots symbols for the same above Flp the feature set for the left side with the corresponding weight for each feature Frp There will available similar feature sets for all the available identities The score computed adding together the weights all features present with each weight multiplied desirablity factor which intended show the single feature associated with given going help hinder finding solution compute each feature Flt and Frt examined and compared the feature set the left and right sides Each such feature will then have its weight and its desirability factor Then Sum for all features Flt and Frt find there are various possibilities feature could the left side and not the right side and could the left side and not the right side This situation will described This very desirable situation since applying the left side the left side will remove feature from the left side and this feature not the right side this will help solve the problem The other situations with their scores are These factors are quite arbitrary Using the same example before Flp Frp Let assume that the following being scored Flt Frt The features from will scored one time giving for the situation here and the feature adds The features all have After they are considered When the feature considered and this contributes the effectiveness score for applying this this Notes For the familiarity heuristic use the list The integers the list correspond the first identities the list from packet Problem Identities used your program Find the best identity using each the three above heuristics separately for each the following identities and Your program should print out all the scores computed and the the selected For each problem only the first has found
