collaborative learning Background Papers SIGCUE Outlook Computer Supported Collaborative Learning Spring Volume number Included this journal introduction Computer Support for Collaborative Learning Design Theory and Research Issues Tim Koschmann CACM Volume Number Recent CACM issue Learner Centered Design Journal the Learning Sciences Volume number Special Issue Computer Support for Collaborative Learning Included this journal are two articles Tim Koschmann Toward Theory Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and Using Technology Assist Realizing Effective Learning and Instruction Principled Approach the Use Computers Collaborative Learning Both are pretty thick papers but may shed some light how CSCL Clements and Nastasi The Role Social Interaction the Development Higher Order Thinking Logo Environments Computer Based Learning Environments and Problem Solving Corte and Linn and Mandl and Verschaffel Springer Verlag Clements and Nastasi tested Logo with children cooperative environment where two kids used one keyboard order determine how conflict and successful resolution helps hinders learning Their conclusion was that Logo seems help conflict resolution and development higher order thinking present synchronous Dockterman Cooperative Learning and Computers SIGQUE Outlook Collaborative learning for social studies and history states that cooperative learning has been overused The article also states that there are obstacles cooperative learning such lack teacher experience too much material cover and that computers may help overcome these obstacles assisting class management information flow and record keeping Inkpen Booth Klawe and Upitis Playing Together Beats Playing Apart Especially for Girls Proc CSCL Bloomington October ACM Press This study compared children using The Incredible Machine various situations two together one machine same sex and mix sexed pairs children working independently There are other papers that can used for back material including the GEMS tech report present synchronous Palmer and Fields Guest Editor Introduction Computer Supported Cooperative Work IEEE Computer May good introduction computer supported cooperative work Categorizes CSCW modes and gives glossary terms Vockell Group Size for Computerized Instruction Educational Technology This paper begins describing the three types learning individualistic competitive cooperative and the two phases learning learning phase where students receive feed back and clarifications and the practice phase where computers can useful The paper also discusses what group size good for different phases and types learning Systems and applications papers Background papers the different types systems CSCW How can classify these systems Bier and Freeman MMM User Interface Architecture for Shared Editors Single Screen UIST Hilton Head November ACM Press MMM stands for Multi Device Multi User Multi Editor This the only other work found where they use multiple mice single machine good paper and talks about some the problems sharing screen space etc present synchronous Bricker Tanimoto Rothenberg Hutama Wong Multiplayer Activities Which Develop Mathematical Coordination Proc CSCL Bloomington October ACM Press Our work from couple years ago present Synchronous Bricker Baker and Tanimoto Support for Cooperatively Controlled Objects Multimedia Applications Work progress This paper presents methodology for designing objects that encourage close collaboration multimedia environments definition given for cooperatively controlled objects which distinguishes them from objects whose components are shared present synchronous Cockburn and Greenberg Children Collaboration Styles Newtonian MicroWorld Proc Proceedings CHI Human Factors Computing Systems April Vancouver ACM SIGCHI This paper describes Turbo Turble distributed animated multi user microworld Each user has presence the screen indicated colored cursor There another paper this CSCL Distance Synchronous Gisi and Sacchi CAD Collaborative Mechanical CAD System PRESENCE Describes general features CSCW systems including shared design data semantic view customizable views WYSIWIS but also adds view synchronization Shared pointer individual pointers ownership objects like Unix joining leaving sessions Gutwin Stark and Greenberg Support for Workspace Awareness Educational Groupware Proceedings CSCL Bloomington October ACM Press GroupKit set controls designed give distance cooperative users awareness their collaborators workspace This paper describes workspace awareness and some the controls There also suite papers CHI which describes more the controls and how they can used Distance synchronous Patterson Hill and Rohall Rendezvous Architecture for Synchronous Multi User Applications Proceedings CSCW Los Angeles October ACM Press Actually there also another paper from UIST which also describes this system Distance Synchronous Pozzi Peterc Concoliino Nitto and Moninaro ImageAnnotator Image Based Cooperative Application cooperative image processing application Shen and Dewan Access Control for Collaborative Environments Proceedings CSCW Toronto October November ACM Press Using access control methods support sharing collaborative environment They discuss the rules and architecture used distributed collaborative
