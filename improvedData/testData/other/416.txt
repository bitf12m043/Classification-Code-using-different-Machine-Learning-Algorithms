summary the highlights and import the recent June decision the litigation the constitutionality the Communications Decency Act the Act ACLU Reno The result The three judge District Court panel issued preliminary injunction preventing enforcement the criminal provisions the Decency Act The constitutionality the Act has not been definitively established since the panel has not held trial nor has the decision been reviewed the Supreme Court Nonetheless the unanimous opinion the three judge court the first major judicial review the Act and their reasoning and conclusions are important predictor the ultimate resolution the litigation Expedited review preliminary injunctions action for preliminary injunction constitutional grounds such ACLU Reno the federal statute dealing with district court civil procedure provides for expedited review three judge court one whom Buckwalter the judge that heard the preliminary testimony and evidence hearing request for preliminary injunction not equivalent full trial the merits Instead the judges are asked determine merely whether there reasonable probability success the eventual trial There are additional requirements including irreparable harm that plaintiff must show get preliminary injunction but First Amendment context those additional requirements are not controversial Even least one judge Dalzell thought the statute unconstitutional its face period And another Buckwalter pointed out that they had gathered significant amount testimony and other evidence that unlike the original TRO hearing this decision indeed solidly grounded fact The Comstock Act anti abortion provisions The panel did not need reach the question the constitutionality the Comstock Act provisions dealing with information about abortion since the Government apparently conceded its unconstitutionality without further argument The Government has stated that does not contest plaintiffs challenge the enforceability the provision the CDA relates The factual assumptions important part the impact the case the set factual assumptions which the reasoning was based The Government and the plaintiffs agreed paragraph stipulation that the panel incorporated its findings additional findings reflected extensive testimony for example about commercial Web screening products The most important finding was the following Communications over the Internet not invade individual home appear one computer screen unbidden Users seldom encounter content accident This finding allowed the judges distinguish the Internet from the invasive radio broadcast Pacifica Another important fact which the opinion rested least part was the incompleteness the Government proposed tagging scheme The Government argued that the defense appropriate actions under the circumstances might include system for warnings about possible indecent content However the Government was not willing endorse any particular scheme guaranteeing statutory protection and the panel was not willing rest the constitutionality the statute this vague ground Discussion about Pacifica The panel believed that the specific Carlin monologue would also treated indecent under the CDA Therefore order find the CDA unconstitutional the panel would have distinguish Pacifica The panel pointed several possible grounds for distinguishing the Pacifica case The Decency Act imposes criminal penalties this greater infringement First Amendment freedoms would normally require stronger showing compelling governmental interest well leaving the statute open attack based vagueness related First Amendment parlance the concept over breadth The media argument that while radio basically intrusive the Internet not rests primarily the fact discussed above about accidental exposure indecent material The panel also believed that the scarce resource quality radio bandwidth made regulation the public interest more constitutionally permissible than regulation the more diffuse decentralized Internet The difficulty defining community standards the international transparency and the technical obstacles faced children gaining access the Internet all added the panel willingness distinguish Pacifica Finally the panel believed that the impact the Pacifica case had been limited the recent cable television case Turner Broadcasting System one judge Dalzell put Time has not been kind the Pacifica decision The Justice Department position The Administration argued against the Decency Act during the Congressional legislative process but now the same Justice Department the posture arguing uphold seems that this perfectly appropriate one wouldn want Administration rule undercut Congressional legislation selectively choosing whether not enforce laws based its political views Interestingly though the panel pointed Justice Department letter arguing that the Decency Act was unnecessary combat child pornography undercutting any claim compelling governmental interest the Administration has some sense shot itself the foot which good for opponents the Act Back home eric washington edu Jul
