demo program called demo exe will the same But for lab report question the the demo exe version exhibits the infinite loop behavior please use that version when you come question Otherwise everything the same Thanks several early bird students for discovering this problem lab report question couple people have reported that the demo program does NOT loop forever under the conditions described question looking this and right now think might because the exe was created for Windows whereas our own test version was compiled for Win any case for now please ignore question come back another time

programming found our surprise that wasn easy get programs right had thought Debugging had discovered can remember the exact instant when realized that large part life from then was going spent finding mistakes own programs Maurice Wilkes British computer pioneer quoted Expert Programming Deep Secrets Peter van der Linden Prentice Hall turn form now available the Web The Mac version now available download Please report any problems with either via mail mentioned below you are likely fill your diskette once you have created and run and Aside from starting with blank high density disk single density definitely too small ask for help you are not sure your disk formatted the correct density there are some techniques for avoiding the problem One copy your files directory the hard drive and create default project there The Windows Explorer can used create directories and copy files you this sure copy your updated files back the floppy for safekeeping before restarting your computer all changes the hard drive are automatically erased when the machine restarts will try post some details these suggestions later different approach the problem what the mdp and mak files provided the archive they have settings which instruct MSVC place all the intermediate files temporary directory the hard drive while allowing your file stay the floppy You could this yourself adjusting the Settings the Build menu any case all the intermediate files ilk pdb and many others can safely deleted from your floppy they are automatically rebuilt when needed How closely does your solution have follow the samples Well your version should always give correct answer valid reasonable data But the input data types are wrong for example typing character when integer expected then the sample not guaranteed run correctly and your program doesn need either the data type right but the values are unexpected then both programs should able handle and pretty much the same way The exact wording output not crucial long correct and appropriate you find cases where our program seems wrong please send mail with particulars give the exact input values that produce the bad answers you sure our program not right for particular case then you don have make yours the same wrong thing The final hit any key terminate the program hit any key continue are not essential parts the solution They are only there guarantee that the window stays the screen that can read When running from within MSVC they aren needed but you launch the program from the Explorer they may put new version the archive the Web you happy with the old one there need load the new one The new version has called bit executable sample programs These will run Windows well Windows They look slightly different the background color white instead black and when the program finishes you have close the window clicking the close the upper right hand corner also corrected some minor details that various you had pointed out thanks and commendation for getting started quickly None these are important far how your program works and how graded What counts getting the right answers for good data and the
