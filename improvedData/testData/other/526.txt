Web provides addressing and resource naming conventions that permit several kinds computer resources shared globally These resources include Hypertext and hypermedia documents Still images and movies Interactive menus buttons and dialogs File transfer Access these resources available through application software known Web viewers browsers There inherent centralized organization the Web result Web indexes and search mechanisms have been developed Users are free build their own hypertext index save pointers Web pages lists Mosaic Hot List Netscape Bookmark feature These lists are controlled menus included the browser interface The NSF has designated the integration Web browsers into the client workstation desktop research priority for the World Wide Web This integration would eliminate the lack symmetry between user local files documents and services and those available the World Wide Web done right believe would assist the user the organization and access this content that items found once could easily found again What Does Integrate Into The Desktop Mean The NSF research priorities don explain detail the phrase integrate into the desktop For this project will assume that desktop refers user interface software such Microsoft Windows Program Manager and File Manager Apple Macintosh Finder Windows window managers mwm twm These user interfaces provide the following services varying degress Organize view present available files resources documents Launch applications tasks projects Permits user personalize their workstation How Organize Resources Today today desktop interfaces there are different ways organizing and displaying local and Web resources Local ResourcesHierarchical file systems Hierarchical viewers and Nested folders Program groups Varying degrees support for direct manipulation drag and drop Web ResourcesHot list with without limited nesting Bookmarks with without limited nesting Menu driven dialog driven control write our own HTML pages ProblemsBefore discussing what exactly meant integration browser into desktop let list some the problems casual users seem have using the Web each case let also ask this problem might appear with any distributed decentralized collection resources first noticed several these problems watching user navigate the Web while trying build set Web pages serve topic tutorial There support for direct manipulation arrangement Web views Today browsers have most only primitive mechanisms for organizing Web resources according personal preference Hot lists are hierarchical but menu driven and non visual Bookmarks have similar limitations Marc Andreeson inventor Mosaic and founder Netscape admitted recent talk that indexing navigational aides and content organization will quickly supersede current layout and design issues and that ultimately user will have complete control over how content viewed Cumbersome menus prohibit the fly organization Users often spend time finding the same page more than once Accessing Web page you seen before not quick and painless Some people can remember long URL strings many people can Hotlists and bookmarks help but these grow size they become difficult manage brief experiment where person was instructed locate and arrange Web pages the subject often had locate the page several times because had forgotten the URL Users must remember and type URLs Home page uses may conflict the purpose home page organize the owner view the Web the purpose let others know about the owner and the owner interests These are not the same goals Preliminary User Studies Organization and NavigationTo focus the ways which user retains and organizes access Web documents studied novice Web user the next section try explain how this would work Comments and suggestions are welcome Later have more say regarding the desktop metaphor The following ideas guided our design Leverage interactions with current desktop software Visualize Web similar storage devices like disks Use icons represent Web pagesUse hierachical nested views organized Web pages Provide direct manipulation operations Web page icons Activate icon launches pages Icons can generated and saved desktop viewPaper Prototype DesignWe included description and drawings tour our design User Study With PrototypeWe invited out test subject play with our paper prototype Our observations and her suggestions are described this section DiscussionIn one sense integrating Web access into the computer desktop really means integrating Web objects into other applications the desktop The desktop serves organize and launch the computer resources support some activity Many common task can initiated direct manipulation techniques that move document onto icons representing available services like Printer Mailbox Newer platforms are capable supporting interfaces see VRML and Hot Java This work could implemented interface but would not take advantage perspective eye position and viewing direction Several hierachy views could used visualize the user organization Web documents visualization may more useful for navigation and exploration the Web than organization Metaphors haven tried apply novel reality based metaphor That may either curse blessing Instead decided extend the popular desktop metaphor feel that this metaphor several its implementations has assumed form life its own almost separate from physical desktops Computer users today for the most part are familiar with some desktop GUI The use folders organize directory trees has proven useful desktops even though physical file folders are not often hierarchies have envisioned extension these metaphors that attempts make network resources appear similar local resources This has already been done some extent with prporietary networks and research prototypes but not specifically with the Web What envisoned consistent with standalone computer desktops need however address network delay and reliability accessing network resources what way would user accept asynchronous activities for example would make sense delegate something agent dispatch and ask for interruption upon completion This approach retains the key problem interfacing with large deep hierarchy Items deep the hierarchy are hard see Find File Search tool usually provided help users find what they have buried class mentioned several metaphors for Web access that differ greatly from the desktop metaphor The Web ocean the Web highway for example discussed these metaphors and decided that they have more use metaphors for navigation and browsing fishing trawling wandering road trip When applied organization problem they don appear offer assistance real life cannot arrange the ocean the interstate highway system suit our own needs SummaryWe have discussed several extensions this approach The drag and drop mechanism could used connect documents and objects services The objects and the services could local remote Example objects include movies audio pictures spreadsheets and commodities for sale Services could include viewers word processors spreadsheet applications mailers printers fax software shopping and purchasing software and personal organizers The Web information structure could extended support these additional object types This would associate services with objects similar the MIME concept Default operations for direct manipulation could associated with the service object combination The desktop appears suitable way for users organize their personal views the Web But does not seem provide ideal metaphor for exploration navigation Metaphors appropriate for explorations are still needed The interface could support personal annotations overlaying the document page with Post type annotations that could stuck anywhere the document These would associated with and accessible from the document icon They would stored locally and attached whenever the document was referenced Our approach could suggest modifications the Web information structure and HTML Authors and users often collect links into page that acts directory folder Often these pages have content their own may contain personal annotations What HTML were extended incorporate directories folders instead logical types like ordered and unordered lists Browsing software and viewers could then support presentation metaphors suited more for organiztion than for reading extension would neither force authors use nor viewing software present differently from document feel that Web viewing software can easily enhanced support dynamic personalized organization Leveraging existing desktop software natural way this Joseph Sherman Last modified Friday May
