Objects Lauren Bricker Marla Baker and Steve TanimotoDepartment Computer Science Engineering University Washington Box Seattle USA Project Goal The goal this project design and develop software package support the implementation collaborative learning activities This package will include shell application application program interface API and hierarchy objects The package supports the development end user educational programs that enforce tightly synchronized interaction and facilitate communication and cooperation between two more users What Cooperatively Controlled Object Definition Cooperatively Controlled Object object oriented terminology object contains state and has behavior define controlled object object containing methods which allows users manipulate properties that object cooperatively controlled object CCO controlled object which may simultaneously manipulated one more users CCOs may manipulated using general methods such constraints between user inputs and application objects CCO differs from fine grained shared object FGSO number ways One major difference the nature the relationship between the object and how controlled The more complicated this relationship the more the object Cooperatively Controlled One method for quantifying how complicated the control object measuring the input degrees freedom required for moving the object Thus CCO has requires more inputs than FGSO Example Figure shows example where point controlled decomposing into its and coordinates which are modified separate users cooperatively controlled point the other hand may involve more general functional relationship between user inputs and controlled properties For example the controlled point could determined the intersection two lines controlled four users each user directly manipulating the location one two points line with mouse Figure Controlling the location point using fine grained sharing technique Figure Cooperatively controlling the location point Discussion CCOs and FGSOs are different how synchronous the actions the users must The interaction between users FGSO not definition synchronous CCO the other hand may require more than one user synchronously manipulate the object good example this symphony orchestra One person could principle record the various orchestra parts symphony track track but the are more subtle interactions when whole group plays the music simultaneously order ensure that users control object synchronously all users must informed that their input needed the manipulation that object For example user wishes manipulate object they would select specific tool and use that modify that object the our current design the user colored cursor changes shape indicate which tool being used and the object will sprout handles which matching the user color signify which users need help CoImage Activities have currently designed and partially implemented three collaborative activities The first one was based the Mathematics Experiences Through Image Processing METIP Image Warper The interface looks very similar but students can cooperatively interact with line each selecting endpoint and moving them simultaneously Our second activity designed Marla Baker collaborative puzzle activity Currently each puzzle piece modified single user although users can work simultaneously but eventually users will forced rotate each piece together Our third activity the cooperative Etch sketch this activity users manipulate point draw picture the screen Currently the point shared scroll bars controlling the and coordinates but will soon implement other cooperative control the drawing point CoImage the internet The CCOs described here are not limited present situation Eventually these objects will implemented for distance internet based collaboration Until then you can use single user version CoImage across the internet following these instructions Previous workMETIP MultiIn
