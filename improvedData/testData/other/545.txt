elsewhere campus you may wondering whether you can use for your assignments instead the Sieg lab The answer yes and many students have done but quite honestly not completely easy will certainly help you are already somewhat adept with computers have tried organize the course will not stand the way this but you will largely your own leaping number hurdles The added convenience being able work home may compensate for this you plan use computer work sure that your employer knows and approves Some employers have policy against the use company equipment company time for personal use but may make exception for education order able work outside the Sieg lab you need stay connected get compiler editor linker and debugger learn how transfer files and learn about certain annoying differences between your computer and ours different options regarding long ints Yes even Mac users Stay connected matter where you compute required that you keep touch with what happening class and with announcements made through the World Wide Web class messages and electronic mail For come lecture and quiz section you have miss one two check the online lecture notes and ask friend for synopsis For various approaches are possible Come into the lab regularly Visit another lab campus regularly the time this writing the Academic Computer Center the southwest corner Brooklyn and Pacific has about PCs running Microsoft Visual well some Macs running Think Both have Netscape They have longer hours than the Sieg lab hour access during the academic year less summer See the lab schedules The computer lab Suzallo has Netscape but compilers you have computer and appropriate high speed modem home You can get Internet connection and dial into Then you could use Netscape access the class Web whose URL http www washington edu education courses you are not Windows Computing and Communications provides dialup Internet access SLIP PPP students Click here for details including directions for obtaining the necessary software either floppy downloading You can also find these Dial files for both PCs and Macintoshes the Sieg lab Questions are best directed the people their phone numbers and mail address can found their Web pages you have Windows home you don need the dial software Win has networking software built For quick start look Win information well the more general information mentioned above Get compiler editor linker and debugger For the bulk the course work you will need ANSI compiler plus associated editor linker and debugger Usually all these components will bundled one package The Microsoft Visual program used Sieg you have large enough MSVC strongly recommended However takes quite bit disk space and runs best with fast CPU MSVC available the University Bookstore for about plus tax tried but were unable arrange even better discount for students this course The Borland compiler another popular tool for PCs but will not supported course staff the extent that MSVC will For Macintosh Think for Macintosh sold Symantec includes all the needed pieces available the University Book Store with student price about you are planning continue CSE you will also want compiler Symantec for Macintosh not called Think includes Think well and associated tools The University Book Store student price about These are the products have installed the Sieg lab and are probably safe bet for home use Version the latest version for Power Mac only are using version the lab and not yet know whether version will work smoothly with version Many people think Metrowerks Codewarrior even better system although switching its files from the Symantec systems the labs not fully automatic Whatever you buy our strongly held opinion that first rate symbolic debugger will extremely valuable for this class and any subsequent work you For the later graphics assignments you will find will impossible use DOS based products and difficult impossible use older versions the Borland and Microsoft compilers Borland prior version and Microsoft prior version date students have not had much luck with Symantec product for Windows suggest you avoid unless you already own Before buying any computer product find out about compatibility with your existing system When you into the store know least your computer CPU type speed memory size available hard drive space and operating system Some software including MSVC requires ROM for installation Read the package label carefully And caveat emptor You might also able use compilers the campus Unix machines but think the lack suitable graphical user interfaces and debuggers will huge obstacle particular they will limited use the later graphical homeworks you not want buy compiler you can write and edit your programs almost any computer with simple text editor word processor saving your file plain text This may let you the bulk your typing home then bring the file the lab for testing may take little experimentation figure out how indentation tabbing and line breaking appropriately general tabs are avoided because the different ways which they are displayed different contexts particular what you see may different from what displayed when you print the output you have turned Transfer files For many the assignments will provide files you sample code skeleton the solution test data etc and expect you provide files with your solutions Outgoing file transfer options are about the same above bring disk the lab use Netscape comparable browser turn files you can bring disk the lab use Netscape Note that you have IBM compatible the file transfer issues are complicated slightly the fact that IBMs and Macintoshes use different file formats The lab Macintoshes have Apple File Exchange software installed they can read and write IBM format floppies but occasional troubles still arise Mac file transfer See Downloading Macintosh Binaries for more information about downloading Macintosh files without visiting the lab Summary short possible work outside the Sieg Lab were reasonably careful setting the course would not preclude that possibility But you should expect few headaches and unfortunately may difficult find help certainly not know everything about every combination hardware and software light this strongly recommend that you the first assignment least our lab you have graceful fallback just case and always allow yourself ample time for final testing debugging and electronic turn case bugs incompatibilities show that stage Comments cse webmaster washington edu Last Update
