Date Tue Dec GMT Server NCSA Content type text html CSE ProjectThe Traveling Tourist Problem summer vacation and you have purchased Greyhound Bus pass allowing you unlimited travel Can you visit every city the United States before your vacation ends This the Traveling tourist problem The CSE course project implement algorithms for the Traveling Tourist Problem and test them out various data sets The Speedy Tourist Page keeps track the best tours found each the problem instances the project data set The Challenge Page gives few specific challenges and Lower bound page gives the best known lower bounds Last update Eric Anderson has developed applet animate tours The Traveling Tourist Problem can viewed politically correct version the Traveling Salesman Problem where travel restricted public transportation The TTP easily shown complete instance the Traveling Tourist Problem given providing schedule which lists the departure time each bus The schedules are periodic only necessary give single day schedule The goal find minimum duration tour which visits every city and gets back the original city tour allowed visit the same city multiple times Since the problem complete unlikely that you can find algorithm that efficiently solves large instances natural look for approximation algorithms which find good but maybe not optimal tours Another option implement exponential algorithm and use solve small instances the problems this project you should investigate both approaches for the Traveling tourist problem Try come with good approximations and also implement branch and bound solve smaller instances exactly There lot literature the Traveling salesman problem that suggests number approaches However there are significant differences between the two problems will necessary invent new algorithms This project modelled after various DIMACS Challenges where researchers were invited implement algorithms solve specific problems important aspect the DIMACS Challenges was publically available set problem instances which made possible directly compare results this challenge the problem well possible complete problem the two competitions are come with good approximations large instances and solve smaller instances exactly with branch and bound algorithm far know this isn well studied problem there should chance prove some interesting theorems well How Participate welcome participation from outside University Washington CSE class The data files and source code are available from the web you can find better tours the official instances send them and will update the hall fame hope automate this soon will also keep track lower bound results various instances Details Here are few details exactly how the problem formulated and what solution Theory don know any results related this problem although haven looked either The theory page will contain some useful theorems well pointers the literature Contributions welcome Data Sets The current data sets were randomly generated although some them are based upon the locations for real cities Each instance specifies schedule file city file starting city and starting time would interested receiving real data sets add set instances Source Code and Support Software Some source code available use your own risk This code handles and provides some very primitive graphics capabilities There also algorithm which finds very bad tours You can use the showmap showsch and showtour programs examine the data files you submit tour make sure that conforms the format tour file Mechanics For the CSE course project there are few rules regulations and deadlines anderson washington edu
