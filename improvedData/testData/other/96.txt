problem student pointed out that many you looked version quicksort that switched doing insertion sort when the problem size was less than some small total you least insertion sorts small subproblems size most Although related this NOT the version that you are analyze Rather than switching insertion sort the bottom the recursion says NOTHING when the subproblems are size just return leaving that subproblem unsorted Patch ALL these small unsorted subproblems with ONE global insertion sort the end This has slight advantage practice since you only setup run the insertion sort loops once rather than times cse geoduck Subject proofs correctness Date Tue Jan PST From Martin Tompa tompa geoduck washington edu student asked for suggestions models how proofs correctness algorithms particular Stooge sort and Quicksort the homework ask for correctness proofs both these cases the fact that problem being reduced smaller problems either recursion iteration suggests proof induction the size the problem Using induction think you can come with reasonably rigorous proof each case the case Quicksort there are least two ways applying induction you can either appeal the induction hypothesis once per iteration for the recursive call you can have exactly two appeals the induction hypothesis one for the first recursive call and one for what accomplished together all iterations after the first Date Wed Jan From aberman hobbes Andrew Berman cse hobbes Proof Tips CSE Here are some tips writing good readable proofs This document not complete guide proofwriting like one those for ourselves hope however that this document will help people who are little unsure what good proof looks like Proofs are communications proof not abstract mathematical construct very concrete and specific communication Specifically you are communicating others that they should believe something Most the points this note follow from this paradigm Include Commentary Sometimes students get the idea that isn equation shouldn the proof That not true While comment doesn substitute for logical inference can help the reader understand what logical inference you are using Organization good proof will easy read and understand Organization helps Think the proof path for the reader follow Tell the reader what the goals subgoals are and then show the reader how these goals are reached Here simple example prove that will first show that and then will show show that induction now show that contradiction Since from and from transitivity Label things you are going use standard method such induction you must use the conventions the method inductive proof that includes labeling the base case inductive hypothesis and inductive steps such Don use the reduction strategy Strategies such induction are useful because there guarantee that you use the strategy correctly then you will wind with correct proof One strategy sometimes used prove start off with and reduce the equation something trivially correct such This strategy invalid because does not offer the guarantee that using correctly results proof For example QED The squaring step not reversible which why this doesn work Yet the strategy does not flag this problem you are thinking these terms try starting from and deducing Then you are using the valid strategy starting with something true and using legitimate mathematical operations which maintain truthfulness Look boundary cases what you are saying true for How about what about inf What about negative non integer Several problems this sort cropped question and will probably crop later problems well you see something like this you can ask about you can state that you are limiting your domain positive integer something like that far better limit the scope your proof than write something false Don skip steps can hard know how much detail you should put down but here some examples how reduce one equation another Too Little log log log Minimimally acceptable log Better log log base log Note that the first two examples have the same number lines However the first one had leap between the first two lines which would force the reader puzzle over for while general limit each new line one mathematical operation Try keep compact Part clarity compactness your proof starts meander and look more like essay try rewriting fewer sentences you can rewrite and still meanders perhaps you missing some key element Compactness not conflict with point long you remember that clarity the overall goal Either too much too little verbiage can detrimental Note About Inductive Proofs noticed that some people don use the correct base case Consider the statement the first problem Prove that log The base case not think perhaps since listed separately the description people may worried that the induction might not work that far But does that the whole point having the base case and listing separately the original description general try make the proofs encompassing possible Date Jan PST From Larry Ruzzo ruzzo quinault washington edu cse Subject expected time for insertion sort Andy poins out that part the answer page you seemingly have prove something about the expected case running time for insertion sort That correct but turns out that simple upper bound the worst case running time all you need this isn too hard other words unlike the quicksort part you NOT need

this class was being facetious Although the stress elegant algorithms with good theoretical analyses wouldn doing much good they their techniques weren also useful practice For most the algorithms

wbarrett wolf washington edu cse wolf washington edu Subject HOW BAD Really did bunch number crunching that calculator try figure out WHEN for what value the dazzlingly linear time SELECT algorithm REALLY does its job with fewer comparisons than simply sorting the elements and indexing the one you want Here the formula crunched For what value Here why One our recent homework problems suggested sorting algorithm that QuickSorted elements recursively until the size the subproblem was less than for some The inequality wrote above implicitly ASSUMES that for the value being tested will compare the sort the right with NON RECURSIVE version SELECT other words see pays off through the SELECT routine JUST ONCE submit that the smallest value that makes the above inequality true EXACTLY the crossover point counting the number comparisons which one should benefit from using the SELECT routine instead sorting all elements Details the formula Sort the baby groups each Sort the medians the groups Partition the elements about the Sort the group containing the median The comes from the fact that elements can sorted with comparisons giving comparisons fact the ceiling can dropped since the leftover elements always require less than comparisons sort HERE THE ANSWER somewhere around requires less comparisons use the SELECT algorithm than sort the whole array Better value anybody conclude that the selection problem should solved sorting and indexing calling SELECT Note that this method should the guide for recursive calls well the above correct then isn all bad thought actually COULD USE this algorithm beneficially for REASONABLY large However note that this analysis only compares the numbers comparisons used the two methods Relative differences the amount other work the algorithms need could shift the tradeoff point quite bit either direction think would great somebody the class would actually test this out Are FACT doing anything practically worthwhile here other

programming that optimal solution the problem can built out optimal solutions related smaller problems The smaller problems often arise fixing various ways some the choices that ultimately must made matrix parenthesization there was choice where the outermost parentheses and assuming they position certain subproblems arise You don know but can consider all possibilities the string edit problem you did for homework there choice the last edit operation used build the output string from the input string and assuming was say copy then certain subproblem arises assuming was twiddle different subproblem arises etc Again you don know which the right choice make for the last operation you consider them all LCS similar What are the choices Knapsack you fix one does give rise smaller knapsack like problem Which choice should you fix How many ways are there fix Can you tell what the right choice not can you consider all possibilities some systematic way you stuck always recommend playing with some examples Make some simple instances the problem with object what solution Vary how does the solution change Add another object etc There course some danger that your examples will too simple too specialized that you will leap the wrong conclusion from them but that what proofs are for and concrete examples often help crystalize your thinking cse geoduck Subject evaluations Friday Date Wed

these can constructed from and polynomial time and that has clique iff subgraph Forwarded Message Date Wed Mar From Larry Roske roske lynx washington edu Martin Tompa tompa washington edu cse geoduck washington edu Subject just kidding Will problems like those suggested for the final and would possible get solutions the suggested problems via Email Thanks Larry Thu Mar Martin Tompa wrote Here are some exercises Chapter help you study for the final You don need turn these End Forwarded Message cse geoduck Subject Date Wed Mar PST From Martin Tompa tompa geoduck washington edu Andy doesn quite have your graded you have look the solutions prepared you want see how solve them Hopefully you can pick your graded the exam tomorrow Sorry couldn get them back you sooner cse geoduck Subject Problem Date Wed Mar PST From Martin Tompa tompa geoduck washington edu that not really even simpler The input the problem consists the weights and values plus written binary Imagine that small and the weights and are large let forget about the values the objects for this discussion Now the size the input log since there are weights including itself each length most log But the running time which not polynomial log fact constant and allowed vary then exponential log because exponential log Forwarded Message Date Wed Mar tompa Subject Problem have question regarding input binary then exponential the length this binary encoding this because there are possible combinations items consider and therefore the capacity unrestricted could size that exponential End Forwarded Message Date Wed Mar PST From Eva Marie Allen eallen wolf washington edu Martin Tompa tompa geoduck washington edu says means ruzzo washington edu Algorithms cse washington edu Subject was wondering how much weight Completeness carried this final reading the material and could easily spend all night Eva Date Thu Mar From aberman hobbes Andrew Berman cse hobbes Subject place them box room tomorrow morning
