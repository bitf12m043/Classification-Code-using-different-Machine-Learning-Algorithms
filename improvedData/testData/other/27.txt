definitions were the same the book Well since hadn seen this material while needed back and look the book explaination before answering turns out that the definitions given the book are similar but not identical Big notation which used measure growth rates functions for some constants and for all This would mean that grows roughly like The definition for little for all constants there exists constant such that for all That for all constants the key difference between the two definitions Little doesn measure growth rates instead used indicate that one function this case dominated another function you don see the difference consider that for all all functions grow similarly themselves but function dominates itself this isn immediately clear you try prove and remember the definition

assignment little bit vague handled most errors fairly brute but working manner Sometimes however the error message given has with the stack being empty though clearly the user has entered bad input sufficient report that the stack empty the user For example when enter the input clearly invalid but because how the infix postfix algorithm works the stack indicated empty Here the guideline going use your program dumps core you didn handle error gracefully For those not familiar with Unix core dump occurs when your program executes invalid instruction you try execute your data when you have invalid memory reference usually caused mucking with NULL pointers long you print out some message indicating that error occured and tell the truth don care the message says Invalid operator Attempted

wrote his own solution and the process uncovered some issues that had left ambiguous the problem statement Here are some those clarifications Thanks Brian Displaying your Huffman tree this isn required for what you turn but for your own debugging purposes you might want import your tree display function and use check whether the Huffman tree you building correct When there are ties such which child make left and which make right you can resolve them however you like Streams the problem statement talks about using character streams for the decoded string and bit streams for the encoded string inputs and outputs Character streams are easy you can just use the standard streams reading characters from the keyboard and displaying characters the screen Bit streams are slightly more complicated Since the whole point encoding compress characters would make sense your TreeEncode function outputs the chars and since this would use bits for each bit the encoding Brian working package that will handle the bit streams for you and will broadcast when ready the meantime for debugging purposes just use stream and chars described above and standard cse geoduck Subject format the frequency file Date Tue Dec PST From Martin Tompa tompa geoduck washington edu Another clarification courtesy Brian didn specify what format you should use for your file character frequency pairs you When you your electronic turn you will also turn this frequency file whatever format you decide However your program must read the characters and frequencies from file because practice these frequencies might changed later the set characters might changed For this assignment you may assume that there will never more than characters and the file you will set will just contain the

Mon Dec From Jason Aten aten washington edu Brian Dewey dewey washington edu cse washington edu Subject Sample input Brian appear getting the ball park but still substantially different compression length numbers mostly believe because tree probably built little differently that yours Sometimes smaller compression sometimes larger How know doing correctly Perhpaps can compare the length all the letters this scheme get length for abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz should the same for everyone yes End Forwarded Message first this looked obvious that everyone should get the encoding length the string abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz tried prove and instead found counterexample Let this lesson all about the importance proving obvious things First all let clarify for everyone what the issue Why are people getting somewhat different encoding lengths for the same string Everyone using the same algorithm right The answer that the encoding length can depend how your tree building algorithm breaks ties Here the counterexample for smaller alphabet Suppose you have the following alphabet and corresponding frequencies You must start making and siblings but then you have choice since this point you have trees each with weight Here are two possible encoding trees you could end with Now you ask for the encoding length abcd the first case you get and the second case you get What going here Huffman algorithm supposed produce the optimal encoding tree why are getting suboptimal encoding one case The answer that our sample string abcd doesn have the frequencies were promised when built the tree Notice that the string abccdd which has the promised frequencies has encoding length both cases Unfortunately get the correct frequencies for letter alphabet would take very long test string cse

number compressed bits significantly different than what getting you probably doing something wrong close then you good shape What close Can you give range this moment see Martin earlier mail for the theoretical reasons The practical reason that there always chance that there subtle flaw program tough sure that any program longer than dozen lines totally correct not going treat test results gospel Now fairly sure the answers get not optimal are the ballpark your answers are the ballpark answers least know playing the same game This the bottom line correct implementation for the purposes this assignment one that uses the algorithms discussed the book can encode strings and when decodes bitstream always produces the original input incorrect program will have flaw somewhere its implementation the algorithms Here are possible clues that there flaw your program You are unable decode bitstream you get gibberish You can properly decode any bitstream but the encoding lengths are way off from the samples that have been flying around this mailing list Not only data but other students well This probably means that you built encoding tree but you were not picking the subtrees with the minimum frequency each step Notice that only possible symptom problem may some cases you generate shorter encodings than the samples you seen and some cases longer You will not lose points
