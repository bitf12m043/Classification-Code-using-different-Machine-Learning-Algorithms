two great books about how about presenting your data graphical form intelligently anyone who written paper given talk with graph should own least the first volume talked about lot material that you could glean from his books but also gave some tips public speaking heard some this before from other sources but always good get refresher course Show early you can fix any mechanical problems that might arise lights water someone else has the room etc you can mingle with your audience How start Tell the audience What the problem Who cares What are you going about The stumble bum method high risk approach Tufte described talk given humble high school math teacher lecture hall full mathematics professors his first slide the math teacher had simple proof with error the third line Naturally the professors leaned forward their chairs point out the flaw For the rest the presentation the audience hung every word waiting for the next slip course there was slip Caution you use this technique you had better know your stuff When explaining complex figure follow the Particular General Particular principle Particular use example explain what the numbers mean General explain the overall structure the figure Particular return example reinforce the interpretation the figure Speak from notes don read prepared text Use handouts Handouts can convey far more information than can represented overhead slide Handouts give your audience opportunity engaged your material rather than being passive When their attention drifts they can read ahead your handouts and find the part that interests them noticed that the affiliates when bored would leave through whatever material they had hand the program for the next session for example they had preview what you were going say next they might more motivated pay attention Your audience can think lot faster than you can talk you should give them material think about Handouts can provide depth material omitted from your talk that will interest the specialists the audience Handouts leave permanent record when the audience goes home rather than allowing your talk disappear without trace This lends sense having faith your topic and your work Information content should match the level that you would find the NYT WSJ Your audience didn suddenly become dumber when they walked into the room hear you talk Plus familiarity with presentation style helps them focus what you talking about Avoid overheads overhead can convey only fraction the information content printed material your slides are just misshapen trapezoidal note cards for your benefit why not speak from note cards you want give the audience something pay attention when you saying give them handouts Tufte did concede that overheads are useful for color images that would impractical hand out but the information content most color overheads pretty low unless photograph artistic reproduction Never apologize Don explain how nervous you are and what the probability that you throw midway through the presentation Unless you call attention yourself your audience will much more concerned about their own physical and emotional state than yours Use humor that point Don unnecessarily offend part your audience with humor that irrelevant your topic Avoid using masculine pronouns refer universal alternate examples with and she use they This another method avoid alienating people Work hard prepare practice for critical audience practice for videtape spot flaws and mannerisms and idiosyncrasies addition developing notes for your content develop metanotes remind you make eye contact not mumble not play pocket pool drink your water etc Innovate Don trapped the conventional forms the presentation creative find ways take the presentation beyond linear presentation facts and instead make become something like dialogue with your colleagues Dealing with questions People opinion your work may well depend more the way you answer questions than the content quality your presentation Often the person who asking wants know What about How does you work solve problem don humiliate embarass your questioner you anticipate aggressive interruptions establish ground rules say that take minutes for you present the basic material and then there will plenty time for discussion Having established the rule when the unnamed interrupter speaks remind the rule and say minutes more you worried that you won get any questions that you won get asked the crucial question get confederate the audience ask the question patient after you finish speaking you probably get question before you can count Show your enthusiasm Don hide behind lectern Use gestures Walk around directly engaging audience members attention Tufte did this remarkably effectively Finish early Everyone will happier Tufte asked How often have you heard some colleagues walking down the hall saying That talk was great just wish they gone for another minutes Avoid dehydration Make sure you drink enough water during the talk Make your responsibility make sure you have water Avoid dehydrating beverages caffeine and alcohol The two most dehydrating things you can are travel airplane and speak public you fly Atlanta give talk you need compensate Finally throughout the class Tufte reminded Respect your audience Treat them colleagues who are interested helping you solve
