designing building and presenting team project midterm examination final examination Readings Brooks The Mythical Man Month MMM Ghezzi Jazayeri and Mandrioli GJM Fundamentals Software Engineering You may use other similar books see Notkin for details There also lot this and other handouts expect you read them carefully ExamsThe examinations are tentatively scheduled given Monday February class and the regularly scheduled final Monday March The midterm examination will cover material and including design The second examination will comprehensive Grading Your contribution the project will account for about your total grade The midterm will account for about your grade and the final will account for another Intangibles such class participation may affect your grade well Your project grade will based the quality your work not just your effort You not the project will graded individuals group generally receive different grades Final evaluation the group projects done demonstration the project group discussion the project and the process building and separate discussions with each individual group member This time consuming process that will take place Tuesday March and Wednesday March Plan accordingly LecturesMost the lectures will cover topics such the software lifecycle characteristics large systems software specification software design techniques development tools testing verification and validation maintenance etc much possible lectures will coordinated with associated stages the project There may two three invited lecturers giving their impression software engineering and the problems with software engineering various companies The following chart shows the tentative schedule for lectures exams etc subject frequent change Week Monday Wednesday Friday class Overview Overview Lifecycle Lifecycle Requirements Requirements class Design Design Design Design Design Testing Testing Testing Midterm Formal Methods Formal Methods Inspections Environments Environments class Safety Reliability Architecture Process Metrics TBA TBA TBA SectionsSections will used variety ways including group meetings both among yourselves and also with the and presentations groups other groups etc Project RequirementsLarge scale software projects require teams designers implementors and support staff Because this the construction these projects demands not only technical abilities but also skills group dynamics give you some experience with these dynamics you will form groups four six people specify the requirements design and implement the assigned project described below You must produce your system according the schedule that will handed out Friday The schedule includes several milestones each represented specific artifact preview the draft the requirements specification document the first milestone will due Wednesday January not necessary that every group member involved meeting each milestone For instance person charge testing the complex system may not need understand the low level implementation choices However you are required state explicitly who has been involved each milestone and what capacity recommend strongly that each document written single person with editing help from the others will provide additional information timely basis about what expect from each artifact the document describing requirements specifications will handed out Wednesday not have full set high quality artifacts for similar project This would nice but surprisingly difficult acquire Sticking the schedule for each artifact essential that you can complete the entire project during the quarter for some reason the schedule does not meet the needs your group will consider alternatives careful reasoned motivations are given Don plan working just one milestone time you must always have least part your team looking ahead towards milestones that are coming The project description intentionally under defined group you will responsible for making decisions about the user interface the data structures and forth One goal the milestones help your group make these decisions orderly manner Feel free ask questions about what expected The and will try answer these questions were your customers although with some special knowledge about the constraints one quarter course Some other details include Every team must select name Every team must take and keep minutes all your meetings The motivation for the minutes that you may otherwise forget decisions that you made which costly terms time and energy not spend time formatting these handwritten minutes are just fine They should copied and distributed all appropriate group members Bring extra copy these minutes every Tuesday during section scan these see how your team progressing and will keep them for our records Every individual must keep personal log The logs will checked occasion sections They are intended help both you and keep track where your time going The log which not very different from time sheets that many employers require you complete includes the date the description the activity the time took and some explanatory text The following sample you may select different categories but consistent with the minutes don format these You may find that keeping them bound notebook effective Bring these Tuesday sections also want have them turned the end the quarter Here example few entries from personal log Date Category Time Hours Notes Sep Lecture Notkin intro Oct Project Planning Jane Biff join group Oct Lecture Intro continued Didn follow word Oct Reading MMM Chaps Better than said Oct Future Read Silver Bullet Oct Lecture Basic life cycle Oct Reading Finished MMM Note that some the entries are essentially instantaneous forming your group may may note like this and need not have times attached Others are prescriptions for later things either during even after the course You may have categories later the course for group meetings planning editing debugging etc The development language you will use either Ada some cases given good motivation might grant permission for group use alternative language But case will permit group use language for which all group members who will programming not have expertise there too much this quarter add the burden learning another programming language Your group must communicate well addition selecting management structure recommend that you decide firm times for group and subgroup meetings You may wish distinguish among status updates brainstorming meetings decision making meetings etc Your group may lose member for various reasons this happens you will expected close ranks and adjust the problem Losing personnel does happen the real world and another motivation for carefully documenting each step along the project path Because software development less predictable than desirable you should plan from the beginning for reasonable subsets the system Computer resources always seem the most precious when they are needed the most The real world different from academia this respect machines are often loaded unavailable critical times You have been warned People projects make mistakes They don save their files before crash they inadvertently delete key directories careful and try develop managerial technical approaches for reducing this kind error Similarly you need approaches for helping your group keep track multiple versions artifacts including code This course time consuming make sure use your time well Don stare off into space while program compiling Don draw complex figures using computer quick sketch hand sufficient Don debug just permuting the statements your program Project DescriptionCheck the Project Description for
