Date Tue Dec GMT Server NCSA Content type text html CSE ProjectsCSE Information about ProjectsPurpose The project your opportunity practice design and implementation solution problem using data structures and algorithms more realistic context than the preceding assignments have afforded Not only can you experience the problem solving process through more complete sequence but you also can choose your topic from variety choice options Unlike the assignments far you are asked work groups two people with the possible exception that those working the OPSIS topic below might asked work separately working together with partner you will able communicate with another person you solve your problem together every student worked alone totally different project there could tendency for you become isolated and easily get stuck with technical problems that nobody else could help you with The project will involve not only analysis and implementation but reporting both written and oral forms This much like what software development team has corporate environment when they are part effort custom software project new product plan the data structures and algorithms will key part your project but not the only part TopicsApplying graph algorithms WWW URL data This could include taking bunch WWW documents computing some basic features them like number words links images headings etc obtain feature vector for each document and then considering the complete graph these documents with weight edge representing the distance between its two documents Then minimum spanning tree could constructed order identify clusters similar documents Using tree and graph data structures represent and manipulate images maps Possibilities include implementing pyramids multiresolution representations images implementing sets chain codes represent roads political boundaries rivers and other linear features maps Here some additional information pyramids and quadtrees Implementing and comparing various types binary search trees such splay trees AVL trees etc using the OPSIS visual programming system for data structures Students selecting this option will not need write large program any other traditional language but will most their work with powerful new visual editor for data structure algorithms Here more information OPSIS Processing symbolic expressions Linked lists are particularly useful representing symbolic expressions such mathematical formulas parts computer programs and representations knowledge for artificial intelligence systems their core interpreters for language such Lisp and Mathematica are list processing systems Students selecting this option will either design their own list oriented language and implement choose small subset Lisp Mathematica similar language and implement that Project MilestonesWednesday November Topic descriptions due You should have chosen partner unless you are doing the OPSIS option and topic this time Your description should include both partners names title for the project paragraph explaining your topic and what you hope accomplish should also explain how you and your partner plan divide the work Who will what Explain which computing platform you plan use List one two references you have found that will help you your project How will the user interact with your program Between Monday November and Wednesday November Small group meetings with discuss your projects and any difficulties you may having Here the current schedule December Project presentations December Written reports due Late policy for project milestones Topic descriptions received after the due date will have taken off Teams that not meet with December will have taken off the whole project grade Project reports turned after Dec but Dec will docked the project grade and there will another off for each business day the report late Turning Monday Dec means off the project grade Tuesday Dec off and the final exam off turned after the final exam credit will given for projects Last update November Tanimoto
