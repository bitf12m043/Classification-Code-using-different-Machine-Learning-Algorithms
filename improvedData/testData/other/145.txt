After completing this lab you will know how use the oscilloscope and logic analyzer test and debug sequential circuits You should divide into groups two complete this lab assignment Digital Oscilloscope and Switch Debouncing The digital oscilloscope lets you examine the detailed behavior signals function time You will examine the output the clock generator provided your DesignKit You will also observe switch bounce and learn how measure propagation delay The Oscilloscope Oscilloscopes display voltage waveforms function time much the same way that simulator displays signal waveforms The scopes that you will using are part the Tektronix logic analyzers These scopes can sample two signals and display their waveforms either separately simultaneously Each signal sampled some rate MHz every and this sampled signal displayed according commands that you enter into the logic analyzer Oscilloscopes sample the voltage the signal and display its value each sample time Logic analyzers work similarly except that they only sample and values The hard part operating the scope indicating how you want the signal sampled and how you want displayed This lab assignment will try show you how both The Tek Logic Analyzer Digital Oscilloscope The Tektronix logic analyzer console has video monitor the left side the console Buttons and ribbon cable connectors are the right side Because the uses menus the monitor control operation few controls are needed the console However the menus and commands can confusing The logic analyzers with digital scope boards have BNC connectors the rear panel for scope and trigger input Probes are attached the BNC connectors make measurements These probes provide extra impedance the circuit minimize disturbance the circuit After the logic analyzer powered using the switch located the rear panel will eventually display opening screen Press the MENU key start operation The figure the top the next page road map for using the oscilloscope that shows what commands are available the different modes You will find helpful refer this figure you read the rest the lab assignment The main menu divided into three sections SETUP DATA and UTILITIES Only two these menus are used access the scope capabilities the system The menu selection marked Digital Scope the DATA section used display waveforms The menu selection marked Digital Scope the SETUP section used change setup parameters the oscilloscope that determine how the signals are sampled Notice the menu bar the bottom the screen The menu bar simply provides reminder the commands available Commands are always issued pressing key and not through the menu command does not need visible the menu bar for you perform that command using the keypad The menu bar assists you remembering which functions are available from which menus and modes there are too many commands then pressing the key will rotate through multiple menu bars The NOTES key used display line help about the available commands and options screen reference material will displayed the screen when you press the NOTES key The arrow keys are used move the cursors around the screen some cases the cursor highlighted selection that can moved from one item another The value highlighted selection changed either using the and rotate through the available alternatives entering the proper value using the keypad Using the Oscilloscope Examine Your Clock Generator Find the BNC connector marked SCOPE INPUT the rear the console and connect oscilloscope probe Connect the tip the probe the output your clock generator Remember that your clock generator output open collector you will need pull resistor Connect the black grounding wire the ground your Protoboard The DATA DIGITAL SCOPE screen Before you start make sure you are starting with the default setup pressing NOTES and ENTER simultaneously Now press MENU obtain the logic analyzer main menu Press the logic analyzer keypad the Digital Scope Display screen You see window which displays signal waveforms and list parameters the left side the screen This screen functions two modes One mode brings reverse video cursor which allows you change some the setup parameters listed the left side the screen the other mode the reverse video cursor not present but you can change other parameters commands accessed via keypad Selecting Channel The CHANNEL field indicates which channel being displayed change this setting press the and keys Set the oscilloscope display channel You should see the clock waveform the screen Changing the Setup Enter the change setup mode pressing the DON CARE key reverse video cursor will appear Use the cursor keys move the cursor You see that you can change the ATTENUATOR POSITION and TIMEBASE fields Use the arrow keys move the cursor and the and keys change the values Attenuator The ATTENUATOR field used set the vertical scale the display That you select the number volts per grid square that your waveform fits the display Set the attenuator per square Position The POSITION field indicates the vertical displacement used displaying the waveform adjusting this parameter you can shift the waveform down Using the attenuator and position together you can view any part the waveform any detail Timebase TIMEBASE used set the horizontal scale the display that how often your signal sampled This parameter usually set that enough the signal captured For example changing this parameter you can choose how many periods periodic waveform are displayed the screen Change these three parameters until you get easy read trace your clock signal Change the frequency your clock signal Observe how this changes your trace retain your changes you must press the ENTER key after you have finished adjusting parameters you press the DON CARE key leave the change setup mode your changes will discarded Controlling the Display Now that you have determined how you want sample the signal there are several commands that change how displayed Zoom out Note the bar graph display above the scope display This graph indicates what part the waveform being displayed the screen You can press the and keys change the resolution the display effect the horizontal scale the trace expands contracts Decreasing the number samples displayed the screen allows you examine waveform more detail Scanning the Trace and taking Measurements Note the cursor the trace display You can move this cursor left and right using the arrow keys you move the cursor the cursor position displayed that you can measure the time from one point the trace another This measurement made even easier the ability place reference cursor using the ENTER key This establishes that location reference point the reference point will marked with dashed line Then move the cursor the second point The delta values will displayed the screen display The cursor can changed horizontal cursor using the key This useful for measuring the voltages Taking Measurements with Grid You can take approximate measurements from this screen superimposing grid the screen Press toggle the grid and off Although this allows you read values directly from the screen these measurements are necessarily quite approximate Precise measurements are better taken using the cursors Using the SETUP DIGITAL SCOPE screen Not all the scope sampling settings are accessible from the Change Setup part the DATA DIGITAL SCOPE screen Press MENU and then obtain the SETUP DIGITAL SCOPE screen and examine the other scope settings Use the arrow keys move the reverse video cursor around the screen You can change the values the parameters pressing the and keys Some the settings this screen are also accessible from the Change Setup screen Coupling Coupling toggles between and The stands for direct coupling used display all frequency components signal you want use the scope simple voltmeter sure the input coupled filters the direct component the signal that only the alternating component the signal displayed This setting can used examine small alternating signal that superimposed large voltage will typically use the setting Triggering Triggering determines when the scope samples the signal free triggering mode the scope starts sampling new trace soon the previous trace finished being captured This means that the position edges periodic signal will placed randomly depending when the scope starts sampling the signal Free triggering useful get continuous monitor signal but not used all that much Set the triggering FREE Notice that the waveform seems move redrawn because the transitions are not redrawn the same places you want freeze the image press STOP Press START resume sampling Continuous triggering mode CONT like free triggering except that synchronizing signal used determine when start sampling signal This signal determined the parameters called SOURCE COUPLING SLOPE and LEVEL The SOURCE the triggering signal typically the signal being sampled although can come from external source COUPLING here means the same thing for the signal itself will typically use coupling The trigger defined some edge the signal you are observing You indicate whether you want trigger the rising falling edge using the SLOPE parameter You indicate what point the edge you want trigger specifying the voltage LEVEL Change the triggering mode CONT and observe the waveform again The waveform should stable now This possible because continuous triggering uses the trigger signal start sampling the same point the waveform each time the signal not stable then you must adjust the trigger parameters described above The final parameter POSITION specifies where the triggering event displayed the screen changing this parameter you can examine events before after the triggering event Switch Debouncing and Single Traces Since this digital storage scope you can sample single trace and examine your leisure This SINGLE triggering mode First setup the trigger and then press START This will cause just one sampling take place when the first trigger event detected Use this display the bounce your push button switch connected below Connect the oscilloscope the output depress the pushbutton and capture the waveform showing what happens the switch closed Note you will need set trigger for the oscilloscope You will notice that the output does not make clean transition but bounces around bit How long does the bounce last Repeat the experiment several times Also repeat the experiment observing the output when the pushbutton released You will need change the trigger setting will now debounce the pushbutton debounce this type switch single pole single throw SPST will require special analog circuit consisting resistor capacitor and Schmitt trigger your You already have resistor connected The circuit should configured When the button depressed the capacitor shorted ground and quickly discharged This makes the output the Schmitt trigger inverter immediately high the button momentarily disconnects the capacitor will start recharging but only slowly due the large time constant the time constant longer than the bounce time there won time charge the capacitor enough trip the Schmitt trigger and the output will stay high The internal hysteresis the Schmitt trigger will prevent from switching again until the input gets very high Once the pushbutton released there will enough time and the capacitor will eventually charge and the output the Schmitt triggers will low The and values should chosen that times more than times the duration the longest bounce the previous experiment Also should not larger than kiloohms the will not work correctly its input will sink more current than being provided through Compare the waveforms the pushbutton output before and after you add the debouncing circuit Measuring Propagation Delay Propagation delay the time for change the input gate reflected the output Propagation delays are measured from the points the transitions the points the transition that are halfway between the high and low values the waveform For inverter can define two propagation times tphl the transition time for rising transition propagated and tplh the time for falling transition propagated will measure the delay one the inverters your kit connecting the clock generator one input and comparing the output the inverter shown above Unfortunately the scope boards not permit superimpose two traces the same display Therefore the procedure for making these measurements somewhat complicated Connect another scope probe channel two your scope Use one channel the scope examine the clock signal and the other channel examine the signal coming out the chip make the comparison honest you should load the output with TTL input another inverter will for this Are the propagation delays within the range you expected Does the delay change the fanout the inverter increased Dual Screen Mode From the scope display screen press into dual screen mode The dual screen mode works like the single screen mode you used before except that two traces are displayed You can only access one half the screen time toggle between the upper and lower halves the screen press the key The grid overlay you obtained pressing disabled this mode Adjust the parameters the two traces until you can see the signal going into the inverter and the signal coming out the inverter take measurements between these screens you must ensure that the signals are comparable both traces must have the same timebases and zoom factor You have already learned how adjust the timebases ensure that both traces trigger from the same source the scope setup menu Adjust the triggering parameters that both waveforms are continuous trigger mode with the same triggering parameters You can use the key copy parameter from one channel another Channel one should have INT the triggering source Channel two should have its triggering source that they both start sampling precisely the same time Return the scope display and examine the displays Adjust the timebase parameters and necessary your clock generator obtain traces from which you can accurately measure propagation delay Use the cursor and reference cursors measure the delay from one signal the other Make sure the that the zoom factor identical for both traces and that the horizontal trace position identical Hand Due May the frequencies you observed the oscilloscope match the setting your clock generator How far off are they How long does the bounce your push button switch last How many edges are there average Does the debouncing circuit eliminate the bounce What the delay signal through inverter what you expected given the information the data sheets Logic Analyzer Debugging sequential circuits much more difficult than debugging purely combinational circuits Logic analyzers sample and collect data and display the waveforms their screen This will enable you observe the behavior your circuit during entire time interval rather than just one point time possible with your probe the lab there documentation that describes the operation the Tektronix logic analyzer You may find using this logic analyzer confusing first suggest you read carefully pages section which covers general information about using the logic analyzer You should also read the rest this section but some the information will not make sense until you actually try use the logic analyzer The next step try out the logic analyzer using the exercises from section the documentation The best way learn try things out and ask questions you don understand something Section contains two exercises which rely test card available the lab that contains simple counter circuit The first exercise covers asynchronous operation which uses free running internal clock sample data With this type sampling the logic analyzer will not generate crisp waveform and you need oversample multiple samples per clock edge order get evenly spaced transitions signals The second exercise covers synchronous operation which uses clock that you supply sample data This makes sense when you want see the value signals precisely the active edge the system clock and not deal with the jitter typically seen asynchronous operation sampling more wisely you able avoid oversampling and collect longer history into the logic analyzer memory After you have done these two exercises use the logic analyzer observe your bit counter from the previous lab assignment using the pushbutton switch generate the clock signal Connect leads the logic analyzer the switch controlling the counter and all its outputs Have the analyzer trigger transition the debounced switch Then again without the debounce circuitry with switch you know bounces and see you get waveform that shows the counter counting more than one for single bouncy switch press Lastly try triggering counter value making sure collect some data before the trigger that you can see the switch event that caused the counter advance Hand Due optionDemonstrate your mastery the logic analyzer the using the counter circuit Your should sign your turn sheet from Part show
