Nitin Sharma Subject question regarding homework dewey june Brian Dewey cse june Date Thu Oct PDT From Brian Dewey dewey scoter washington edu obviously misinterpreting the third problem homework one because under interpretation the answer trivial Here the way read the question Let the set all NFAs with states must find function such that NFA has equivalent DFA containing fewer than states that the case isn trivial show that one can construct NFA with states that accepts sigma star states fully connected all states are final And that state NFA has equivalent DFA with one state Thus Not quite The problem doesn ask you find NFA has equivalent DFA containing fewer than states You are asked find there some state NFA which has equivalent DFA with fewer than states And you have find the largest such function the answer satisfies the first condition but not the largest such function Also since Pumping lemma has not been covered yet and the hint suggests using idea like the proof Pumping lemma makes sense extend the deadline bit NOT DUE BEFORE Thursday Oct nitin From nitin june Nitin Sharma Subject homework cse june Date Sun Oct PDT Some you had asked about what lemmas and theorems referred problems and actually are Lemma referred problem contains the proof for showing the construction NFAs for regular expressions has NFA for epsilon iii phi and Lemma contains the construction Reg Exprs for Uses Kleene approach Compute Rij Rij Rik Rkk Rkj for all Union gives the desired expression Thm shows the equivalence DFA and NFA using Subset Construction Since Sipser text not out yet Hopcroft Ulman text good substitute for these topics the Sipser treatment quite similar some you still find any problem let know can get you copies the relevant sections the text nitin From nitin june Nitin Sharma Subject homework ambrose washington edu Bret Ambrose Date Sun Oct PDT cse june Problem improperly parenthesized Depending where you put the needed parantheses you get two different expressions How should interpret this Thanks for pointing this out should read nitin Date Mon Oct PDT From Yee Yeung kayee washington edu Nitin Sharma nitin washington edu cse washington edu Subject homework Hey

Badros Date Wed Oct PDT cse june paraphrase the other question about the question posed the too must missing something obvious because think the family NFA the question mentions nth character from end state NFA which can reduced DFA fewer than states can big possibly could that requires proof course But that will prove and not But not clear least that states bound can proven for this example careful with constant factors think slightly lower bound could proven but even that not trivial Note that you have prove that DFA with states can accept this set nth symbol from the right you find tough come with high lower bound you can nitin cse Subject Subset construction optimality RAA june washington edu Date Wed Oct PDT From Brian Dewey dewey scoter washington edu throw own two cents paraphrase the other question about the question posed the too must missing something obvious because think the family NFA the question mentions nth character from end state NFA which can reduced DFA fewer than states can big possibly could that Actually isn the character from the end set languages set that requires states NFA but states DFA requires proof course But that will prove and not little perplexed what you mean that last sentence think slightly lower bound could proven but even that not trivial certainly hope slightly lower bound can proven that what attempting Blatant advertisement for collaboration who been working this problem and making headway love bounce ideas off someone late tonight sometime tomorrow Date Wed Oct PDT From Greg Badros gjb washington edu Brian Dewey dewey

missing something obvious because think the family NFA the question mentions nth character from end state NFA which can reduced DFA fewer than states can big possibly could that mistyped here Actually isn the character from the end set languages set that requires states NFA but states DFA seems like the last character from the end would require only states think you right Computational complexity theory sure encourages off one errors requires proof course But that will prove and not little perplexed what you mean that last sentence just mistyped instead was correcting mistake Good luck with
