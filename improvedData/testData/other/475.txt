Singapore These are just some observations the first country other than the where stayed for significant amount time Weather hot was every day was there until rained just before left And when rains rains heavily The drains Singapore streets are deep trenches both sides the road rather than small openings underground sewer The trench drains lead network canals that carry the rain water back the ocean wonder why the canals don channel the water into the reservoirs Singapore must buy most its fresh water from Malaysia Even with such drain system floods can still occur during the monsoon season fall Other than the amount rain there way distinguish the seasons tropical Singapore Fauna The plant life totally different There are many colorful flowers The most common trees are rain trees which line most roads and palm trees saw many wild banana trees too wild ones apparently don bear fruit The most common bird the mynah which only see zoos the Geckos crawl around inside the houses the ceiling and walls Architecture There are many tall buildings Singapore more densely populated city than Seattle Los Angeles Chicago Houston have never been New York City can compare with Singapore Most new development the form high rise buildings Apartment buildings are about ten thirty stories and are painted several bright colors have never seen buildings painted many colors the told that part the reason for this that illiterate tenants can recognize their own buildings The buildings are made steel and concrete There are few wooden buildings With concrete ceilings and walls and marble floors the houses not retain odors and are cooler than they otherwise would Because the warm weather some windows have glass only metalwork Many buildings have small steps only couple inches high odd places tripped over many these Literally everywhere you look construction and consequently noise and dust are problems Singapore Appliances Light switches are placed higher and closer the edges walls than the The switches are also smaller There are switches for electric outlets and water heaters well water heater Singapore small box that heats small stream water passes through Many places not have hot water Because the year round heat isn needed much the Most toilets are the old fashioned squat type Showers are the corners the bathrooms with stalls saw bathtubs except hotels Many people wash clothes hand saw dishwashers Refrigerators are rotary whatever that means They have small freezer compartment the top like most fridges here and equal sized main compartment There are also two drawers the bottom that open from the outside the unit rather than from the inside Air conditioners are called aircon units and most are made Sanyo The units are four five feet long and little more than foot high They are installed interior walls near the ceiling Many people not use air conditioning their homes because they think the air somehow artificial bad All malls and restaurants are air conditioned All lights are fluorescent Transportation Japanese and European cars are the most common types Singapore don remember seeing any American made automobiles The models are different too For example saw Toyota Tercels Celicas but they had models called the Crown and Corona Cars are very expensive largely because tax automobiles One must also buy permits enter various areas the city during peak hours For these reasons most people not own cars Those who drive swerve and out their lanes seemingly not conscious the lines painted the pavement Taxis are very common and convenient took taxis almost everywhere Taxis are much cheaper than the The minimum fare the exchange rate was about Our average fare for the whole trip was about During the first week spent per day taxi fares Charmaine was averse walking the Singapore heat mostly commuted taxi Whenever went out alone took the MRT Singapore rail system Outside the city elevated Downtown underground very convenient and cheap has stops within mile just about anywhere you would want within the city The trains and stations are very clean all Singapore Actually the law banning public use chewing gum was passed because kids had stuck gum all over MRT stations including the doors causing them jam took buses few times Singapore has couple competing bus services service was good Rickshaws are still commonplace less busy city streets They longer travel some streets because many rickshaws were hit Singapore reckless drivers Charmaine mother takes rickshaws the market Shopping and Restaurants Singaporeans like shop There are malls everywhere Most shops are registered being private limited PTE LTD can seen most store fronts which reduces their liability some way One must still haggle some shops but that isn common used Supermarkets are just breaking into the scene didn see any while was there but did see commercial for Food Lion saw one mini supermarket shopping mall Most Singaporeans shop very frequently even daily wet markets where they can buy live seafood and chickens They like their food fresh Most Singaporeans not even take leftovers home from restaurants saw also few specialty shops that only sold different kinds dried fish only different types bananas never knew there were many different types bananas Some old men can still found pushing small carts selling sandwiches but they are rare Hawker centers are very popular and very cheap Hawker centers are like food courts They are called hawker centers because the proprietors individual stalls used attempt harass people into buying their food Thankfully this practice now banned and only practiced few the older hawker centers Usually there one shop the center that sells only drinks Hawker stalls not supply napkins you have remember take your own possible get good meal Singapore for couple dollars Many people eat out rather than cook because isn significantly more expensive There are more malls restaurants and hawker centers Singapore than you can imagine Practically every office building has mall its first few levels Practically every mall has few restaurants and hawker center CuisineMore than the population Chinese There are also significant numbers Malaysians and Indians Singaporean cuisine blend the cooking styles these cultures but prodominantly Chinese The Paranakans have completely blended the Chinese and Malaysian cultures and cuisines didn get around trying their food when was Singapore unfortunately Authentic Chinese cooking fairly greasy and salty with heavy emphasis meat especially prawns pork and fish Dried shrimp and fish are also commonly used and course various types tofu Popular foods for breakfast include dim sum Chinese mostly meat small wrappers buns laksa Malaysian curry soup mee siam Malaysian spicy noodles nasi lemak rice egg dried fish peanuts and chili paste wrapped banana leaf and roti prata Indian fried bread with curry had boiled pigeon eggs few times too Other popular dishes include chee cheong fun char kway teow claypot rice chicken rice wan tan noodles Hor Fun and satay tried all these foods and also ate squid several times jellyfish and sea cucumber Papaya starfruit and durian are popular fruits Durian considered the king fruits and very expensive Like most foreigners can stand the smell durian also has bad aftertaste Desserts are mostly coconut based agar coconut milk coconut water didn like any them KFC the most popular fast food chain and practically ubiquitous Burger King and McDonalds are also relatively common Genuine Korean Japanese Thai and Indonesian food popular and easily obtainable Fresh milk rare and expensive Most people drink sweetened condensed milk when they drink milk all Beef also seldom eaten Charmaine mother never cooked anything with beef while were there Media Limited censored cable television available but they not have satellite services Four government censored stations are broadcast different languages Malay Mandarin English and Tamil couple Indonesian stations can picked some parts Singapore Movies are heavily censored rather inelegant way They have similar rating system but all movies are rated even those rated here after being heavily cut European movies are less censored than ones Singapore provides modern telecommunications services but Internet service very expensive and restricted once tried connect the but was unable reach any machines here the other hand they have interactive Right now you can select news stories from menu and read them your Next year there should government information shopping and video demand services There only one paper published Singapore The Straits Times controlled the government The paper viewpoint very different from common opinion the some issues William
