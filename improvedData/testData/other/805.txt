Date Tue Dec GMT Server NCSA Content type text html The Image Warper The Image WarperComputer Science Engineering Department University Washington Seattle USA The Image Warper program for Windows that supports exploratory learning and enjoyable activities involving geometric transformations and image distortion The mathematics involved the activity richer and more complicated than that the Pixel Calculator the same time the mathematics somewhat more hidden from the student and needs brought out through structured activities and teacher initiated discussions about translation rotation axis stretching and invertibility transformations The Image Warper uses transformation method developed programmers Pacific Data Images Inc reported the SIGGRAPH Conference Proceedings and used produce well known Michael Jackson video that includes morphing sequences This algorithm permits user specification geometric transformations drawing set line segments and moving them indicate desired changes particular parts the image Simple transformations such rotation translation scaling can specified with single line segmentss Users can create more complicated transformations using two more control segments time Students quickly realize that each control segment has global effect but that anchor lines can help limit that effect Here picture the Image Warper user interface The interface includes status bar which displays the current location the cursor well the location length and angle the last selected control line This information can used activities designed teach coordinate systems angles and geometry Here how you can order your very own copy the Image Warper software bricker washington edu tanimoto washington edu Last modified Wed Mar PST
