Digital Design Laboratory Sieg You may also use the workstations the Pentium lab after the design tools are installed There are Intel Pentium workstation workbenches the lab There are also number other PCs and Macs which will not using much all The logic analyzers and digital oscilloscopes you will using are approximately one half the benches addition there also DataI PLD and microcontroller programmer Multi meters oscilloscopes and other tools and equipment are available Rules There will absolutely food drink brought into the lab and you should refrain from activities that disrupt fellow students Please help keep the lab clean and neat with equipment manuals and tools their proper place you are going gone from the Lab for any length time please clear your working space someone else

times CSE Tuesday CSE Thursday CSE Wednesday and Friday You will asked vacate bench others are available for those students All other times are available all students with simple limit hours per sitting student already bench for hours will need vacate and take turn the end the line This restriction will only put place things get really crowded Computer Aided Design Software Synario XACT This course will make heavy use CAD software the form Synario and XACT Synario includes schematic capture VHDL programming simulation and synthesis for PLDs andFPGAs XACT suite tools used for mapping circuits Xilinx FPGAs Synario installed the ten networked workstations the one with names XACT installed some subset the lab PCs you will have shift between machines use The software copy protected and any attempt tamper with this mechanism otherwise make illegal copies will dealt with very severely and through the same channels physical property theft defray the costs acquiring this software will require lab use fee separate check payable the University Washington Pentium Computers The Pentiums well those are connected the network and run under the Windows operating system Accounts the

they may gone when you return and someone else may put them use Design Kits Design Kits are portable kits that contain everything needed complete the laboratory assignmentsthat Project teams will check out DesignKits for the quarter kits will available the second week the quarter the DesignKit will card for keeping track extra items that you may need check out during the quarter will need security deposit for the DesignKit Security You will given personal entry code for the combination lock the door The lock will keep track when you enter the lab Please make sure keep the entry code yourself Unauthorized access the lab leads best inconvenience and worst theft and equipment loss All these harm you directly The lab will available for your use hours day not allow ANYONE into the lab and make sure the windows and doors are locked all times cannot guarantee that things you leave the lab unattended will not stolen Unfortunately there tradeoff between security and access you are all good citizens should able have access and secure environment Stephen Lee the engineering technician charge the lab will available during normal business hours will the person from whom you will the combination lock codes Any problems with laboratory equipment and software should immediately reported him not remove any equipment documentation tools from the room Please see Stephen you need check out manual anything else overnight Money You will need bring two checks the lab One for defray the cost the commercial software you will using and security deposit for the DesignKits you will issued and other materials parts tools equipment and documentation you may check out from the lab Make checks out the University Washington These will due the end the first week class The checks will returned the end the quarter when the DesignKits and any other parts equipment documentation borrowed the interim are returned good shape You will held personally responsible for any damage parts and equipment The checks will cashed ebeling washington edu
