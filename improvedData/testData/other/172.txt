construct and debug substantial project that includes hardware software and communication components Lectures focus use embedded processors digital system design and interfacing techniques Writing and debugging real time reactive software emphasized Prerequistes CSE and CSE Course Goals gain familiarity with the basic components modern digital systems and apply this knowledge the construction complete working design using state the art computer aided design techniques and debugging equipment Enrollment auditing the class will permitted and only registered students may attend will assume that all students know the prerequisite material CSE CSE there will little opportunity for catching Textbook Jones and Flynn Mobile Robots Inspiration Implementation Peters and supplementary notes distributed class Assignments There will assignments that will include both written and laboratory exercises Exams There will one hour mid term exam now scheduled for for April and final exam The midterm will open book and notes Grading The course grade will roughly determined follows Assignments written and laboratory Midterm Exam Project Participation and intangibles Project The main emphasis this course the design construction and documentation substantial project which will need demonstrated Friday June The project report and possible projects will discussed during the first week and students will asked find project partners and choose project during the second week Collaboration Part the objective this course provide some experience working team However this does not mean that there split the material learned There simple rule keep mind when working with your partner each you should able answer any question about the project never want hear partner did that need ask her what she did Make sure pick your partner carefully and make sure that you are compatible terms personality objectives and study habits Hardware Lab The hardware laboratory Sieg There are fifteen workbenches the lab ten which are equipped with Intel Pentium based running Windows Tektronix logic analyzer are also most stations addition there Data PLD programmer Multimeters oscilloscopes and other tools equipment will made available upon request talk Stephen Lee the first part the course you will using the lab for lab assignments Although there are scheduled lab hours during which will talk about the various tools and equipment you are generally free the lab assignments your own convenience Most the lab assignments are geared toward learning the software and debugging tools You will obtaining this familiarity prototyping several small circuits Each pair students will check out DesignKit for the quarterthat will contain everything needed complete the laboratory assignments kits will available during the first week the quarter Although you will working groups two expect each person fully understand all aspects the laboratory assignments and their project Questions that may have should answerable either member the team the DesignKits will card for keeping track extra items that you may need check out during the quarter There will absolutely food drink brought into the lab and you should refrain from activities that disrupt fellow students Smoking strictly prohibited throughout the building and this especially includes the lab Please help keep the lab clean and neat with equipment manulas and tools their proper place you are going gone from the lab for any length time please clear your working space someone else will able work Since other students have

frustrating matter may get Keep the lab clean and neat Take care with the equipment and parts Make good use the limited bench and shelf space will pay off the long run good citizen Software This course makes heavy use CAD software the form Synario schematic editing logic synthesis and simulation package from DATA Corporation based Redmond use XACT supplied Xilinx Corporation map circuits FPGAs These packages will installed all the lab machines defray the cost acquiring this software will require lab use fee separate check payable the University Washington The software copy protected and any attempt tamper with this mechanism otherwise make illegal copies will dealt with very severely and through the same channels physical property theft Lab Security You will given personal entry code for the combination lock the door you will obtain your combination with the DesignKit The lock will keep track when you enter the lab Please make sure keep the entry code yourself Unauthorized access the lab leads best inconvenience and worst theft and equipment loss All these harm you directly The lab will available for your use hours day Only students registered for should allowed into the lab and the windows and doors should locked all times cannot guarantee that things you leave the lab unattended will not stolen Unfortunately there tradeoff between security and access you are all good citizens should able have flexible access and secure environment Stephen Lee will available during normal business hours will the person whom you will give deposit checks and from whom you will obtain DesignKits combination lock codes and anything else you may need over the course the quarter Any problems with laboratory equipment and software should immediately reported him not remove and equipment documentation tools from the room Please see Stephen Lee you need check out manual anything else overnight you ever see anyone the laboratory that you think does not belong there inform Stephen one the TAs myself immediately are not available call the University Police And remember not let anyone into the lab matter how hard they knock the door Parts and Money You will need pay defray the cost the commercial software you will using and security deposit for the DesignKits you will issued and other materials parts tools quipment and documentation you may check out from the lab Make checks out the University Washington These will due the first laboratory meeting this week Each project group will thus have bring two checks check out DesignKit and two checks for the lab fee The checks will returned the end the quarter when the DesignKits and any other parts equipment documentation borrowed the interim are return good shape You will held personally repsonsible for any damage parts and equipment The checks will chased The kits will available the first week class stock variety common parts the laboratory which you can use for your projects but you will undoubtedly have obtain special parts that don have stock Warning can take several weeks get delivery determine early what you will needing you have our blessing you will imbursed for the parts you buy for your project you intend keep your project then you will have buy all the parts including those that may have come with your DesignKit burns washington edu
