journey which undertook years ago finally coming end that point the roller coaster where the ride over and you sliding into the station time relax your death grip the safety bar attempt regain your composure and celebrate time contemplate the magnitude the achievement that allows call ourselves the Class For somehow after tremendous investments time and money after sleepless nights after noble brain cells that gave their lives the line duty have converged here today honoured and recognized for what have become the next few minutes would like describe view the journey taken and point out all those who helped along the way Most came Waterloo because appreciation perhaps infatuation with mathematics Others who grew with the Commodore the Apple came because computers were endlessly fascinating Although adored came Waterloo for the mathematics For math has always been like toy that constantly new Every day feels like you ripping off the wrapping paper for the first time And there math like the world largest Lego set Infinitely subtle infinitely varied just pick direction and follow far your imagination will take you That direction led Waterloo After short while Waterloo immersed mathematics like never before came startling realization Math was magic jargon could not understand was used summon these remarkable creatures called Theorems Theorems came all shapes and sizes too Lesser Theorems were known Propositions Some Theorems kept familiars called Lemmas And this magic could not harnessed the likes was far too clumsy and naive But longed understand and control mathematics knew that looked hard enough would see right through the magic the ordered structure underneath And thus became determined uncover the process through which mathematics becomes magic That period awe marked the beginning the long journey that has brought all here Much has happened along the way events and experiences which shaped and infused with the spirit math Waterloo Personally developed love for computer science and predilection for card games deleveoped soft spot for self reference and taste for institutional food all absorbed the majority the Greek alphabet osmosis was only last term here that finally learned how write zeta Many learned that the air conditioners the computer labs shut down Some also learned that they reactivate There were parties some wild some not wild There was Oktoberfest and Canada Day the Bombshelter and Fed Hall And the Comfy Lounge And work terms And thirteen moving days And even occasionally lectures And finally this goes without saying that none could have done alone Each relied the guidance and support many others make this far Those people should recognized for their contributions towards our achievement The group that held the most explicit power over our destinies certainly the faculty Fortunately for our faculty outstanding sure some profs will make life difficult for you but consider that the exception and only for four months right When think the professors had think people who bent over backwards for who made every possible allowance see come through intact think people who went way beyond the call duty bring the education that wanted have Without their support couldn have made The students among will certainly recognize the importance our employers have had our undergraduate careers Work terms provided context for knowledge acquired lectures and helped solidify that knowledge preparation for coming school terms Work terms also provided much needed funds and endless supply shirts The ones most responsible for our well being the other hand were our friends and fellow students They the ones who made the daily grind university life tolerable Right from first day Waterloo have formed friendships that can only hope will last lifetime You have all been wonderful And with all the incredible talent and achievement the Class proud call many you friends Finally and maybe most importantly all cannot forget our families Whether near far geographically their fundamental influence our lives will always felt Thank you all the families who came today bear witness our accomplishments own family here today from Montreal They were always supportive throughout time here Yes can still recall father gentle words encouragement AMBITION You only going double major Pure Math and That what everybody doing these days Seriously though there one thing that has led success more than anything else what have learned from parents They taught that should follow pursuits with tenacity and with the thrill the chase They taught that every avenue left unexplored opportunity lost forever They taught that with little determination can anything and anyone want Now that the journey almost over you may wonder what became mission Did manage locate the order and structure beneath the magical outer layer mathematics Well after five years careful observation pleased report that mathematics still total magic Underneath all the jargon all the neat covering tracks all the perceived magic there lurks the real magic the true soul mathematics forever only visible the minutest cross sections Math difficult takes patience right But when you tackling that hard problem and inspiration hits and all the pieces fall into place HUZZAH That the kind magic talking about and that what makes all worthwhile This journey over Now the fun part the future begins Class shared great deal But remember one thing friends The single most important thing shared the spirit mathematics Waterloo And wherever your future may lead remember always take that spirit with you
