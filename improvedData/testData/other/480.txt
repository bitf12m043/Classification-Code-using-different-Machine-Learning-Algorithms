for Advanced Studies Toronto embarked cross country trek back Seattle Not believing the oft repeated rumor that the shortest distance between two points straight line proceeded drive from Toronto Seattle via Madison Denver and Moab favorite part the trip was the days spent winding way through southern Utah well worth the detour you ever get the chance took number pictures along the way but due own stupidity the first roll film containing pictures the Badlands Wall Drug Mount Rushmore and other highlights South Dakota and Wyoming was ruined Destination CityMiles DrivenHighlights Ann Arbor Michigan left Toronto mid morning and headed towards Ann Arbor was snowing fortunately this was the only bad weather encountered for the entire trip After some casual pub crawling crashed for the night the palatial digs Jeff Neill aka Corny Bennet aka Willow Jeff former Chelmsdale Wah Tut guy who has not yet jumped the WWW bandwagon Madison Wisconsin The next night headed into the frozen tundra and visited Doug Madison Doug and suffered through whole host undergrad courses together Yale climaxing our semester long quest write adaptation nethack Haskell Sioux Falls South Dakota There really not much see between Madison and Sioux Falls Highlights this leg the trip include driving across the entire state Minnesota without stopping miles playing Red Barchetta maximal volume and the incredibly nice state trooper Wisconsin who only gave written warning Hot Springs South Dakota South Dakota big And flat The monotony the prairies alongside was only broken signs for Wall Drug Around mid morning snuck into the Badlands but wasn able see much since the government was shut down and the park was officially closed Also made the pilgrimage Wall Drug for cup coffee still only nickel After Wall Drug continued west through the Black Hills with side trip Mount Rushmore Mount Rushmore itself was fairly unimpressive but the Black Hills themselves are worth seeing continued through them Hot Springs was treated magnificent sunset Longmont Colorado After uneventful but fast drive through the southern corner Wyoming stopped for couple days visit family Longmont about hour north Denver Fortunately while was Longmont the yahoos Washington got their act together and didn have cancel plans take side trip visit the National Parks Utah Moab Utah After spending relaxing weekend Longmont headed south Denver and then through the Rockies little Honda was not thrilled about the step inclines and the high elevations but eventually limped our way through the other side Following the advice Uncle Ken petroleum geologist who has spent fair amount time well sitting Utah drove into Moab via the state highway from Cisco spectacular drive along the Colorado River the late afternoon sun really brought out the reds and oranges the canyon walls These were the last pictures taken ill fated first roll file After finding place stay Moab headed out Dead Horse Point State Park watch the sunset over the canyonlands Bryce Utah spent the morning tromping around Arches National Park Arches are formed when wind and water erode the centers fins sandstone Landscape arch the longest arch the park with span feet Double Arch and Double Arch are fairly unusual formations give you idea the scale the small white blob person standing under the lower arch the Double stopped for lunch Partition Arch with its spectacular view out across the Devil Garden Some other arches the park are South Window Arch and Wall Arch After leaving Arches headed west towards Bryce through scenic but virtually uninhabited south central Utah There stretch here that has exits for miles Zion Utah spent the whole day exploring Bryce Canyon National Park Overall this was favorite day the trip Two very special aspects Bryce were the incredible atmospheric clarity the day was there one could see clearly for miles and the quiet Hiking along the base the canyon could hear the wind blowing through the trees along the canyon rim feet overhead the morning and early afternoon hiked the miles the Fairyland loop trail experience highly recommend anyone with the time savor The trail descends from the canyon rim into incredible world delicately shaded pink and orange limestone and fantastic hoodoos The serenity was indescribable during entire hike only saw three other people Later that afternoon hiked along the rim the main amphitheater and visited number other scenic viewpoints along the canyon rim think this picture came out really well After sitting and watching the sunset over the canyon reluctantly left Bryce Canyon and headed towards Zion Cedar City Utah Zion National Park was surprisingly busy considering that was Thanksgiving Day After taking quick hike through the constricted depths the narrows set out climb the top Angels Landing spire rock that towers feet over the base the canyon After steep but routine climb reached Scout Lookout located about feet above the canyon floor The last half mile the ascent Angels Landing consists harrowing traversal narrow ledge with foot drop either side followed scramble the backside the spire itself The view from the top was breathtaking After descending from the heights Angels Landing checked out several other close the road scenic viewpoints the park The late afternoon sun highlights the reds and oranges the canyon wall this picture Boise Idaho Drove over miles nuff said Seattle Washington Appropriately enough started drive through the Cascades started rain For the last miles the weather had been great the closer got Seattle the harder rained Despite the lousy weather after almost two weeks the road was nice get home grove washington edu
