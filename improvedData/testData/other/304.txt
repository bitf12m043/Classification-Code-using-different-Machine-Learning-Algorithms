Computer Science and Engineering University Washington This note informal description our tutoring and mentoring program for women and minority students hope this information useful and would grateful for any suggestions recommendations based the experience other departments Please send correspondence Alan Borning borning washington edu Women and minority students are generally underrepresented computer science and computer engineering programs and our program exception have two separate degrees Computer Science through the College Arts and Science and Computer Engineering through the College Engineering There very competitive admission process for both Grades don tell the whole story course but just for calibration the average GPA students admitted Computer Engineering about and about for Computer Science Once students are admitted the major there further weeding out our intent that all students who are admitted the major should able complete but nevertheless difficult and demanding course study looking for ways increase the retention and success underrepresented minority students our undergraduate majors instituted tutoring program The tutoring program has since expanded include women who aren minorities well setting and operating the program received help from several other programs the College Engineering namely the Minority Science and Engineering Program MSEP Women Engineering WIE and the Engineering Coalition Schools for Excellence Education and Leadership ECSEL The tutor graduate student our department paid hour week teaching assistant the same course inform students who are eligible for tutoring about the program mail and sometimes written letter when they first enter the program since not all students are regular mail users when they begin the major Participation completely voluntary The first tutor Derrick Weathersby did most the tutoring personally Tutoring was available for any majors course which meant that Derrick had know lot different material Derrick also paid much attention the social and cultural aspects well the pure academic ones succeeding creating supportive environment for the students tutored sort coach role For his work the program Derrick won the College Engineering Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award Spring Ruth Anderson has been the tutor since Autumn and has carried this strong tradition Prior accepting the tutor position Ruth won the Department Bob Bandes Memorial Award for outstanding work teaching assistant During this time noted above expanded the program include other undergraduate women addition minorities accomodate more students Ruth changed her role include both tutoring and coordinating considerable number volunteer tutors who are other graduate students Problems One problem with single tutor for many courses that the tutor needs very broad knowledge many computer science topics having volunteers available well helps with this problem Another possible problem that the program would cause resentments among students not receiving tutoring being unfair One the undergraduate women who didn use the tutoring program expressed this concern while haven heard complaints from other students possible there are such feelings Finally resources have been recurring difficulty Funding has been scrounged from various sources MSEP ECSEL money from endowment within the department fund scholarships and fellowships for women and minorities and sometimes from our regular budget but managed The cost the program that for for the academic year currently about more difficult problem that our department has severe shortage qualified TAs and the program may remove often one our best TAs from the pool Evaluation the end the first year asked Neetha Ravjee from the ECSEL evaluation group with help from Gerry Gillmore the Office Educational Assessment design and carry out evaluation the program The purpose this evaluation was help decide whether the program has been useful whether worth continuing and what changes should made addition hoped the the evaluation might helpful when seeking longer term funding for the program The bottom line was that the program was very successful substantiated both numeric data and the comments copy the evaluation available separate web page haven requested formal evaluation since the first one but the feedback from the students volunteers and advisors indicates that the program continuing successful For example one student recently wrote been having graduate student tutor for one the courses take ever since last winter The tutoring program works perfectly for not only get questions answered from those courses but also general questions about graduate studies this field got know more general the life being grad student and tutors have been giving really good advice what could order get myself better prepared for grad school tutors have been really helpful coursework They know lot about the specific field and they explain things well Maybe just but this kind one one tutoring works very good for Just little thoughts about the tutoring program really glad that have this program here the department Another student writes like think very useful talk somebody one one regular basis more than most minutes office hours helps also see different way looking problem and also like have somebody knowledgeable can talk about class Verbalizing problem often half solves problem for Finally many the graduate student volunteer tutors said they had found being tutor rewarding experience borning washington edu Last Update
