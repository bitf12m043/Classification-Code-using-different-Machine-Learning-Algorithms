think LazowskaDepartment Computer Science EngineeringUniversity Washington September The just released Conference Board study research doctorate programs the United States includes measure for each program labeled Median Years Degree which widely interpreted the median number years that students spend this graduate program Don fooled fact what the study reports best described the median number years that elapse from when the student first enters any educational program any field any institution after receiving his her Bachelors degree until the student receives his her Suppose for example that student enters Masters program immediately after receiving his her Bachelors degree and graduates from this Masters program years Then the student enters the workforce for years Wanting make the transition research perhaps entirely different field than the Masters degree the student then enrolls program from which graduates years later The granting institution probably feels pretty good cranked this student out years But the Conference Board study this student will weigh years This semantic confusion one issue all attribute particular semantics the MYD measure which not all what actually represents careful definition MYD would reduce confusion somewhat But many would still confused the misleading title And even the semantic confusion could cleared opinion that the MYD measure does not convey information that characterizes meaningful way the graduate program which attached not relevant student trying choose between graduate programs nor administrator looking for bloated programs might even argue that does not represent something worth tabulating and reporting all and that confusing Looking more broadly than individual graduate programs question whether MYD even germane field whole since many factors contribute the measure Background the Department Computer Science Engineering the University Washington routinely calculate the median time that students spend our doctoral program This number has been stable between and years for more than decade not require Masters degree route this number represents total time graduate school for student who enters directly from bachelors program There are tricky semantics here exactly what you expect were therefore surprised when the new Conference Board study reported years the MYD for our program Spurred MIT which noticed similar phenomenon explored further Our first step was calculate the median time spent our program for graduates the specific years considered the Conference Board study did this using our own database and confirmed value the year range Next with the help our Graduate School obtained data directly from the NRC Survey Earned Doctorates the actual data that had been used input the Conference Board study Graduating students fill out SED form which sent NRC The SED form asks the student for wide range data year high school graduation years attendance every college including year and graduate institution where the student has spent time full time equivalent years student since receipt first Bachelors degree etc While there were course few glitches among our odd graduates over the multi year reporting interval overall the return rate was very high and the quality the data was very good calculated variety measures from this data and formed variety hypotheses Finally NRC staff provided essential assistance working their calculations for our program and reviewing them with Without this assistance way beyond the call duty would still speculating Data gathering and analysis for the study are the responsibility NRC Office Scientific and Engineering Personnel which looks human resource issues across all science and engineering fields What MYD Really Means noted the preamble the MYD measure the Conference Board study while widely interpreted the median number years that students spend this graduate program fact the median number years that elapse from when the student first enters any educational program any field any institution after receiving his her Bachelors degree until the student receives his her disciplines instances where significant employment occurs between receipt Masters degree and entry into program the difference can huge This not measure that ever calculated for our graduate program nor measure that consider particularly germane Surely time spent fully employed part career plan between receiving Masters degree from some other institution and enrolling our graduate program not characteristic our graduate program Pushing bit harder not even obvious that the time spent that Masters program elsewhere germane since don require Masters degree route the and all students regardless background enter our program even footing terms the checkpoints the program This far the greatest source the discrepancy between the MYD figure reported the Conference Board study and our own intuition about our graduate program worth noting though that even when use the Conference Board MYD definition and calculate this measure from our own database obtain somewhat different results than the Conference Board study There are several secondary contributing factors which may interest First the Conference Board study calculates integer number years for each student subtracting the calendar year entry from the calendar year exit student who enters September Year and graduates January Year actually spent years the program but will reported small but consistent effect since most students first enroll the fall worth noting this context how the study arrives MYD that reported two decimal digits Those students who fall the median year are considered have graduated uniformly across that year and based upon this offset within that year calculated two digits and reported Second students occasionally mis code themselves the case our own program four students coded themselves Computer Engineering rather than Computer Science and were attributed our Electrical Engineering department the study offset four students never heard who coded themselves Computer Science Third students who omit essential fields from the SED form must course omitted from the calculation This affected non negligible number our graduates For simplicity this explanation has been presented the context the University Washington Department Computer Science Engineering but applies all programs surveyed the Conference Board study Lessons State definitions precisely From the Conference Board study document one would unlikely discern this definition MYD and its implications Avoid using titles that will assumed many mean something other than what really being reported better choose title with obvious semantics than one with the wrong obvious semantics mindful correct definitions when making statements Statements the Conference Board study document such took graduates the longer earn degree average than graduates these programs took years earlier would seem contribute misinterpretation Consider the appropriateness measures Understanding the definition MYD will allow the community consider this the most appropriate measure The SED form includes wide variety data MYD the measure that the Conference Board study has chosen calculate and use Don confuse accuracy and precision The Conference Board study reports two decimal digits widely misunderstood measure with lots fuzz Handling survey instruments difficult Coding errors are inevitable the community wants reliable analyses are going have take the time verify that are providing reliable data Acknowledgements Jeff Dean graduate student our department noticed the anomalous figure reported for immediately after the Computing Research Association placed the Conference Board study Computer Science information the Web Juan Osuna CRA was responsible for this effort and also provided much assistance tracking things down John Guttag MIT contacted after noting the same anomaly for his program and furnished considerable guidance the University Washington contributions came from Frankye Jones our staff graduate program advisor Carl Ebeling our faculty graduate program advisor Dale Johnson Dean the Graduate School and John Drew Manager Computer Services the Graduate School the National Academy Sciences Charlotte Kuh and Jim Voytuk the Office Scientific and Engineering Personnel the organization responsible for the Conference Board study expended large amount time and patience helping understand what was going important note the magnitude and complexity
