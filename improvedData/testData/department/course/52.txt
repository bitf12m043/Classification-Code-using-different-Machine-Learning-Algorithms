assignment read Chapter the course notes and exercise The second assignment due Wednesday April Read Chapter the course notes and exercises Next determine the most convenient way run KHOROS and CANTATA for you CSE runs Suns such Lillith Edit your local workstation login file contain xhost lillith Then add you cshrc file the Suns the following setenv KHOROS HOME usr local khoros setenv MANPATH usr local khoros man set path KHOROS HOME bin path After rlogin onto Lillith with your rhost assignments and DISPLAY environment variable set appropriately type cantata the Unix prompt the machine george has KHOROS and CANTATA installed Also our course home page the WWW http www washington edu education courses index html and follow the links the KHOROS CANTATA tutorial its course outline experiments and least the first two topics Image information and Spatial Resolution The ideal way take the tutorial read the web pages and experiment with KHOROS another window There nothing turn for this part the assignment The third assignment read the article Lin Huertas and Nevatia the CVPR proceedings and also look the article Wolff The fourth assignment due Monday April this assignment make comparison three image processing software environments KHOROS MSVC Image and MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox The objects the assignment are gain some experience with each environment begin get feel for the strengths and weaknesses each these environments and explore the use convolution noise suppression and edge detection each environment select monochrome test image apply the Sobel operation the test image apply moving average filter the test image apply laplacian the test image simulate gaussian smoothing with larger standard deviation gaussians iteratively applying the moving average filter apply the laplacian each gaussian smoothed image describe the results obtained terms changes appearance objects and contours the test image describe the following aspects the implementation what menu selections direct manipulations programming you had perform the experiments how fast the operations ran and level learning effort required your part Announcements The final examination will Monday June from our regular class meeting room The exam will cover combination pre midterm and post midterm material Here list topics study Reminder the class approved Sunday June from the time for the final exam review meeting The plan meet Sieg Outlines for selected class periods are available here Friday April Monday May Wednesday May Monday May Friday May Monday May

Trainable Classifiers Friday May Students are permitted get temporary copy MATLAB for their own use the course This will require that you fill out form and sign contract Let know you are interested Term projects are important part the course These are started during the week April Here are some corrections the course notes Friday April were introduced the Pentium laboratory including the MSVC software development environment Here Evan McLain document explaining how add new transform the Image application Here Current status the KHOROS installation the Suns contains the most recent information about getting started with Khoros and the accompanying DIP course Please read this class Friday March Monday April Most students already have computer account that can access KHOROS and CANTATA you not contact Renee Reed Thursday Friday make arrangement pick your account login name and password that you can use over the weekend and early next week Renee hours are limited plan ahead Her email address reed and she part Sieg back office Sieg kept locked you will either need knock have prior arrangement meet her Many the account application cards were not signed will have take care
