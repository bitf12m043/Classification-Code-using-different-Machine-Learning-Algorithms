also posted here Number Credits Grading Homework Midterm exam Final exam Project Class participation Hardcopy Readings Text selected sections Many the readings for the course will online but the first set readings part recent book Lisp and artificial intelligence There will several readings from the book throughout the course including readings Lisp logic programming and Prolog grammars and parsing language understanding systems and shells for expert systems You can either purchase the whole book the bookstore approximately copies have been ordered combination getting copies from the copy center and reading the library The book entitled The Elements Artificial Intelligence Using Common Lisp edition Freeman Chapter Introduction Programming Common Lisp and the Lisp glossary may purchased separately the Copy Center the basement the Communications Building Online reference materials for Lisp What Lisp The Lisp FAQ provides the answers many questions about Lisp and its implementations Common Lisp The Language edition the standard reference Common Lisp seems best you access via the table contents page rather than trying download the entire HTML file postscript You can get the source code for the Lisp programs from The Elements Artificial Intelligence Using Common Lisp edition The web site for Digitool Inc the company that maintains and supports Macintosh Common Lisp provides the most current information about MCL Here are some interesting links info about how use Lisp for programming World Wide Web applications Online reference materials for Introduction Programming online tutorial Programming another online tutorial but website the that doesn always respond promptly These are two the several tutorials that are listed here Online reference materials for Java The Java language trail map Announcements January Welcome this course and its course web This course about programming languages and their implementation some the department listings called Languages and Compilers although the catalog called Programming Languages and Their Implementation covers interpreters compilers and other techniques for building programming systems Our attention will focus mainly two particular programming languages Lisp and With Lisp will explore many issues relevant intepreted languages while with will investigate compilers addition traditional language issues and techniques will also look into current issues such visual programming systems and programming facilities for the World Wide Web January Facilities This quarter CSE students will have the use both the MSCC Macintoshes running Macintosh Common Lisp and the MSCC Unix systems MSCC the Mathematical Sciences Computing Center The MSCC Macs are located the basement Thompson Hall Some the Macs are Room and some Room While the Macs offer MCL and variety other languages such Mathematica the MSCC Unix hosts offer Lex Yacc Allegro Common Lisp and other software facilities Macintosh Common Lisp provides particularly powerful environment including full implementation the Common Lisp standard integrated editor called FRED and extensive facilities for graphics and user interface construction The Macintosh computers are networked and files can easily transferred between them and the Unix host machines MSCC Students who have difficulty getting the Macintoshes Thompson Hall can supplement their Macintosh work with work their own PCs using such packages XLISP STAT for Windows and Micro Emacs However due our limited ability support alternative facilities students who wish work their own PCs will need access these resources themselves from archives the Internet Also note that XLISP STAT bare bones implementation Common Lisp and does not have the extensive program development support that MCL has While are fortunate have the powerful MCL system for this course there one disadvantage using you must use the MSCC lab unless you purchase your own copy from Digitool Inc MCL normally costs about copy but there special student deal allowing students purchase for has been pointed out that there free version Allegro Common Lisp for Windows which can downloaded from franz com the Web This may attractive tool for some students Final examination The final exam for CSE will given Monday March Sieg from will closed book test January NOTE THIS Thursday January will meet Thompson Hall Room
