washington eduCourse Description Instructional Objectives Teaching the terminology and concepts software engineering Teaching the fundamentals software project management and working team Providing experience with real industrial software engineering project Teaching oral and written communication skills Producing portfolio This course will study the concepts methods and tools for the specification design construction testing analysis and documentation large software systems Included also will non technical topics essential creating complex software systems successfully project management effective oral and written communication and group interaction These latter topics are what most industrial feedback says are the most important employers and are the most often lacking our graduates This experimental version CSE lasting two quarters will use real Boeing project example and the participants will work one large group There are several reasons for trying this new approach The first that one quarter too short for realistic project students cannot learn enough about software engineering due class sessions being devoted discussing and organizing the project the regular class the group projects are also usually learning experiences about how hard work group but not enough learned about how work effectively together having one group headed the instructor disasters can avoided and more experience can provided the correct way work together addition students will get experience requirements analysis and real software development that not possible the normal class setting the end the two quarters students will have portfolio real software engineering project that they can use their job search example such portfolio done for the CMU Software Engineering Institute Masters Software Engineering program will provided the first class meeting the class each student will assigned specific role play that will allow them experience leadership position see attached list roles However everyone will participate each phase the project they can learn how each part The instructor will act the project manager Outline Topics Nature qualities and principles software and software engineering Management software projects process models working groups project planning risk assessment cost estimation metrics etc Requirements analysis Specification Software design Verification and validation testing and analysis Configuration management Reviews Maintenance evolution Reuse Ethics and professionalism software engineering Embedded systems and safety Roles for Class Project Each student will take one these leadership roles for the project However everyone will participate each activity reviews the activity that they get experience with each aspect
