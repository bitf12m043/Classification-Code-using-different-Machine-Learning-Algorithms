project ARPA sponsored effort make computer science technical reports more easily accessible part that work designed distributed technical report server which now running many universities interested Corporate Group Memory meaning electronic systems for capturing and accessing the knowledge used and produced the workers institution order increase the quality reduce the time required future work Corporate memory includes not just the intellectual products the institution engineer designs lawyer contracts author screenplays but also knowledge about the process that produced the product knowledge dead ends explored tools used and justifications supporting the final decisions have also begun project with Dan Huttenlocher developing corporate memory through shared annotation structured documents This project investigates how people can share information reading and writing annotations electronic documents shared the group initial prototype implementation being used Cornell class Here the shared documents are problem sets and course notes and nnotations might requests for clarifications students technical questions corrections made staff The question whether this will useful means for students obtain answers whether students will find each other questions useful source for learning whether students will often able answer each other questions correctly and whether the course staff will find this useful means for feedback improving the course far the evidence that they also interested natural language generation and the design computational proxies agents which can safely and reliably carry out remote computations foreign machines without risk either you the owner the remote machine See alsoPapers Online copies some publicatiions Web resource for the DRI list

everyone including parents does not quite sure who what here the best explanation developed far many ways the question who person defined what that person does case software engineer who develops semi real time operating systems and utilities been doing that for the last years Before that was BSD Kernel Hacker and Unix system Administrator create things and that why engineer engineer applies science the design and construction things and that what You can really call scientist though have Computer Sciences degree more Mad Scientist The guy who pays David DeWitt who scientist shudders methodology the other hand right most the time works for When not designing architecting and implementing new operating system type things often doing the same other things Some those other things are FORTH system Woodworking Home Control Drawing and Brewing Beer completely relax try sleep works wonders But sleep not enough although roommate disagrees with Other pursuits which enjoy are flying reading science fiction comic books railroading both prototype and model and role playing games You may notice images the most sublime striped creature the Tiger appearing throughout WWW pages Tiger has taken for his own William Blake poem Tyger Tyger puts words the wonder Tiger the Road Again tremendous leap insanity purchased house The address new place Josef Burger East Gate Road Monona The new voice number Boring Work Work work drives bananas used fun but now grunge Either matured the jobs has changed over the years perhaps some both seems like get new parallel computers every other month and have beat them into submission while doing everything else under the sun moon and stars currently working the following projects for Dave DeWitt world famous database hacker Gamma parallel relational database OQL SQL like query interpreter for object stores Paradise Geographic Information System implemented with Shore Shore object oriented data store WiSS The WIsconsin Storage System And whatever else needs done All this and whole lot more occurs the Computer Sciences Department the Madison Campus the University Wisconsin The campus located Madison USA peninsula between two Madison five lakes Not boring work addition work for the also consult don provide solutions but rather advice and technical expertise Helping out Internet Providers porting software new systems reviving old computers and other oddball tasks are the kinds things tell you visit web server but haven had time anything there mostly empty except for the home pages some friends Other activitiesUwvax operate the uwvax Usenet News and UUCP site free time All the news thats fit print something along those lines uwvax department computer has been part Usenet UUCP and the internet for longer than worked here Along the same lines also the Computer Sciences Department volunteer news master Much that goes hand hand with running uwvax However trying take care news readers across different architectures trying task don have much time take care that software Organizations member the following organizations don always agree with what they but they often have lot good benefits for both members and other users their communities AOPA the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association EAA the Experimental Aircraft Association Usenix Association Blitz Drinking When was school horde friends and myself visited local pub every Thursday night This place The Essen Haus imports beers from all over the world Slowly worked our way through their entire selection Over the years developed new acquaintances and many them became part our loftily labelled Blitz Drinking Society rather diverse some the members don drink meet once year the Essen Haus during the time Octoberfest have weekend fun Chud has accumulated short history and whatnot this charade Bolo Home Page Last modified Tue Apr CST Bolo Josef Burger bolo wisc edu
