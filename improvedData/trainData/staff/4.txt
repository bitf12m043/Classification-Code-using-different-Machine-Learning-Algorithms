Java really cool just got Roaster which Java development environment for Macintosh plan write whole bunch Java applets and post them here some consulting work for the Apple Education Consultant Program AECP you are interested using Macintosh education for research have interest developing Macintosh software give call planned few events for this term Some time February the doing OpenDoc hands demonstration OpenDoc pretty cool you interested check out Apple CyberDog Web site Very soon doing seminar Roaster the Macintosh hosted Java development kit Please let know either these interest you you have particular topic that you like see covered AECP seminar Office Hours AECP Office Hours are Tuesday Wednesday and Friday Drop and see More About got Computer Science from UVic years old the best computer programmer that know but don know lot people watch lot own Macintosh was Born Nelson but have never been back and have memory the town think astrology silly grew mostly Victoria Master Student Computer Science love music was born the same day Albert Einstien different year have short attention span read lot like think myself creative just had tooth filled December own Honda Civic favourite soft drink Pepper Pisces have forgotten lot about Unix enjoy contradictions think Quantum Physics fascinating favourite soft drink Mountain Dew Job real life the Manager the Systems Group Essential Planning Systems and also write lot code EPS develops and sells Geographic Information System software worldwide EPS doesn have Web page yet which too bad because that means can put link here Our cousins PCI have page though the moment writing file access API for the Pamap GIS The rest our group working providing massive user interface enhancements Any technology distinguishable from

help you with your domain name problems even wanted InterNIC does lot neat things with all its NSF and NSI money and Net Scout one those things are located the Computer Sciences Department the University Wisconsin Madison Seeing how could never explain what Net Scout does elegantly our fearless leader Susan Calcari check out the Net Scout web page for official explanation some design and maintenance our web site and email list the Scout Report also assist Pete DeVries with tech support for our macs and UNIX machines Before coming Net Scout spent two and half years the Laboratory Molecular Biology Most that time was full time student well Molecular Biology was what called Technical Support Assistant Digital Video Specialist Which meant had run around fixing people broken mice and answering email questions most the time but when was lucky got make cool videos you are interested using digital video for instructional purposes check out Multimedia Services web page graduate
