technique for creating multiple label confocal images Basically these are cool looking images developing embryos that get lot journal and book covers also developed the Molecular Biology Web site the IMR was fortunate work with Prof John White and the rest the IMR staff While the IMR developed their Web site which received stars the Magellan Internet Guide last major project involved the
