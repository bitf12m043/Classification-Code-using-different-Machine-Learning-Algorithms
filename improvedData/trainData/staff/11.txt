Wisconsin Madison scal wisc eduMy title Internet Scout and manage Net Scout Services from the Computer Sciences Department the University Wisconsin Madison Scout Services project the InterNIC and supported the National Science Foundation Net Scout Services supports Internet users the higher education community providing timely information about the best resources and tools the Internet Our goal help researchers and educators use the Internet effectively their work Each week filter hundreds items about the Internet edit and organize the most important and present the information multiple usable formats Services include the Scout Report the Scout Toolkit Net happenings and coming soon the Scout Sprouts Report newsletter written kids for kids Over people receive the Scout Report each week via email and thousands more read the Web The Scout Report annotated listing the best new and newly discovered Internet resources and tools and the only publication its kind devoted the research and education community The Scout Report very selective the items included each issue Over people receive Net happenings postings every weekday and again thousands more read via the Web the newsgroup each day See the Net Scout Services page for more information these and other services Professional Background have been involved nation wide Internet projects since when joined Merit Inc Ann Arbor the organization that managed the NSFNET backbone project from worked the Information Services division the project and spent three years speaking national and international higher education audiences about the Internet and its resources also developed and produced the Merit Network Seminar Series the first national seminar series focused the needs Internet end users Later became the Director Network Information Services for CERFnet respected Internet provider based San Diego While there wrote the proposal which resulted the award part the InterNIC project under year cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation NSF the third year the agreement NSF terminated the portion the InterNIC based San Diego but chose continue the work the Internet Scout that time elected relocate Wisconsin and requested that NSF approve the relocation the Scout project the Computer Sciences department Madison which they heartily agreed Future Plans for Scout ServicesAt this time the Scout Services staff includes Jack Solock Special Librarian and myself During May the project will expand with the addition FTE including open System Administrator position and open Special Librarian position June Matthew Livesey will join the staff Project Assistant Goals for the new staff will include expansion the Scout Toolkit and the addition discipline specific services such Scout Reports and Web pages devoted specific areas study During Scout Services will also branch into one more research areas collaboration with InterNIC Support Services and with groups Madison and other campuses Potential research topics include network information discovery and retrieval NIDR and discipline oriented information gathering and publication Depending the nature the research additional staff will hired and will include computer science researchers the graduate and undergraduate levels For More Information Visit our Web site find out more about Scout Services join any our mailing lists you are
