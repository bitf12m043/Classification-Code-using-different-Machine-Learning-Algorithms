Computer Science University Texas Austin gunnels utexas edu Markus Dale Department Computer Science University Texas Austin mdale utexas edu Notes lesson not putting off this stuff waiting for llano eureka become available ran into weird bug Sunday well since really started Sunday guess that kind redundant For some reason the permutation routine chokes when the pieces being sent around climb above certain size For example can mult processors with block size but NOT checked for malloc failures but that wasn results here are very sketchy Actually would rather get some timings eureka llano before try tune this thing Well there problem eureka this respect Some preliminary data also more encouraging far performance eureka Although not what are aiming for grid eureka achieves MFLOPS when the local size hits The problem has been fixed however was matter using Irecv instead receive basically implementing the collect perhaps should have just used MPI Allgather However these messages were not very big would need read about the architecture guess but this seems pretty fragile BTW the code does handle non square matrices and meshes just need collect timings for those cases NOTE have tweaked the code little Basically add MFLOPS everything here will post the chart soon The code enclosed does not perform accuracy testing was removed make the runs because creates the global matrix each processor have version both spice and eureka that does the testing main ccsmmult ccolrow cglobals hrand Note There are least simple things could improve the performance this code Instead scattering followed permuting could simply permute from many That send the blocks immediately the processor that they will arrive after both the scatter and the permute step really make the code unreadable believe that you could use non blocking sends overlap the copying the send buffer with the sending blocks hour recode and test Using MPI Allgather instead our hand written bucket collect minutes code and test There simple test see you are sending yourself for all these routines This might improve performance great deal grids that are far from sqaure although this does partially void perhaps not MPI smart enough figure this out itself The only drawback would that really wouldn implementing the same code the mesh and small machine like eureka this MIGHT make the scalability appear either bad hard figure alpha beta gamma equation for square mesh there very simple trick that would REALLY speed things think the scatter step rows simply send the same row number that you are the col number that you are column you send row within column etc Then perform broadcast within columns Then you the analogous thing for the columns pretty sure that Prof van Geijn discussed this class one the shortcuts really mention just point out that that NOT what did because are presenting data for the square mesh case Date Tue Jan GMT Server Apache Content type text html Content length Last

more than two intersecting contours reach the osculating plane two strategies involving both pure translation and combination translation and rotation are analyzed Once the Frenet frame for the marked

relationship with respect shape prior its recognition show that there simple and efficient viewing strategy that allows the observer align the viewing direction with one the two principal directions for point the surface This strategy depends only curvature measurements the occluding contour and therefore demonstrates that recovering quantitative shape information from the contour does not

visual event curves defined the surface studying the epipolar parameterization develop two basic strategies that allow reconstruction surface region around any point reconstructible surface region These strategies control viewpoint achieve and maintain well defined geometric relationship with the object surface rely only information extracted directly from images tangents the occluding contour

SPIE Sensor Fusion postscript gzip postscript present approach for recovering global surface model object from the deformation the occluding contour using active mobile observer able control its motion particular consider two problems How can the observer viewpoint controlled order generate dense sequence images that allows incremental reconstruction unknown surface and how can construct global surface model from the generated image sequence Solving these two problems crucial for automatically constructing models objects whose surface non convex and self occludes achieve the first goal purposefully and qualitatively controlling the observer instantaneous direction motion order control the motion the visible rim over the surface achieve the second goal using calibrated trinocular camera rig and mechanism for controlling the relative position and orientation the viewed surface with respect the trinocular rig Exploring Three Dimensional Objects Controlling the Point

camera can used infer properties curved object three dimensional shape The unknown geometry environment objects the effects self occlusion the depth ambiguities caused the projection process and the presence noise image measurements are few the complications that make object dependent movements the camera advantageous certain shape recovery tasks Such movements can simplify local shape computations such curvature estimation allow use weaker camera calibration assumptions and enable the extraction global shape information for objects with complex surface geometry The utility object dependent camera movements studied the context three tasks each involving the extraction progressively richer information about object unknown shape detecting the occluding contour estimating surface curvature for points projecting the contour and building three dimensional model for object entire surface Our main result the development three distinct active vision strategies that solve these three tasks controlling the motion camera Occluding contour detection and surface curvature estimation are achieved exploiting the concept special viewpoint For any image there exist special camera positions from which the object view trivializes these tasks show that these positions can deterministically reached and that they enable shape recovery even when few markings and discontinuities exist the object surface and when differential camera motion measurements cannot accurately obtained basic issue building three dimensional global object models how control the camera motion that previously unreconstructed regions the object become reconstructed fundamental difficulty that the set reconstructed points can change unpredictably due self occlusions when hoc motion strategies are used show how global model building can achieved for generic objects arbitrary shape controlling the camera motion automatically selected surface tangent and normal planes that the boundary the already reconstructed regions guaranteed slide over the object entire surface Our work emphasizes the need for controlling camera motion through efficient processing the image stream and designing provably correct strategies strategies whose success can accurately characterized terms the geometry the viewed object For each task efficiency achieved extracting from each image only the information necessary move the camera differentially assuming dense sequence images and using rather than information control camera motion Provable correctness achieved controlling camera motion based the

Lumelsky Computer Sciences Department Technical Report November postscript gzip postscript present viewing strategy for exploring the surface unknown object making all its points visible purposefully controlling the motion active observer based simple relation between the instantaneous direction motion the observer the visibility points projecting the occluding contour and the surface normal those points the dot product the surface normal such points and the observer velocity positive the visibility the points guaranteed under infinitesimal viewpoint change show that this leads object exploration strategy which the observer purposefully controls its motion based the occluding contour order impose structure the set surface points explored make its representation simple and qualitative and provably solve the exploration problem for smooth generic surfaces arbitrary shape Unlike previous approaches where exploration cast discrete process asking where look next and where the successful exploration arbitrary objects not guaranteed our approach demonstrates that dynamic viewpoint control through directed observer motion leads qualitative exploration strategy that provably correct depends only the dynamic appearance the occluding contour and does not require the recovery detailed three dimensional shape descriptions from every position the observer Provable

shading study this situation define image flow field called the reflection flow field which describes the motion reflection points and the motion the surface From kinematic analysis show that the reflection flow qualitatively different from the motion parallax because discontinuous near parabolic curves also show that when the gradient the reflected image strong gradient based flow measurement
