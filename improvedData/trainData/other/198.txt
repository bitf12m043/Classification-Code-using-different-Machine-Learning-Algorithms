Natural Language AcquisitionNatural Language Acquisition view paper click the open book image Inductive Logic Programming for Natural Language Processing Raymond MooneyProceedings the International Inductive Logic Programming Workshop Stockholm Sweden August This paper reviews our recent work applying inductive logic programming the construction natural language processing systems have developed system CHILL that learns parser from training corpus parsed sentences inducing heuristics that control initial overly general shift reduce parser CHILL learns syntactic parsers well ones that translate English database queries directly into executable logical form The ATIS corpus airline information queries was used test the acquisition syntactic parsers and CHILL performed competitively with recent statistical methods English queries small database geography were used test the acquisition complete natural language interface and the parser that CHILL acquired was more accurate than existing hand coded system The paper also includes discussion several issues this work has raised regarding the capabilities and testing ILP systems well summary our current research directions Comparative Experiments Disambiguating Word Senses Illustration the Role Bias Machine Learning Raymond MooneyProceedings the Conference Empirical Methods Natural Language Processing Philadelphia May This paper describes experimental comparison seven different learning algorithms the problem learning disambiguate the meaning word from context The algorithms tested include statistical neural network decision tree rule based and case based classification techniques The specific problem tested involves disambiguating six senses the word line using the words the current and proceeding sentence context The statistical and neural network methods perform the best this particular problem and discuss potential reason for this observed difference also discuss the role bias machine learning and its importance explaining performance differences observed specific problems Learning Parse Database Queries using Inductive Logic Programming John Zelle and Raymond MooneyProceedings the

semantical and other aspects given parse state Corpus Based Lexical Acquisition For Semantic Parsing Cynthia Thompson proposal Department Computer Sciences University Texas Austin Building accurate and efficient natural language processing NLP systems important and difficult problem There has been increasing interest automating this process The lexicon the mapping from words meanings one component that typically difficult update and that changes from one domain the next Therefore automating the acquisition the lexicon important task automating the acquisition NLP systems This proposal describes system WOLFIE WOrd Learning From Interpreted Examples that learns lexicon from input consisting sentences paired with representations their meanings Preliminary experimental results show
