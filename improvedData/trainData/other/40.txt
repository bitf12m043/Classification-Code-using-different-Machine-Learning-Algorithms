What You Must DoWhat WhenLectures Mon Wed Fri Olin Prerequisites and equivalent courses Students are expected understand fundamental issues operating systems file systems and networks and comfortable programming the programming language Lecture Notes Texts and References Multimedia new and rapidly developing field comprehensive text that appropriate this course not available The required readings for this class will consist selected journal and conference articles well notes will produce All required readings will made available class You are expected read the material before coming class you will get significantly more out the lectures you Required will hand out course notes and copies the relevant papers Whenever possible will place these line but many the papers are not available line and can only copied Since the copying costs well beyond the amount allocated for the course you will ask pay towards the copying costs Please give check cash the Cindy Robinson Upson payable Cornell University the memo section the check write the course number Optional Partridge Gigabit Networking Addison Wesley Publishing Company Jain Fundamentals Digital Image Processing Prentice Hall You are not required buy the optional books Partridge excellent text next generation networks Jain great text Digital Image Processing line resources There will newsgroup for this course cornell class and WWW home page http www cornell edu Info Courses Current The slides used lecture will available electronically will any handouts that write and several the papers for the course Projects and Grades Laboratory Facilities All enrolled students will given accounts the Upson Undergraduate Lab room You are welcome use other machines for doing assignments Requirements Grading and Regrades graduate course and will graded like one expect give out mostly but this depends your doing the assigned work There final exam mid term this course Your grade determined three measures First you will graded your answers three homework assignments that will require programming and written responses Second you will complete small scale research project The homework assignments will constitute your grade the project will count for your grade Third you will required read the papers passed out For each paper you read you must post critique the paper the Web see below You must get passing grade the critiques pass this course The critiques otherwise have effect your grade You should work groups two three all assignments When working group hand single response for the group that includes the names all students the group The same grade will given each student expect all students group equally able answer questions about the program project Written problem sets should turned electronically before the beginning the lecture the due date Instructions for handing assignments will given with the assignment Late assignments will rejected Assignments will returned electronically Grades will posted indexed secret number you provide the web you believe that have made grading error please bring the matter our attention but later than one week after your assignment has been returned submit problem set for regrading send short note explaining clearly why you think should regraded one the TAs Academic Integrity expect students uphold Cornell standards academic integrity find out otherwise you will fail the course The work you submit expected the result your individual effort You are free discuss course material approaches problems and details the system with your colleagues and instructors but you should never misrepresent someone else work your own Permissible cooperation should never involve student possessing copy all part another student program other work regardless whether that copy paper computer file hard disk floppy disk The only exception the above rules when students work together submit joint project also the student responsibility protect his her work from unauthorized access For example not discard copies your programs public places someone turns your work you may held partly responsible The Bottom Line What You Must You must three things complete this course assignments critiques and the project Each assignment will tell you what you have hand Critiques and projects are described below Critiques For the papers you receive you must publish critique the paper the web The critique should available from your web page which you will create homework assignment one The purpose this critique get you think critically about what you read welcome graduate school Virginia For each paper your critique should answer the following questions one two paragraphs What the MAIN POINT this paper What SIGNIFICANT about this paper Could and experience practitioner REPRODUCE the results this paper What WEAK about the paper How could have been improved either the research the writing Rate the paper scale worst best will examine these critiques determine you have read and understood the paper Project Guidelines The final project small scale research project must have two qualities must attack research problem and must pertain multimedia what research Research proposes and evaluates new solution interesting problem This simple statement has two parts Research proposes and evaluates new solution Simply stating idea writing program not research because there evaluation You must evaluate the idea for become research Evaluation can take many forms For example suppose you develop new method for detecting scene breaks video sequence You can evaluate this idea implementing and compare the results your algorithm realistic video sequences with that existing algorithm Such comparison might compare the runtime performance the quality result how accurately did detect the scene breaks you might compare the results your algorithm the best results one that human produces Another example evaluation designing large system implementing and then discussing the tradeoffs the system design Such experience papers are very valuable other system builders Sometimes but rarely idea can novel enough that simply stating causes such new way looking things that research This very hard thing sell however better earth shaking and interesting problem how can you tell what interesting This clearly subjective but good metric ask how many people want know the answer your problem Medawar wrote Advice Young Scientist The only person interested why sea anemones have black spots the person studying why sea anemones not have black spots badly paraphrased Brian Remember just hard uninteresting research interesting research You will work groups two four students the final project you want work individually larger group you must ask Brian before Sept will provide list possible projects few weeks into the course you may explore idea your own subject our approval You will required write project report approximately ten pages length and make minute oral presentation Your grade will based equally the quality your research the quality your writing and the quality your presentation Sign sheets for the presentation will available later The best projects will selected present class during the last week classes Three milestones the and week marks will help measure your progress The first milestone Sept will brief written presentation one two paragraphs your two proposed projects primary and backup Such papers are called white papers normal research projects The second milestone Sept will short approximately page written project proposal The third milestone Oct Oct will minute presentation the status your project The final presentation will take place Nov and home page MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content

MooneyProceedings the Thirteenth National Conference Aritificial Intelligence Portland August AAAI Most research planning and learning has involved linear state based planners This paper presents SCOPE system for learning search control rules that improve the performance partial order planner SCOPE integrates explanation based and inductive learning techniques acquire control rules for partial order planner Learned rules are the form selection heuristics that help the planner choose between competing plan refinements Specifically SCOPE learns domain specific control rules for version the UCPOP planning algorithm The resulting system shown produce significant speedup two different planning domains Integrating EBL and ILP Acquire Control Rules for Planning Tara Estlin and Raymond MooneyProceedings the Third International Workshop Multi Strategy Learning Harpers Ferry May MSL Most approaches learning control information planning systems use explanation based learning generate control rules Unfortunately EBL alone often produces overly complex rules that actually decrease planning efficiency This paper presents novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming EBL used constrain inductive search for selection heuristics that help planner choose between competing plan refinements SCOPE one the few systems address learning control information the newer partial order planners Specifically SCOPE learns domain specific control rules for version the UCPOP planning algorithm The resulting system shown produce significant speedup two different planning domains Integrating Explanation Based and Inductive Learning Techniques Acquire Search Control for Planning Tara Estlin proposal Department Computer Sciences University Texas Austin Planning systems have become important tool for automating wide variety tasks Control knowledge guides planner find solutions quickly and crucial for efficient planning most domains Machine learning techniques enable planning system automatically acquire domain specific search control knowledge for different applications Past approaches learning control information have usually employed explanation based learning EBL generate control rules Unfortunately EBL alone often produces overly complex rules that actually decrease rather than improve overall planning efficiency This paper presents novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming our learning system SCOPE EBL used constrain inductive search for control heuristics that help planner choose between competing plan refinements SCOPE one the few systems address learning control information for newer partial order planners Specifically this proposal describes how SCOPE learns domain specific control rules for the UCPOP planning algorithm The resulting system shown produce significant speedup two different planning domains and more effective than pure EBL approach Future research will performed three main areas First SCOPE learning algorithm will extended include additional techniques such constructive induction and rule utility analysis Second SCOPE will more thoroughly tested several real world planning domains have been identified possible testbeds and more depth comparisons will drawn between SCOPE and other competing approaches Third SCOPE will implemented different planning system order test its portability other planning algorithms This work should demonstrate that machine learning techniques can powerful tool the quest for tractable real world planning Hybrid Learning Search Control for Partial Order Planning Tara Estlin and Raymond Mooney New Directions Planning Ghallab and Milani Eds IOS Press This paper presents results applying version the DOLPHIN search control learning system speed partial order planner DOLPHIN integrates explanation based and inductive learning techniques acquire effective clause selection rules for Prolog programs version the UCPOP partial order planning algorithm has been implemented Prolog program and DOLPHIN used automatically learn domain specific search control rules that help eliminate backtracking The resulting system shown produce significant speedup several planning domains Why Real world Planning Difficult Tale Two Applications Steve Chien Randall Hill XueMei Wang Tara Estlin Kristina Fayyad and Helen Mortenson New Directions Planning Ghallab and Milani Eds IOS Press this paper describe number obstacles hampering the application planning technology real world problems encountered two real world planning projects JPL MVP planning system for automated generation image processing procedures and LMCOA intelligent system for assistance antenna operations First describe how existing planning representation must enhanced represent and reason about aspects plans besides goal achievement resource usage quality execution time flexibility and generality Second planning systems must able fit into wide range operational contexts most planning tasks cannot completely automated therefore minimum the plans produced must easily understandable and modifiable the users some cases the user must intimately involved the plan construction process itself Third planning systems must able compare favorably terms software lifecycle costs other means automation such scripts rule based expert systems This means that development intelligent tools and environments facilitate knowledge acquisition validation and maintenance are prime importance hope that our description and elucidation these issues will lead increased work these areas Content Length
