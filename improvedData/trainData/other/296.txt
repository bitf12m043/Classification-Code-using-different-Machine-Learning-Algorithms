where was born Sapporo located the north part Japan cold and snowy Ithaca Winter Olympic was held here can get fresh seafood such clab delicious Ramen noodle and delicious corn have snow festival February Nagoya Aichi This where spent life junior school student Nagoya very hot and humid Nagoya castle very famous Uiro Japanese cake Kishimen flat noodle and Miso nikomi udon miso noodle are favorite Nakano Tokyo This where spent life junior high school high school and university freshman only student close center Tokyo One the famous buildings here Nakano Sun Plaza triangle building Tetsugakudo park beautiful park Tokorozawa Saitama This where spent life university student and where parents live have many cool spots such Seibu stadium course Seibu fan Seibu Kyoryu ten Tama lake and Sayama lake Kikusui Tei and Blue Berry are very nice restaurants from which can see beautiful Tama lake and sometimes Fuji north west Tokyo Machida Yamato Kanagawa This where lived since joined IBM Japan office Yamato south west Tokyo and also close Yokohama Boca Raton USA This where stayed for months business trip IBM Boca Raton paradise summer all the year close beaches Walt Disney World hrs Miami and Miami Beach Key West hrs Daytona Beach hrs Kennedy Space Center hrs and Petersburg hrs Ithaca USA This where live now nice rural place hrs north west from New York City often reminds Hokkaido Japan can concentrate studying because have temptation such Karaoke Mahjong bar etc also close Niagara Fall hrs and Toronto hrs Cayuga lake also nice Here picture taken Cayuga lake Anyway

Incomplete KnowledgeCambridge MIT Press xxvii pages ISBN Reviews Ernie Davis IEEE Expert December pages engaging exploration QSIM and its extensions This book major contribution the field For the student the best introduction qualitative simulation that has been written For the researcher summarizes more than years work very successful and productive research project Lucaciu ACM Computing Reviews July pages The book sparkling discourse that will engage the reader The many recent references offer solid basis for anyone beginning adventure modeling and simulation with incomplete knowledge Elisha Sacks Magazine Summer pages Kuipers sets himself the twin goals describing his research and writing textbook succeeds brilliantly the first goal The book well organized well reasoned well written and well illustrated The ideas are clearly stated the formalization concise and precise and the algorithms are explained detail The numerous examples and figures illustrate every aspect the research The clear and detailed exposition makes fine course text when supplemented few topics Andrew Frank Int Geographic Information Systems March pages This book may become very important book for Geographic Systems and for geography general despite the fact that does not discuss anything geographical spatial its pages must hoped that many geographers use the methods model geographical processes and explore the dynamic behavior systems physical and human geography Many thesis could benefit from the rigor the method and the application the software Modeling dynamic systems Forrester Urban Dynamics become feasible even the absence detailed quantitative knowledge Abstract After fifteen years work the world qualitative reasoning according the QSIM viewpoint now described single book Qualitative reasoning one the most vigorous areas artificial intelligence This book presents within conceptually unified theoretical framework body methods that have been developed over the past fifteen years for building and simulating qualitative models physical systems bathtubs tea kettles automobiles the physiology the body chemical processing plants control systems electrical circuits and the like where knowledge that system incomplete The primary tool for this work the author QSIM algorithm which discussed detail Qualitative models are more able than traditional models express states incomplete knowledge about continuous mechanisms Qualitative simulation guarantees find all possible behaviors consistent with the knowledge the model This expressive power and coverage are important problem solving for diagnosis design monitoring and explanation The framework built around the QSIM algorithm for qualitative simulation and the QSIM representation for qualitative differential equations both which are carefully grounded continuous mathematics Qualititative simulation draws wide range mathematical methods keep complete set predictions tractable including the use partial quantitative information Compositional modeling and component connection methods for building qualitative models are also discussed detail Qualitative Reasoning primarily intended for advanced students and researchers its applications Scientists and engineers who have had solid introduction however will able use this book for self instruction qualitative modeling and simulation methods

car driving convenience and most importantly the necessity maintain the safety human passengers The physical properties the actuators dictate maximum allowable rate change for the actuator values Some the physical properties the system are handled the function controlCar however the still needs maintain basic constraints Driving convenience includes such issues the delay between pressing the gas pedal and the beginning acceleration being imperceptible say Safety dictates that certain functions more important than others and places time limits the allowable response times For example when the driver depresses the brake pedal the brakes must applied within for example general requirement that the should use the best approximations for the actuator values that can obtained successive calls controlCar without violating more important requirements The main design decision for your will whether adopt software architecture based polling interrupts perhaps hybrid part your design you should specify hardware configuration for example system that can run your You not need produce full hardware design system suffices draw block diagram and and point out any hardware features that your requires Formulate the constraints that your will deal with timing constraints and priority constraints terms your system Sketch the software structure your this you can use variety diagrams such

system example digits symbols allowed base radix the order the digits significant really the most significant symbol carries the most weight the least significant symbol carries the least weight here binary number system digits symbols allowed base radix each binary digit called BIT the order the digits significant numbering the digits msb lsb where the number digits the number base really base base really base here octal number system digits symbols allowed base radix the order the digits significant base really base base really base here hexadecimal number system digits symbols allowed base radix the order the digits significant hex decimal base really base given all these examples here set formulas for the general case here bit number weighted positional notation given base this the decimal value the summation from TRANSFORMATIONS BETWEEN BASES any base decimal just use the definition give above decimal binary divide decimal value the base until the value example binary octal group into starting least significant symbol the number bits not evenly divisible then add the most significant end write octal digit for each group example binary octal binary octal binary hex just like binary octal group into starting least significant symbol the number bits not evenly divisible then add the most significant end write hex digit for each group example hex binary trivial just write down the bit binary code for each hexadecimal digit example octal binary just like hex binary trivial just write down the bit binary code for each octal digit hex octal steps hex binary octal decimal hex steps decimal binary hex representing nonintegers what range values needed for calculations very large Avogadro number atoms mole mass the earth kilograms speed light meters sec very small charge electron scientific notation way representing rational numbers using integers used commonly represent nonintegers computers exponent number mantissa base mantissa fraction significand base radix point really called radix point for number with decimal base its called decimal point all the constants given above are scientific notation normalization keep unique form for every representable noninteger they are kept NORMALIZED normalized number will follow the following rule precision accuracy and significant digits These terms are often used incorrectly ignored They are important measurement scientific experiment implies certain amount error depending equipment used Significant digits tell about that error For example number given really implies that this number the range which This significant digits really implies that this number the range which This significant digits the number significant digits given number tells about how accurately the number known The larger the number significant digits the better the accuracy Computers calculators more familiar machine have fixed precision matter what accuracy number known they give lots digits number They ignore how many significant digits are involved For example you the operation given that each number has significant digits correct answer calculator will most likely give answer which implies accuracy much higher than possible The result given just the highest precision that the calculator has has knowledge accuracy only precision BINARY FRACTIONS binary point The decimal value calculated the same way for non fractional numbers the exponents are now negative example binary decimal etc converting decimal binary fractions Consider left and right the decimal point separately The stuff the left can converted binary before Use the following algorithm convert the fraction fraction fraction digit left point NON BINARY FRACTIONS same with binary only the base changes radix point The decimal value calculated the same way for non fractional numbers the exponents are now negative example octal approx hexadecimal approx CONVERSION WITH OTHER BASES another base decimal Just plug into the summation base base decimal another base Keep dividing the base same algorithm base base rem base base
