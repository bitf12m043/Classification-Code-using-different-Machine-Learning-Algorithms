appoints academic advisor for each student see Section for information advisor assignment The advisor and student will draw plan study which conforms the following requirements and all with grades least level course Additional graduate level course Six graduate level courses Courses outside Computer Science approved advisor Total graduate student must maintain GPA least and must receive minimum grade and Section Probation and Dismissal has complete description the GPA requirements For the level requirement Topics Seminar courses are acceptable however Readings Research courses and cannot used fulfill the requirement see Appendix strongly advise each candidate take least one the courses that requires substantial programming project complete individual project under Projects undertaken level other courses often lead choice for the student individual topic for the Final Examination described Section student can use graduate transfer credit substitute for these specific requirements However the Graduate Committee must approve the transfer credit acceptance transfer credit the Graduate College alone not enough request approval from the Department student should submit petition the

credit for courses taken undergraduate Students must choose outside electives consultation with advisor expected that the electives will have some quantitative content Generally students may not use graduate courses fulfill this requirement that are cross listed between the Department Computer Science and other departments students can use them however fulfill the sequence within the department Appendix shows list courses recommended electives Any candidate who elects write thesis must identify thesis supervisor and with the supervisor approval identify thesis topic Generally the thesis supervisor will also serve the student academic advisor the student may request change advisors necessary The student with the advisor consent may apply nine semester hours Research for Thesis toward

fulfillment degree requirements Section Probation and Dismissal Students the master program must maintain grade point average GPA least courses leading the degree The GPA calculation will normally include all graduate Computer Science courses and two graduate courses outside Computer Science that are suitable fulfill the outside elective sequence For graduate students admitted regular status

but only for the first two semesters graduate study For student whose GPA falls below the Graduate Committee will place him her academic probation and send notification writing she must bring the GPA the minimum within the next nine semester hours course work dismissed from the program certain cases the Graduate Committee may require the student complete particular course study with particular GPA

her from the Master program The Second Grade Only option applies only undergraduates Therefore computing student GPA the Registrar Office will include both grades for repeated course However when computing student Computer Science GPA for consideration probation the Department includes only the second grade for repeated course Students wishing formal review their dismissal should refer Appendix Dismissal Review Procedure Section Software Engineering Subtrack The Computer Science Department with the Electrical and Computer The Computer Science Department with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department offers special subtrack software engineering within the program either thesis non thesis programs Students completing the subtrack receive special designation their degree and transcript The minimum course requirements for the degree including the subtrack are and all with grades least and the required subtrack courses level course Electives non thesis Program

thesis defense held The Graduate Committee will consult the student advisor and appoint three person thesis committee which administers the thesis defense Thesis Committee and Thesis Supervisor master thesis committee consists least three members the graduate faculty least two whom are members the Computer Science Department The thesis supervisor need not member the Department the rare case that
