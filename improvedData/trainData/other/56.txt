details further explanations related subjects clicking highlighted words The objective this tutorial for you learn what OSA how use OSA model the real world and why using OSA can lead better systems The first part this page explains the general ideas behind and approaches OSA what does when and how does one use what expect and not expect etc The second part explains the individual building blocks from which models are constructed The last part reference material for OSA glossary symbolary and bibliography and URL use markers the text indicate special parts this tutorial indicates the formal basis underlying the OSA model indicates changes from the book Object Oriented Systems Analysis indicates that the concepts are somewhat tentative that that the developers are not happy with and likely change indicates comparisons with other systems analysis techniques and object oriented languages The Philosophy OSA OSA objected oriented systems analysis technique which understand the study specific domain interacting objects for the purpose understanding and documenting their essential characteristics has the expressive power represent reality Its underlying concepts are based formal definitions system data and behavior modeling Object oriented Process oriented analysis Process oriented analysis describes systems network interacting processes includes descriptions data used processes which are recorded data dictionary This approach often steers the analyst away from studying system components and their interrelationships towards studying how the system might designed and implemented also difficult for process oriented analysis map concepts between network processes and objects existing real world system opposed process oriented analysis object oriented analysis modularizes analysis document along the same object boundaries that exist real world system addition this approach also organizes all knowledge about each system object single logical location the analysis document Thus information about system object easier locate object oriented analysis than other analysis methods The object oriented approach also encourages analysts concentrate what rather than how which reduces the temptation skip prematurely design make easier understand information about objects object oriented techniques provide forms abstraction including aggregation generalization and classification Model driven Method driven analysis method driven approach consists fixed sequence steps follow That system developed some method such the waterfall method the spiral model practice these steps cannot followed exactly When development problems are encountered the analyst must adjust the order steps adapt the procedures and make exceptions rules The analyst left rely experience and underlying principles which may undocumented and are poorly understood model driven technique the other hand provides prespecified set fundamental concepts with which model the system under study This aids analysts building models best suits their needs The philosophy the model driven technique that the most important thing learn not step step procedure but rather the conceptual framework behind the analysis technique Reality Representation OSA model designed with the idea that reality represented instead some particular programming language Modeling components have been designed allow analysts capture everything importance system Thus OSA encourages analysts represent systems the way they are perceived without being constrained how will implemented Formal Basis The underlying concepts OSA are based formal definitions system data and behavior modeling Analysis through the construction system models whose modeling constructs are based formal definitions helpful for the following reasons Models based formal definitions can provide foundation for testing model integrity and completeness analysis Since formal model definition ensures consistent interpretation can provide mechanism for communicating system understanding within the analysis team model with formal foundation can also improve communication with parties outside the analysis team The Components OSAOSA has concepts formalize just about everything one needs model real world situation Although OSA integrated modeling scheme that all the parts work together can conveniently seen consisting three parts ORM OBM and OIM ORM Object Relationship Model The ORM Object Relationship Model way describe represent objects classes object relationships between objects and classes and memberships the real world The ORM consists Objects Object Classes Lexical Object Classes Relational Object Classes High Level Object Classes Relationships Relationship Sets and the special forms Generalization Specialization Roles Aggregation Association Constraints Participation Constraints occurrence Constraints Object class Cardinality Constraints Specialization Constraints General Constraints High Level Relationship Sets and Notes OBM Object Behavior Model The OBM Object Behavior Model means describing the behavior objects means explaining object possible states informally what may and how and why changes state The OBM may thought detailing when and how objects join and leave object classes and relationships The OBM consists States Transitions Triggers Conditions and Events Actions Initial Transitions Final Transitions Exceptions Prior States Subsequent States Threads Real Time Constraints General Constraints for Behaviors High Level States High Level Transitions and Generalization Specialization OIM Object Interaction Model Under construction The OIM consists Specifying Interacting Objects Interacting with Multiple Objects Bidirectional Interaction Special Interactions Access Modify Remove and Destroy Add and Create Continuous Interaction Time Constrained Interactions General Constraints for Interactions Interaction Within Object Class High Level Interactions and Views and Generalization Specialization References This section gives references which may helpful while reading OSA models using OSA build models Glossary The glossary alphabetical list OSA terms Each entry has brief definition link the main defining page and links related terms Symbolary The symbolary list the symbols used the graphical representation OSA diagrams Bibliography The bibliography list
