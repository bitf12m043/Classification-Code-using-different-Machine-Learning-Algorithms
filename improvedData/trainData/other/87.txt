features common modern programming languages are popular because they simplify the development efficient programs The first the assignment statement allows the components data structure redefined computation progresses The second dynamic allocation allows memory for data structures acquired destroyed and reused need The third the reference pointer variable allows multiple data structures share common substructure These three features unfortunately make difficult estimate program behavior compile time Such estimates play crucial role the automatic improvement modification and reuse existing
