provide rigorous methods for reasoning about distributed programs The topics are Distributed detection algorithms Distributed resource allocation Logical clocks Global snapshot Logics for reasoning about distributed algorithms Safety and progress Program composition Distributed program construction Discussion Sessions The discussion sessions will allow discuss topics presented class detail and occasion cover background material Weekly handouts containing exercises will distributed class and the Web and selected solutions will presented during the discussion sessions You only need attend one the weekly sessions both cover the same material Study Groups recommend that you organize yourselves into study groups five six students who meet once week discuss the course You should review the lectures the readings and attempt the homework assignments before meeting group Grading systemFirst exam Second exam Third exam Exams October Sachez Building SZB from November Garrison GAR from

Content length Arizona Computer Science Financial AidFinancial Aid There are limited number half time assistantships available through the Department Computer Science Students with Teaching Assistantships lead course discussion sections assist faculty managing courses Students with Research Assistantships work research projects within the Department International students are eligible hold assistantship positions All assistantship positions pay variable salary based degree program and addition come with out state tuition waiver Application forms are included with the admissions packet Completed assistantship applications and letters recommendation should returned with other application materials February for fall applicants and August for spring applicants Occasionally additional assistantships become available later the year Applications received after the above deadlines are held for consideration should such openings materialize addition the assistantship positions there are limited number Graduate College Tuition Scholarships and Graduate College Registration Scholarships These scholarships waive either the tuition registration fees depending which type awarded International students are also eligible for these awards formal application necessary All incoming students are automatically considered for these scholarships This department receives great number applications each semester making all financial aid awards highly competitive cannot assess applicant chances receiving admission and financial aid until receive completed application and all required supporting documents addition not possible predict the number available assistantships future semester The amount financial assistance available new students varies each semester and determined various factors including the number current students completing their degrees The criteria for assistantship are comparable that admission our PhD program high scores standardized tests adequate background computer science strong letters recommendation good grades from strong undergraduate program and research interests shared with the faculty Top Page Department Home Page http www

Due Monday September before Homework Due Wednesday October the beginning class ProgramPurpose This program intended provide understanding the area data representation Program Statement For user entering data program any base could used for either input output often assume that the base ten but would not have Write SAL program where the user enters base ten integers The first one will the base use for input the second one will the base use for output and the third will the integer The program prints out the user entered integer the user entered base Write the code such that the user entered base will the range base Sample program run Enter the input base Enter base for printing the integer Enter the integer The integer base Another sample program run Enter the input base Enter base for printing the integer Enter the integer The integer base RequirementsUse procedures functions defined chapter the text There should one procedure that reads user entered integer and another that displays integer any base All input and output except for the use puts for displaying strings done using character oriented input and output That means that the operand for put and get instructions may only type character declared byte The easiest way enforce this requirement use the SAL putc and getc instructions instead put and get error user input detected have the program print out error message and exit Note that since the program will doing input and output character character there are many user input errors that can detected Errors that should handled include checking that the user entered bases are the correct range and detecting user entered characters that could not part integer Write the program such that runs once and then exits not incorporate loop execute the program more than once Comment your SAL program appropriately Handing the Program Turn your program the SAL source code only once running the scripthandin program where program the name the file containing the SAL program The handin script submits your program for you printout will turned Homework points Give base representation the base value Show your work points Fill the missing entries the following table Use six bits for the binary representations the value required does not fit write overflow for the answer Decimal Sign Magnitude One Complement Two Complement points Show all work giving the IEEE single precision floating point representation for the decimal value Truncate the repeating fraction its least significant end Express the result hexadecimal points What decimal value represented the IEEE single precision floating point representation given hexadecimal points The SAL puts instruction used print out the string that starts label string The contents memory given hexadecimal are given address contents string string What printed the puts instruction
