game Hangman this game you try guess secret word phrase one letter time you guess all the letters the word before making certain number mistakes you win What For this assignment you will need combine the code that you write with some code provided your instructor This provided code consists two parts The string class which allows you easily create and manipulate string objects Two functions described below order use these provided files you will link them with your source code This means that several source code files are combined into single executable Even programs and your source code was linked with the standard library enabling you for example print the screen The exact steps involved setting this linking process depend the compiler and environment you are using The Vectra Lab Borland Outside the Vectra Lab Using GNU Any Other Environment The Vectra Lab you are doing all your work the lab then use the following steps Remember ask consultant you have trouble with these instructions Run Borland Create project file choosing Project New from the menu This brings window prompting you for the name the project Erase whatever there and type prog dot three letter extension Also make sure that EasyWin and not Application selected from the list below Then click the Advanced button which brings yet another window Here remove the checkmark the file and def file lines Then click twice once for the Advanced window and again the New Target window Add the files for the string class and the functions your project this first click the line prog exe the Project Window should now highlighted Then hit the Insert key and type the file name public mbirk string obj not enter the quotation marks Now click the prog exe line again hit the Insert key and type public mbirk prog fun obj Make sure you type these exactly shown When you are done the prog exe line should have three files hanging from prog func obj string obj and prog cpp Double click the prog cpp line bring blank editor window this window type the following test program include iostream include public mbirk string string random secret phrase bool char string char string string int main cout random secret phrase endl return When you run this program should print single random phrase and quit You can now use this program shell template for the hangman program Note The next time you run Borland order work Program you will need Project Open not File Open Then select prog ide from the file selection window Borland Outside the Vectra Lab you are using Borland home some other site than the Vectra Lab then read the instructions above They are correct except that you cannot access the files the drive Instead you will have download the cpp and files note that the Makefile and CVS directory won used and save them your working directory Note that these files are source files ending cpp and instead object files ending obj that Then when creating the project eliminate the prefix public mbirk and replace all the obj suffixes with cpp Note you are using Borland there minor incompatibilty Edit the defs file and remove comment out all lines with the word bool This because has the bool type built but does not Using GNU The process for using very different First you need download the source files Download all six files ignore the CVS directory Then test these files typing make the directory which contains them should compile the program executable prog Test typing prog will print single secret phrase and exit Now you can use prog cpp basis for the assignment each time you want compile type make Any Other Environment you are using any other environment such Microsoft Visual Turbo you may need some extra work This because don have access these environments can test them out You can try the following download the source files Consult your instructions how set projectt and add the three cpp files this project You may need modify the defs file you can get work ask you still can get work you will have the Vectra Lab Using the string Class The string class allows you treat strings sequences characters like built types even though they not String literal constants are quotes and you can define string variables assign one string another print strings the screen etc For example string first name John string last name Doe cout Hello first name last name addition you can add two strings together with the operator This called concatenation string name first name last name cout name endl prints John Doe name same name name cout name endl prints John Doe find out how long string use the length member function For example string name cout What your name cin name cout Your name name length characters long You can also access individual characters the string using the square brackets Inside the brackets put integer expression that evaluates the index the character you are interested These indices start not string test Test cout test prints char test access all the characters string use the square brackets inside loop For this you need know how long the string use the length member function for this Also note that you can modifiy the characters string using the brackets For example convert string all uppercase you could the following for int some string length some string toupper some string Using the Provided Functions order hone your function calling expertise providing you with two functions that you must use for program These functions are the following string random secret phrase Returns string that random secret phrase use the hangman game Note that his function has parameters inputs just return value output bool char string char string string Returns true the character the string false otherwise For example char string xyz returns true which char string Hello returns false What Hand always hand printed copy both your source code and the output displayed when the program run For the output you should run the program three times and hand the printed output for all three least run should show you correctly guessing the secret phrase and another should show you running out chances Note don forget have your program print your name and section number that they show all your printouts Sample Program Output Here are some sample program outputs Note few things Only letters are guessed spaces and punctuation come for free The program checks for errors input characters which aren letters aren allowed Also you can guess the same letter twice You only lose one your five chances you guess incorrect letter that you haven guessed before Upper case and lower case letters are not distinguished guessing capital for instance matches all lower case letters the secret phrase The program plays one game hangman and then quits print double quotation mark your program precede the double quote with backslash inside string literal constant cout name mud Welcome John Doe Hangman program You have five chances guess the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Sorry that letter not the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Sorry that letter not the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Sorry that letter not the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Sorry that letter not the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Sorry that letter not the secret phrase Secret phrase Sorry you ran out chances The secret phrase was java Welcome John Doe Hangman program You have five chances guess the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Sorry that letter not the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter That not letter Try again chances left Enter letter Sorry that letter not the secret phrase Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase tai chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase tain chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase tain chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase Captain chances left Enter letter You already guessed that letter Try again chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase Captain Kan chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase Captain Kanga chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase Captain Kangar chances left Enter letter Good guess Secret phrase Captain Kangaroo Congratulations You guessed the secret phrase mbirk wisc edu
