preference values used implement load balancing scheme for incoming electronic mail This assignment requires using ftp connect machines outside the Department firewall There are two options for this Use ncftp new interface the ftp client automatically starts connection anonymous user mode that you not have type user names and mail addresses also requests that the peer machine use passive mode when transfering data thereby allowing data flow back over the already established TCP connection and avoiding problems with the firewall the remote ftp server does not support passive mode something indicated you not get any response dir get request you will have resort the second option Use ftp connect the firewall machine cornell edu When the program asks for user name respond with anonymous remote machine but replacing remote machine with the name the machine you want reach The firewall proxy server will then setup control connection and manage any future incoming data connections for your When password asked not type your own password but instead type your mail address More information can found the tips firewall manual page MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content
