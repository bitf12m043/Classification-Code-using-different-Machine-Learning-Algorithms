For the Blind RFB organized two day symposium May providing persons with print impairments improved access mathematical and scientific documents Here the initial call for participation describing the goals this symposium AsTeR Audio System for Technical Readings enables automatic production audio documents This can result tremendous savings both time and effort providing alternative access technical documents and thereby increase the availability such documents accessible form The interactive nature AsTeR also enables the user interact far more effectively with such documents The conference focused how AsTeR could moved from being research system one that could Produce books tape Provide interactive reading machine system for students achieve this AsTeR needs ported other computing platforms Produce educational material Braille Here are the official proceedings from the conference Here short trip report describing the outcome the conference executive summary the conference well comments are also available raman cornell edu Last modified Wed Jun MIME Version Server CERN Date Wednesday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last Modified Tuesday Mar GMT

Operating Systems SunOS Solaris BSD DOS Languages Pascal Lisp assembly Databases Worked Oracle and Sybase Past Projects database for library management using Oracle RDBMS Included were provisions for maintaining details faculty students and employees Retrieval and updation was made possible through friendly user interface implemented using SQL Forms Implementation some the routing algorithms for the Network Layer This was done part project develop layered protocol suite confirming the OSI model compiler for subset the Pascal programming language using the compiler building tools lex and yacc mathematical package for scientific use This included matrix operations curve fitting interpolation integration calculator graph plotter solving equations using Newton Raphson method solving simultaneous linear equations fft among others Among the facilities provided were friendly user interface and editing loading and saving files Design based card that receives data from serial port and transfers data parallel printer port Centronics interface have done the following DOS environment memory testing worm that checks segment replicating itself utility which provides file transfer talk between two connected serial port with friendly interface set the baudrate and other parameters restricted DOS like operating system using BIOS calls comes before DOS and provides monitor for viewing

gnats That means that everyone has access the paradise gnats database where the problem records are kept There are things you can with gnats report problems query the problem database and edit problems Gnats provides command line tools for all these things Reporting Problems Problems are reported using the send program you run paradise gnats bin send you will find yourself the editor with problem report template You can edit the template and then write quit send the report gnats NOTE You can try out the system reporting problem within the test category Querying the Problem Database You can query the problem database using the query program Using WebGnatsWebGnats Web based interface the gnats reporting and query programs You can most everything you need through the WebGnats interface Problem reporting web gnats handled through html form Each problem category can have its own form This allows different questions posed for bug reports concerning different parts the system order edit problems you need running WebGnats from workstation with AFS access and you need have the following your mailcap file application problem edit paradise gnats bin problem edit Emacs You can use gnats from within emacs loading the gnats emacs interfaces The files are located paradise gnats lib emacs lisp Look the file gnats that directory for configuration instructions Curt Ellmann Paradise Project
