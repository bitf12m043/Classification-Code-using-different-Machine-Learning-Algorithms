files Descriptionsubmit looks for submittable files the current working directory and recursively searches thorugh all directories within that directory ignoring all binary and potential backup files Upon confirmation from the user submit copies archives and compresses files and stores them privately the class account Mail confirming the files submitted sent the user you resubmit assignment your old assignment moved backup location you resubmit more than once only your last two submissions will kept You will asked whether you really want resubmit your assignment number can used with the option specify particular homework which being submitted forced files are forced into submission even they would ordinarily ignored Usually the user will not need specify forced files assignment number The submit program will submit the current due assignment the not specified Options Help option Shows options for the program Does NOT perform submission Submit certain assignment other than the one currently due NotesIt generally good idea create separate subdirectory for each your homeworks these homework directories will any makefiles READMEs sources files header files and sample executions submit these files just run submit from within the corresponding homework directory Return ValuesUpon successful submission the user notified via email the successfully submitted files Upon failure the user instructed notify the submit administrator the error codes Files bin submit bin submit public html submit html lib submission log ExampleWarningsBe sure machine the CUNIX cluster Because incredible loads the CUNIX cluster close submission times you should leave yourself ample minutes time submit your assignments The running time the program should less than minute for normal sized submissions Deadlines are enforced the submission program and timing enforced the CUNIX cluster machines clock Not your watch cluster machines All submissions are logged CreditsCoded Min Yen Kan
