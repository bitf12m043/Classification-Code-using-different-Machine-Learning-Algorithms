has followed around Summus non Americae The Canadian National Motto BUGS the PIPELINE stupid Andy Glew Expressing observation that many bugs were caused incorrect design one dimensional pipelines not the multi pipeline decoupled nature The title talk gave the IEEE Asilomar Conference need more formal methods for the straightforward design pipelines Bypasses just say Andy Glew ArchitectA Micro Architect Robert Geva You will not able see this without HTML supporting the BIG and SMALL HTML commands Measure twice cut once This Old House Virtual something that isn there but appears Transparent something that there but doesn appear times profound change the learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped deal with world that longer exists Rogers Global SchoolHouse Network speaking CUE Glew comment wonder there some correlation between liberal and ability learn and adapt new things that liberalism trait that has survival advantage times rapid change but which less advantage during the long intervals less change The computer industry may act example profoundly liberal when started conservative now that the time great innovations and new ideas has passed The most important facts programming There are numbers the set not paraphrased from Stan Kelly Bootle Any programming problem can solved adding level indirection Unknown Any performance problem can solved removing level indirection Mike Haertel Compiled Mike Haertel What the single most important fact Computer Science The fact that there are elements the set Stan Kelly Bootle Names are scarce resource Andy Glew ain broke find something else fix Tim Olson AMD The worst maxim around Don fix ain broke You better improving because your competitor Wayne Calloway Pepsico CEO FORTUNE April All great ideas eventually degenerate hardware Peter Drucker The poor ideas remain software Computer memory requirements are growing address bit months IBM your users don cost more than the appropriate computers you should get better users unless they are grad students andy polya stanford edu Justification for running emacs Cray ALWAYS code reused Because then your code can reused Saying that this code will never reused and coding that way self fulfilling prophecy Andy Glew There has never been good product designed committee Keep decade behind all for simplicity very complicated can understandit Parity for farmers Seymour Cray Now that have taught you how avoid division the next time will teach you how avoid multiplication Seymour Cray talking numerical analysts Let make smart machines run slower software faster Bob Campbell beaver tikal bobc Flon axiom There does not now nor will there ever exist programming language which the least bit hard write bad programs Development maintenance Brian Marick you really want this question that should never asked unless there chance that the answer Otherwise you are asked this question times day answering Yes the time will have you answering out habit The axiom Systemantics When fail safe system fails fails failing fail safe John Gall Systemantics Scientific applications grow factor every years Giles Perfection the enemy the dissertation Ivan Sutherland Perfection the enemy completion Andy Glew all else fails follow the instructions Read the instructions bearing mind they probably fucked anyway Andy Glew Indirection the right direction Andy Glew Never put off until run time what can done compile time You wouldn believe the shit got from late binding advocates the first time posted this Gould newsgroup Andy Glew Never put off until execution time what can done decode time Andy Glew Recurses Called again Recurse you Mad Baron easier apologize than ask permission Grace Hopper need coalition stamp out smart devices Chris Torek Most smart controllers are fact smart ass controllers Rob Pike paraphrased educated man knows synonym for every concept The Titanic Effect The severity with which system fails proportional the intensity the designers belief that cannot the early ROM was equal bits register space What reason for microcode Info from Patterson Instructions should not bind together operations which optimizing compiler might otherwise choose separate order produce more efficient program Brian Case just shift the left And then shift the ght Get load those MIPS And the code real ight This lockstep pipeline Really drives insa ane Let the pre charge again Brian Case Measurement repetition not equivalent repetition measurement Eugene Miya The best the enemy the good RISC Relegates Important Stuff Compilers The maxim Nothing avails but perfection may spelled Winston Churchill Turning off the type and range checking after the program debugged like throwing away the lifeboats after the maiden voyage like travelling without convoy through submarine war zone The biggest and most common mistake computer design not providing enough address bits Bell and Mudge Evolution PDP Rules Thumb Every years transistor account chip increases Every years chip speed increases Every years DRAMs increase size Every years DRAMs get faster Every years Disks increase size Every years Disks get faster main memory required for every MIP way Disproved microcomputers bandwidth required feed every MIP Programmers increase the size programs every year UNIX International May Rule for debugging When doubt
