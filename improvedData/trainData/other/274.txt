helminthiasis infestation with disease caused parasitic worms the Internet that was unleashed the evening November This RFC provides information about event that occurred the life the Internet This memo does not specify any standard Distribution this memo unlimited Introduction The obscure see eventually the completely apparent takes longer Edward Murrow The helminthiasis the Internet was self replicating program that infected VAX computers and SUN workstations running the and Berkeley UNIX code disrupted the operations computers accessing known security loopholes applications closely associated with the operating system Despite system administrators efforts eliminate the program the infection continued attack and spread other sites across the United States This RFC provides glimpse the infection its festering and cure The impact the worm the Internet community ethics statements the role the news media crime the computer world and future prevention will discussed documentation review presents four publications that describe detail this particular parasitic computer program Reference and bibliography sections are also included this memo The Infection Sandworms hate right Michael Keaton Beetlejuice Defining worm versus virus worm program that can run independently will consume the resources its host from within order maintain itself and can propagate complete working version itself other machines Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December virus piece code that inserts itself into host including operating systems propagate cannot run independently requires that its host program run activate the early stages the helminthiasis the news media popularly cited the Internet worm virus which was attributed early conclusion some the computer community before specimen the worm could extracted and dissected There are some computer scientists that still argue over what call the affliction this RFC use the term worm Infection The Worm Attacks The worm specifically and only made successful attacks SUN workstations and VAXes running Berkeley UNIX code The Internet worm relied the several known access loopholes order propagate over networks relied implementation errors two network programs sendmail and fingerd Sendmail program that implements the Internet electronic mail services routing and delivery interacting with remote sites The feature sendmail that was violated was non standard debug command The worm propagated itself via the debug command into remote hosts the worm installed itself new host the new instance began self replicating Fingerd utility program that intended help remote Internet users supplying public information about other Internet users This can the form identification the full name login name any local user whether not they are logged the time see the Finger Protocol Using fingerd the worm initiated memory overflow situation sending too many characters for fingerd accommodate the gets library routine Upon overflowing the storage space the worm was able execute small arbitrary program Only BSD VAX machines suffered from this attack Another the worm methods was exploit the trusted host features often used local networks propagate using rexec and rsh also infected machines etc hosts equiv machines rhosts machines cracked accounts forward files machines cracked accounts rhosts files machines listed network gateways routing tables machines the far end point Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December point interfaces and other machines randomly guessed addresses networks first hop gateways The Internet worm was also able infect systems using guessed passwords typically spreading itself within local networks this method tried guess passwords and upon gaining access the worm was able pose legitimate user Festering Password Cracking The worm festered going into password cracking phase attempting access accounts with obvious passwords using clues readily available the etc passwd file such none all the user name the user name appended itself the nickname the last name the last name spelled backwards also tried breaking into into accounts with passwords from personalized word dictionary and accounts with passwords usr dict words Most users encountered slowing their programs the systems became overloaded trying run many copies the worm program lack file space many copies the worm temporary files existed concurrently Actually the worm was very careful hide itself and leave little evidence its passage through system The users the infected sites may have seen strange files that showed the usr tmp directories some machines and obscure messages appeared the log files sendmail The Cure Teams computer science students and staff worked feverishly understand the worm The key was seen get source language version the program Since the only isolated instances the the worm were binary code major effort was made translate back source that decompile the code and study just what damage the worm was capable Two specific teams emerged the battle against the Internet worm the Berkeley Team and the MIT team They communicated and exchanged code extensively Both teams were able scrutinize and take immediate action cure and prevent reinfection Just like regular medical Doctors the teams searched found and isolated worm specimen which they could study Upon analyzing the specimen and the elements its design they set about develop methods treat and defeat Through the use the old boy network UNIX system wizards find out something one asks associate friend they know the answer who else they could refer find out the answer email and phone calls were extensively used alert the computer world the program patches that could used sites close the sendmail hole and Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December fingerd holes Once the information was disseminated the sites and these holes were patched the Internet worm was stopped could not reinfect the same computers again unless the worm was still sitting infected trusted host computer The Internet worm was eliminated from most computers within hours after had appeared specifically through the efforts computer science staffs the University research centers Government and Commercial agencies apparently were slow coming around recognizing the helminthiasis and eradicating Impact Off with his head The Red Queen Alice Wonderland Two lines have been drawn the computer community the aftermath the Internet worm November One group contends that the release the worm program was naive accident and that the worm escaped during testing Yet when the worm program was unleashed was obvious was spreading unchecked Another group argues that the worm was deliberately released blatantly point out security defects community that was aware the problems but were complacent about fixing them Yet one does not necessarily need deliberately disrupt the entire world order report problem Both groups agree that the community cannot condone worm infestation whether experimental deliberate means heighten public awareness the consequences such irresponsible acts can devastating Meanwhile several the news media stated that the author the worm did the computer community favor exposing the security flaws and that bugs and security flaws will not get fixed without such drastic measures the Internet worm program the short term the worm program did heighten the computer community awareness security flaws Also the old boy network proved was still alive and well While networking and computers whole have grown leaps and bounds the last twenty years the Internet community still has the old boys who trust and communicate well with each other the face adversity the long term all results the helminthiasis are not complete Many sites have either placed restrictions access their machines and few have chosen remove themselves from the Internet entirely The legal consequences the Internet worm program computer crime are still pending and may stay that condition into the next decade Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December Yet the problem computer crime layman level social one Legal statutes which notoriously are legislated after the fact are only one element the solution Development enforceable ethical standards that are universally agreed the computer community coupled with enforceable laws should help eradicate computer crime Ethics and the Internet you going play the game properly you better know every rule Barbara Jordan Ethical behavior that conforming accepted professional standards conduct dealing with what good bad within set moral principles values until recently most computer professionals and groups have not been overly concerned with questions ethics Organizations and computer professional groups have recently the aftermath the Internet worm issued their own Statement Ethics Ethics statements published the Internet Activities Board IAB the National Science Foundation NSF the Massachusetts Institute Technology MIT and the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility CPSR are discussed below The IAB The IAB issued statement policy concerning the proper use the resources the Internet January and reprinted the Communications the ACM June excerpt The Internet national facility whose utility largely consequence its wide availability and accessibility Irresponsible use this critical resource poses enormous threat its continued availability the technical community The Government sponsors this system have fiduciary responsibility the public allocate government resources wisely and effectively Justification for the support this system suffers when highly disruptive abuses occur Access and use the Internet privilege and should treated such all users this system The IAB strongly endorses the view the Division Advisory Panel the National Science Foundation Division Network Communications Research and Infrastructure which paraphrase characterized unethical and unacceptable any activity which purposely Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December seeks gain unauthorized access the resources the Internet disrupts the intended use the Internet wastes resources people capacity computer through such actions destroys the integrity computer based information and compromises the privacy users The Internet exists the general research milieu Portions continue used support research and experimentation networking Because experimentation the Internet has the potential affect all its components and users researchers have the responsibility exercise great caution the conduct their work Negligence the conduct Internet wide experiments both irresponsible and unacceptable The IAB plans take whatever actions can concert with Federal agencies and other interested parties identify and set technical and procedural mechanisms make the Internet more resistant disruption Such security however may extremely expensive and may counterproductive inhibits the free flow information which makes the Internet valuable the final analysis the health and well being the Internet the responsibility its users who must uniformly guard against abuses which disrupt the system and threaten its long term viability NSF The NSF issued ethical network use statement November during the regular meeting the Division Advisory Panel for Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure and reprinted the Communications the ACM June that stated part The Division Advisory Panel DAP the NSF Division Networking and Communication Research and Infrastructure DNCRI deplores lapses ethical behavior which cause disruption our national network resources Industry government and academe have established computer networks support research and scholarship Recent events have accentuated the importance establishing community standards for the ethical use networks this regard the DNCRI DAP defines unethical any activity which purposefully through negligence Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December disrupts the intended use the networks wastes resources through such actions people bandwidth computer destroys the integrity computer based information compromises the privacy users consumes unplanned resources for control and eradication encourage organizations managing and operating networks adopt and publicize policies and standards for ethical behavior also encourage these organizations adopt administrative procedures enforce appropriate disciplinary responses violations and work with appropriate bodies drafting legislation this area MIT MIT issued statement ethics entitled Teaching Students About Responsible Use Computers and reprinted the Communications the ACM June The official statement ethics specifically outlined MIT position the intended use privacy and security system integrity and intellectual property rights Those standards outlined the MIT Bulletin under academic procedures call for all members the community act responsible ethical and professional way The members the MIT community also carry the responsibility use the system accordance with MIT standards honesty and personal conduct CPSR The CPSR issued statement the Computer Virus November and reprinted the Communications the ACM June The CPSR believes The incident should prompt critical review our dependence complex computer networks particularly for military and defense related function The flaws that permitted the recent virus spread will eventually fixed but other flaws will remain Security loopholes are inevitable any computer network and are prevalent those that support general purpose computing and are widely accessible effective way correct known security flaws publish Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December descriptions the flaws that they can corrected therefore view the effort conceal technical descriptions the recent virus short sighted CPSR believes that innovation creativity and the open exchange ideas are the ingredients scientific advancement and technological achievement Computer networks such the Internet facilitate this exchange cannot afford policies that might restrict the ability computer researchers exchange their ideas with one another More secure networks such military and financial networks sharply restrict access and offer limited functionality Government industry and the university community should support the continued development network technology that provides open access many users The computer virus has sent clear warning the computing community and society large hope will provoke long overdue public discussion about the vulnerabilities computer networks and the technological ethical and legal choices must address The Role the Media You don worry about whether not they written you worry whether not they read before they the air Linda Ellerbee the Pat Sajak Show Airplane accidents Pit Bulldog attacks drought disease the media there whether you want them there not Predictably some members the press grabbed the worm invasion the Internet and sensationalized the outbreak Sites were named including sites like NASA Ames and Lawrence Livermore and pointed being violated Questions computer security were rampant Questions national security appropriately followed The alleged perpetrator the worm tended thought the press genius hero During the helminthiasis the Internet handling this news media invasion was critical akin trying extinguish major brush fire with news reporter and microphone your way Time the essence The Berkeley group among others reported that was problem get work accomplished with the press hounding them incessantly MIT their news office was commended doing their job keeping the press informed and satisfied yet out the way the students and staff working the cure What appropriate response MIT even carefully worded Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December technical statement the press resulted very few coherent press releases the Internet worm Extrapolation and flavoring the press were common According Eichin and Rochlis were unable show the crew anything visual caused the virus something which eventually become common media request and disappointment Instead they settled for people looking workstations talking computer talk Cornell University was very critical the press their report the Provost The Commission suggests that media exaggeration the value and technical sophistication this kind activity obscures the far more accomplished work those students who complete their graduate studies without public fanfare who make constructive contributions computer sciences and the advancement knowledge through their patiently constructed dissertation and who subject their work the close scrutiny and evaluation their peers and not the interpretations the popular press Crime the Computer World recent survey the American Bar Association found that almost one half those companies and Government agencies that responded had been victimized some form computer crime The known financial loss from those crimes was estimated high million and the report concluded that computer crime among the worst white collar offenses The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act The term White Collar crime was first used Edwin Sutherland noted American criminologist Sutherland contended that the popular view crime primarily lower class Blue Collar activity was based the failure consider the activities the robber barons and captains industry who violated the law with virtual impunity this day and age White Collar crime refers violations the law committed salaried professional persons conjunction with their work Computer crimes are identified and included this classification Yet law enforcement agencies have historically paid little attention this new phenomenon When trial and conviction does occur resulted more often fine and probation than prison term shift became apparent the late when the FBI ABSCAM investigation resulted the conviction several legislators for bribery and related charges The legal implication the Internet worm program computer crime still pending there are few cases rely the Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December Federal level The Computer Virus Eradication Act Herger Carr was introduced the House Representatives the State level several states are considering their own statutes Time will tell Meanwhile computer network security still allegedly being compromised described recent DDN Security Bulletin Future Prevention This pretty kettle fish Queen Mary Stanley Baldwin the time Edward VII abdication What roles can the computer community whole play preventing such outbreaks Why were many people aware the debug problem the sendmail program and the overflow problem fingerd yet appropriate fixes were not installed existing systems Various opinions have emerged Computer ethics must taken seriously standard for computer ethics extremely important for the new groups computer professionals graduating out Universities The old professionals and new professionals who use computers are ALL responsible for their applications The powers that the Internet IAB DARPA NSF etc should pursue the current problems network security and cause the flaws fixed The openness and free flow information networking should rightfully preserved demonstrated its worth during the helminthiasis expediting the analysis and cure the infestation Promote and coordinate the establishment committees agency police panels that would handle judge and enforce violations based universally set standard computer ethics The continued incidences computer crime show lack professionalism and ethical standards the computer community Ethics statements like those discussed this RFC not only need published but enforced well There continuing need instill professional code ethics and responsibilities order preserve the computer community Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December Documentation Review Everybody wants get into the act Jimmy Durante Quite number articles and papers were published very soon after the worm invasion Books articles and other documents are continuing written and published the subject see Section Bibliography this RFC have chosen four review The Cornell University Report The Computer Worm presented the Provost the University Eichin and Rochlis With Microscope and Tweezers Analysis the Internet Virus November Donn Seeley Tour the Worm and Gene Spafford The Internet Worm Program Analysis The Cornell University Report The Cornell University Report The Computer Worm was presented the Provost the University February the Commission Preliminary Enquiry consisting Ted Eisenberg Law David Gries Computer Science Juris Hartmanis Computer Science Don Holcomb Physics Stuart Lynn Office Information Technologies Chair and Thomas Santoro Office the University Counsel introduction set the stage the intent and purpose the Commission Accumulate all evidence concerning the involvement the alleged Cornell University Computer Science graduate student the worm infestation the Internet and assess the gathered evidence determine the alleged graduate student was the perpetrator Accumulate all evidence concerning the potential involvement any other members the Cornell University community and assess such evidence determine whether not any other members the Cornell University community was involved unleashing the worm the Internet knew the potential worm infestation ahead time Evaluate relevant computer policies and procedures determine which any were violated and make preliminary recommendations the Provost whether any such policies and procedures should modified inhibit potential future security violations this general type Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December the summary findings and comments the Commission named the Cornell University first year Computer Science graduate student that allegedly created the worm and unleashed the Internet The findings section also discussed the impact the invasion the worm the mitigation attempts stop the worm the violation computer abuse policies the intent security attitudes and knowledge technical sophistication Cornell involvement ethical considerations community sentiment and Cornell University policies computer abuse The report concluded that the worm program gathering unauthorized passwords and the dissemination the worm over national network were wrong The Commission also disclaimed that contrary media reports Cornell University DID NOT condone the worm infection nor heralded the unleashing the worm program heroic event The Commission did continue encourage the free flow scholarly research and reasonable trust within the University Research communities background the worm program methods investigation introduction the evidence interpretation and findings acknowledgements and extensive appendices were also included the Commission report With Microscope and Tweezers Analysis the Internet Virus November Eichin and Rochlis With Microscope and Tweezers Analysis the Internet Virus November provides detailed dissection the worm program The paper discusses the major points the worm program then reviews strategies chronology lessons and open issues acknowledgements also included are detailed appendix the worm program subroutine subroutine appendix the cast characters and reference section discussion the terms worm versus virus presented These authors concluded that was virus infection not worm infection Thus they use the term virus their document Section goals and targets the teams computer scientists were defined There were three steps taken find out the inner workings the virus Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December isolating specimen the virus form which could analyzed decompiling the virus into form that could shown reduce the executable the real things that the higher level version could interpreted analyzing the strategies used the virus and the elements its design order find weaknesses and methods defeating Major points were outlined how the virus attacked and who attacked How entered Who attacked What attacked What did NOT Section the target the attacks the virus were discussed This included the sendmail debug mode the finger daemon bug rexec and passwords rsh trusted host features and information flow description the virus self protection included how covered its tracks and what camouflage used undetected the machines and system administrators Flaws were analyzed three subjects reinfection prevention heuristics and vulnerabilities not used Many defenses were launched stop the virus Some were convenient inconvenient for end users the infected systems Those mentioned this document included full isolation from the network turning off mail service patching out the debug command sendmail shutting down the finger daemon fixing the finger daemon mkdir usr tmp simple way keep the virus from propagating Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December defining pleasequit did not stop the virus renaming the UNIX compiler and linker requiring new passwords for all users After the virus was diagnosed tool was created which duplicated the password attack including the virus internal directory and was posted the Internet System administrators were able analyze the passwords use their system Section chronicles the events that took place between Wednesday November through Friday November EST Section lessons and open issues are viewed and discussed Connectivity was important The old boy network worked Late night authentication interesting problem How did you know that really MIT the phone Whom you call you need talk the manager the Ohio State University network clock the morning Speaker phones and conference calling proved very useful The teams that were formed and how they reacted the virus topic for future study Misinformation and illusions ran rampant Tools were not important one would have anticipated Source availability was important The academic sites performed the best better than government and commercial sites Managing the press was critical General points for the future have met the enemy and Alleged author the virus was insider Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December Diversity good The cure shouldn worse than the disease may more expensive prevent such attacks than clean after them Defenses must the host level not the network level The network performed its function perfectly and should not faulted the flaws were several application programs Logging information important Denial service attacks are easy central security fix repository may good idea Knee jerk reactions should avoided Appendix describes the virus program subroutine subroutine flow information among the subroutines pictured page Appendix presents the words built the worm dictionary Appendix lists the cast characters defeating the virus Tour the Worm Donn Seeley Tour the Worm specific details were presented walk thru this particular worm program The paper opened with abstract introduction detailed chronology events upon the discovery the worm overview the internals the worm personal opinions and conclusion The chronology section presented partial list representing the current known dates and times PST the descriptive overview the worm defined line bootstrap program written the language plus large relocatable object file that was available VAX and various Sun versions Seeley classified activities the worm into two categories attack and defense Attack consisted locating hosts and accounts penetrate then exploiting security holes remote systems pass across copy the worm and run The defense tactics fell into three categories preventing the detection intrusion inhibiting the analysis the program and authenticating other worms When analyzing this particular program Seeley stated that just important establish what the program DOES NOT what does Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December This worm did not delete system files This worm did not modify existing files This worm did not install trojan horses This worm did not record transmit decrypted passwords This worm did not try capture superuser privileges This worm did not propagate over UUCP DECNET BITNET This worm specifically draws upon TCP and This worm did not infect System systems unless they had been modified use Berkeley network programs like sendmail fingerd and rexec section the internals the worm were examined and charted The main thread control the worm was analyzed then examination the worm data structure was presented Population growth the worm security holes the worms use rsh and rexec network services the use the TCP finger service gain entry system and the sendmail attack are discussed Password cracking and faster password encryption algorithms are discussed the opinions section certain questions that mythical ordinary system administrator might ask were discussed Did the worm cause damage Was the worm malicious Will publication worm details further harm security The Internet Worm Program Analysis Gene Spafford The Internet Worm Program Analysis described the infection the Internet worm program that exploited flaws utility programs UNIX based systems His report gives detailed description the components the worm program data and functions focuses his study two completely independent reverse compilations the worm and version disassembled VAX assembly language Reynolds Page RFC The Helminthiasis the Internet December Section Spafford provided high level example how the worm program functioned The worm consisted two parts main program and bootstrap vector program description from the point view host that was infected was presented Section describes the data structures and organization the routines the program The worm had few global data structures The worm constructed linked list host records The worm constructed simple array gateway addresses through the use the system netstat command array records was filled with information about each network interface active the current host linked list records was built hold user information The program maintained array object that held the files that composed the worm mini dictionary words was present the worm use password guessing Every text string used the program except for the words the mini dictionary was masked XOR with the bit pattern The worm used the following routines setup and utility
