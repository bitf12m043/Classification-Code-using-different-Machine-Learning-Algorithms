Last modified Thu Sep GMT General Gofer and LAL Information General Gofer and LAL Information Welcome Welcome Semantics Programming Languages the for the class and also maintain the computers you using for this course email address jones byu edu and promise answer email questions rapidly can Email the best way get ahold but you want meet with person usually TMCB This general information page was written Kelly Hall who was the last fro this class and updated for use this semester Gofer background For this course using the lazy functional programming language Gofer much what the course materials talks about language called Haskell Gofer nice subset Haskell and chances are you won notice any difference between the book and what got here you hate Unix machines Gofer available for almost any kind computer around Send mail for details You can easily run this PCs Macs Amigas STs whatever will probably even run the Vax The rest this page will cover running Gofer the LAL machines you run Gofer elsewhere check this out first LAL Machine Background LAL Machines you reading this email you probably already logged some machine the LAL group There are several LAL workstations and you can log into any them and all your files will there The machine names are leopard panther cheetah puma jaguar lynx bobcat There also lal but that just different name for leopard Use whichever machine you want all you doing email gofer and editing For bigger tasks stay off leopard and jaguar One the server and the other Windley machine There are facist disk quotas the LAL machines All ask that you keep your usage reasonable levels Follow this vague request and they plenty resources for everyone Getting Ready for Gofer Once you log make sure you enter the correct terminal type The standard login script will assume but you will want type xterm you using standard LAL login window you calling from home use you telneting from elsewhere good choice well you forget set the terminal type when you log you can later isssuing the command export TERM xterm the Unix prompt course you don want xterm you can specify whatever you want Now that the terminal type set make sure you set your default editor have emacs and the Vuepad editors available the LAL machines Pick whichever one you want use with Gofer and issue the appropriate command below Emacs export EDITOR usr local bin emacs export EDITOR usr bin Vuepad export EDITOR usr vue bin vuepad Clever users will stick these commands into the file profile and forget about this Note this profile and not login for any you archaic shell users Starting and Interacting with Gofer Now you can start Gofer reliably type the word gofer and Gofer will start print out some information and prompt you with character this point you can enter expressions for Gofer evaulate you can issue commands the Gofer program For list commands enter Whenever you get tired Gofer you can leave issuing the command quit the prompt The commands you probably use most often are edit and load Start editor from within Gofer typing edit filename where you can replace filename with the name text file try foo This should start the editor you specified earlier Add couple the example expressions from the Gofer Haskell tutorial and save the file Exit your editor and Gofer should resume Load the file you just edited issuing the command load filename Hopefully there were errors and Gofer will print out the results evaluating the stuff your file any case you can back and edit that file again issuing another edit filename command This process repeats until you get tired Gofer exit with the quit command You could just type those expressions straight into Gofer evaluate but then you have type them over and over again whenever you started Gofer Using editor and text file lets you save your work Wrap That all have for now Feel free send email you can ask questions everyone the class using our class mailing list modified Mike Jones Date
