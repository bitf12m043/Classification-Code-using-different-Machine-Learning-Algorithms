OverviewProposed Catalog Description Software Project Management Techniques for planning organizing scheduling and controlling complex software system development and support projects Instructor William Junk Computer Science Dept University Idaho Moscow Telephone Fax alternate Mail billjunk uidaho edu Prerequisites Undergraduates Software Engineering Individual Design Project permissionGraduates Software Engineering Analysis permission May taken non computer science majors who have basic understanding how software should developed Resources Students must have the ability communicate with the instuctor via mail and must have facilities access the World Wide Web Goals Upon completion this course participants should Understand how software development fits into more complex product development activity able select appropriate software development life cycle for project Know the development processes required typical software development project and able select development processes appropriate for specific development project able plan software development project including identifying key processes and their interdependencies identifying documentation needs preparing detailed project schedule estimating project resources and costs able recommend effective project organizational strategy for specific development project able effectively monitor software development project able perform software project risk assessment Understand the relationships between software development activities organizations and other activities organizations within the enterprise Understand social and environmental factors that contribute hinder software development activities Textbooks Mike Cotterell and Bob Hughes Software Project Management International Thomson Computer Press Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister Peopleware Dorset House Fred Brook The Mythical Manmonth Anniversary Edition Addison Wesley Grading Participation Readings Exercises Individual Project Final Exam Undergraduate and graduate sections the course are graded separately Due slightly different schedules off campus and campus sections are graded separately The difference between the undergraduate and graduate versions the expected level accomplishment Because additional academic study and work experience graduate students should able provide greater insight and depth discussion all phase their course work Just example expectations for the amount effort put into the individual project substantially higher for graduate students pages for undergraduates versus pages for graduates Participation All students are expected make regular contribution the class campus students should prepared offer their comments regarding material presented ask interesting questions during class and respond with good answers questions asked class Calling attention high quality article topic discussed class pointing out interesting WWW site relating personal experience etc are encouraged Off campus students should also these things and communicate with regular basis using mail fax telephone mail particularly interested hearing your perspective practitioners meaningful contribution each week considered satisfactory level portion some class sessions will devoted discussion and feedback based questions and comments supplied from off campus Term Project The course also requires approved term project that should practical application some concept studied the coruse The project expected more extensive for graduate students than for undergraduates For example you might base your project around preparation Software Project Management Plan that follows IEEE standards review published literature software risk assessment and prepare report study software process metrics from your organizztion You are expected propose topic and receive approval before starting Additional guidelines will provided Assignment exercises Several exercises will assigned during the semester Most these will individual assignments however one group assignment anticipated Topical OutlineProject planning general concepts What project planning and management The Project Management Plan IEEE Std Product development life cycles Complex systems hardware and software Conception retirement Time market issues Software development life cycles Waterfall Incremental evolutionary Spiral Software maintenance Life cycles incorporating software reuse How pick the appropriate life cycle Software development processes Process concepts Process maturity CMM Key process areas CMM Process interaction
