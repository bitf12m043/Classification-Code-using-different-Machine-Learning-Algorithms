Thematic RolesHomework optional due Wednesday Mar Project InformationWhat Turn for the ProposalProject proposals are due Monday March but happy look them before then The project proposal should contain short description the topic problem which you interested the papers that you read you doing reading project description the general approach you plan use solve the problem you doing programming project plan for evaluation the theory technique for both types project What Turn for the Project Official due date Friday accept projects without penalty until Friday Programming projects Final Writeup for Programming Projects just few pages Problem description Description general approach Description and results evaluation Discussion what worked what didn work options you like have tried analysis the results etc also like see any code that you wrote and few short traces the system action that makes sense for your project Class Presentation minutes length Should include overview the problem your solution evaluation method and results Non Programming projects Final Writeup for Non programming Projects This will vary for each person but general the final writeup for non programming projects will probably contain description the problem that you looked summary the papers that you read critique the existing approaches your attempt evaluation the the theory algorithms presented the papers real text Class Presentation For non programming projects the class presentation should synopsis what you include the paper You have leave lot out course Programming Projects from Last Year ClassGrammar Induction using Genetic Algorithms This project implements grammar generator using genetic algorithms AutoSlog and FALCON Automated Lexicon Construction This paper evaluates the performance AutoSlog and FALCON lexicon constructors Preposition Attacher This project uses matching algorithm for preposition attachment Statistical Word Sense Disambiguation This project implements number related statistical methods for word sense disambiguation and evaluates the method using examples from the Brown corpus Automated English Esperanto Translation This project implements limited English Esperanto translator extending James Allen bottom parser Implementation Method for Word Sense Disambiguation This project implements relaxation network approach like CIRCUS for word sense disambiguation based Large Neural Networks for the Resolution Lexical Ambiguity Veronis and Ide The Viterbi Algorithm and Smoothing This project implementation part speech tagger using Hidden Markov Model smoothed bigram language model and the Viterbi algorithm Reading Projects from Last Year ClassTopics Intelligent Multimedia Multimodal Interface This paper examines two existing systems that incorporate intelligent multimedia multinodal interfaces WIP and COMET Using FOIL for Phrase Disambiguation This paper examines ways use FOIL for phrase disambiguation FOIL supervised learning algorithm for acquiring concepts first order logic Natural Language Understanding the Japanese Language This paper summarizes issues for understanding Japanese Approaches Automated Question Answering This paper addresses issues understanding and replying questions given English Word Boundary Detection Continuous Speech Recognition Application Phonological Constraints This paper looks three models that use broad class phonemic sequence and allophonic constraints facilitate word boundary detection Computer Understanding Conventional Metaphoric Language This paper looks MIDAS Metaphor Interpretation Denotation and Acquisition System for understanding conventional metaphor Analysis Transformation Based Part Speech Tagging This paper critiques the article transformation based part speech tagging Neural Networks and NLU This paper looks neural network applications for natural language understanding Pronominal Anaphora Resolution This paper describes four approaches the computational task resolving the pronoun referents Harmonic Grammars and Unaccusativity This paper looks Harmonic Grammars developed Smolensky Legendre and Miyata Return home page MIME Version Server

requires least RAM run the compiler comfortably more memory will help performance when compiling large programs are currently supporting only single configuration the Concert system order make Concert work your system you must have the following Sparcstation with memory GNU compiler version GNU gmake make program used build Concert executables you cannot compile programs without Any version gmake should work fine GNU Emacs version Emacs required run the Concert Debugger and the Emacs interface the Concert Compiler and Emulator See the Concert System release notice for more information All these programs are freely available from numerous anonymous FTP sites you not have one more them use archie find the FTP site nearest you you don know how use archie clicking here will connect you the main GNU software server prep mit edu The Concert System publicly available from the Concurrent System Architecture Group the University Illinois will come tar file and can installed simply untarring The software not the public domain offered freely for use education and research obtain the current release Concert Software click the button below The release over even compressed form may take while download the newest version Concert supporting our new langauge ICC The compiler Concert has been tuned for ICC and the compiler more robust for Concurrent Aggregates Concert software distribution
