protocol abstract data type Protocol layers can stacked top each other variety ways run time This paper starts out with describing the many classes protocols that can supported this way Next describe the Horus object model that designed for this technology and the interface between the layers that makes all work then present example layer which implements group membership protocol Then look example stack protocols which provides fault tolerant totally ordered communication between group processes conclude with presenting some remaining challenges our project How view this documentDisplay

read carefully make sure you everything that required Some the things will include are Test Data and Correct Output The gradesheet may contain list test data that will used check that your program works correctly Make sure your program follows the assignment specifications and produces the required output Always run your program with the given test data and manually check your results for errors You must run your program with the test data given but also make sure works for other valid data For some the advanced programming assignments you may asked create your own test data User Interface Provide meaningful prompts for the user when reading values from the keyboard Display the results appropriately labelled that they are easy understand Correct use FORTRAN statements Use the most appropriate FORTRAN statement solve the problem Make sure these statements work for all possible valid input values not use any FORTRAN statements which will not cover class prior the due date hasn been covered class then you shouldn use your program yet Indenting neatness and variable names All FORTRAN code should written uppercase letters Comments and documentation should written mixed case Leave blank lines between the major sections your program Indent statements and loops three spaces Always try use meaningful variable names six fewer characters Functions subroutines and arguments Use functions and subroutines break down the problem into simpler sub programs for clarity and efficiency Always use arguments pass values into and out functions and subroutines not use global referencing COMMON blocks unless specifically asked Flexible modular robust and efficient Design your program that can easily modified and enhanced Solve the problem the most obvious and straight forward manner Avoid writing redundant statements not include unnecessary statements but not sacrifice clarity for efficiency Documentation You must include comments your program Explain what your program does how use and how works Describe all variable declarations Explain what the major sections your program are and how they work Explain all functions and subroutines and their input and output arguments Explain any sections code that are complex tricky Copyright copy Gareth Bestor bestor wisc edu Last modified March
