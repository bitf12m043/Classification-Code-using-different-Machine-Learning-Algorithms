whatever you have finished assignment the due date for partial credit you must miss exam for good reason your responsibility contact before the exam Leave message the above number send email You are the assignments without collaboration You can ask questions about any aspect assignment General discussion with others the system approach problem constructive and okay However since your grade based your assignments they must your own work Students who hand programs written assignments which are identical nearly identical are cheating This type scholastic dishonesty usually results immediate

Concave Minimization Mangasarian November Two fundamental problems machine learning misclassification minimization and feature selection are formulated the minimization concave function polyhedral set Other formulations these problems utilize linear programs with equilibrium constraints which are generally intractable contrast for the proposed concave minimization formulation successive linearization algorithm without stepsize terminates after maximum average linear programs problems with many points dimensional space The algorithm terminates stationary point global solution the problem Preliminary numerical results indicate that the proposed approach quite effective and more efficient than other approaches How view this documentDisplay the whole document one the following
