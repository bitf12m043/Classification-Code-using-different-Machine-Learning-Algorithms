Updated October CSRVL projects and Windows For number CSRVL research projects supervised Ramin Zabih will moving WindowsNT are hopeful that this move will supported Microsoft About Windows NTWhat Windows Windows Microsoft highly portable next generation bit Windows operating system Even with its radically different architecture Windows provides backward compatibility with DOS Windows and POSIX applications even non Intel processors Windows designed extensible possible Borrowing from the design CMU Mach Windows consists priviledged executive and set non priviledged servers called protected subsystems design unique that protected subsystems execute user mode like applications This structure allows protected subsystems modified added without affecting the integrity the executive addition protected subsystems provides modular executive that can easily extended represents system resources objects that can only modified through object specific APIs New system objects can added without undermining existing objects supports drivers that can changed while the system running and can support new file systems devices networks transport protocols simply writing new driver RPC built into that application can call remote services without regard their location the network New services can added any machine the network and made available immediately Windows designed portable possible written primarily with small portions written The only parts that are written assembler are those that must directly talk the hardware and are carefully isolated from the rest the system This means there are variety CPUs that can run including Intel MIPS PowerPC and Alpha chips can run systems with one more processors Windows provides several machanisms increase reliability responds predictably error conditions even those caused hardware failures Structured exception handling used catch software errors Whenever abnormal event occurs exception handling code which exists throughout the system automatically invoked response the condition ensuring undetected error wreaks havoc user programs the system itself addition implements new file system called NTFS which can recover from all kinds disk errors including those critical disk sectors uses redundancy and transaction based scheme for storing data ensure recoverability security measures are class government certified Finally Windows designed fast Each component was written with eye towards performance with each protected subsystem optimized maximize the speed frequently used system calls increase speed communication between protected subsystems Local Procedure Call facilities are provided integral part the Finally networking built into Windows achieve the best possible performance summary Windows thoroughly modern full featured highly compatible operating system for and beyond Mostly Taken from Section Helen Custer Inside Windows Microsoft PressWhy Windows The gap between the performance the typical and the SPARC machines has grown smaller and smaller the same time operating systems for the have grown more and more advanced There are number reasons for moving from current UNIX based environment They include having the results CSRVL work being immediately usable the large and growing Win user base outside Cornell Also basic hardware run has higher performance price ratio than many the SPARC machines available Another advantage using the same from our low end Pentium PCs all the way SMP RISC machines Moving NTNotes moving There are number issues involved moving some the research the CSRVL Windows There are both software and hardware hurdles need leap before researchers can productive work under Note don want make anyone use who more familiar with UNIX has reasons for doing work UNIX This will just another option for doing work the CSRVL Interoperability with the existing UNIX investment important Hardware Right now the CSRVL populated mostly with SPARC IPC IPX systems with few SparcStation machines and clones Soon have dual processor Micron Mhz Pentium system well None the SPARC systems will run and far aware won run the near future will therefore need number workstations which will probably clones and also interested multi processor system which may Intel RISC Microsoft maintains list the SMP hardware will run Software Microsoft going provide software completely outfit ten machines initially get determine what complete means this end put together list software interest the CSRVL You can find descriptions most these products the Microsoft web site Visual recently released manufacturing Windows Workstation Windows Resource Kit Visual Basic Pro Fortran PowerStation Office Pro Productivity Suite Subscription MSDN Level Two for each researcher UNIX Interoperability tools emulator NFS software Projects Move The following are brief descriptions projects that are ongoing the CSRVL and could benefit from Windows Spatial Energy Histograms many applications color histograms are used compare images Their advantages are their efficiency and their insensitivity small changes camera viewpoint Their chief drawback their lack spatial information which can lead images with very different appearances have similar histograms describe histogram based method for comparing images that incorporates spatial information MPEG Browser and Scene Break Detector Until now could view mpegs just like could watch movies Unfortunately were unable take the advantage digital format have not seen mpeg players allowing user skip arbitrary frame fast forward rewind etc Even more importantly the video was basically sequence frames with structure But obvious that video higher structure than frames can partition video into shots scenes and larger chunks like movies shows etc can also partition the video accoding the content for example might want select segment video which particular actor appears Mpeg browse provides interface for browsing video User can play video stop arbitrary point fast forward What the advantage MPEG Browse over other video players MPEG Browse adds very limited yet useful structure the video partitions the video into shots Based these information the browser can skip the next shot much like player can skip the next song The scene break algorithm was developed Ramin Zabih Justin Miller and Kevin Mai For more details about the algorithm see the web page ATM CameraMatt Welsh designing realtime video source for the Cornell NYNET ATM Cluster which will allow machines the cluster capture and process images high speeds The video source employs framegrabber and ATM interface card both over PCI implementing kernel drivers for both cards well some form Active Messages and Net for this machine The video source should compatible with the Cornell IBM well voskuhl cornell edu Date Tue Jan GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Using Knowledge AutomaticallyUsing Knowledge Automatically The Bledsoe Philosophy automated theorem proving basically the belief that automated provers must use human like methods order successful mathematics When mathematician tries prove theorem has the knowledge thousands theorems and definitions also knows how and when use them This very difficult process automate Automatic and semi automatic theorem proving programs which are able use the knowledge other theorems and definitions are thereby able reach arbitrarily far into formalizable mathematics and prove certain types theorems The IPR program provides method for storing and accessing mathematical knowledge that automated theorem proving program can use effectively hope this step the right direction The report atp Benjamin Shults reports some work this field See the report atp for more clear description the framework without the examples Since the publication those papers other challenges have appeared you are particularly interested this work then ask about work progress you have feedback want more information Contact
