ABSTRACT this paper describe the rules the SET VAR prover which extension Resolution and which handles theorems subset second order logic also give example proofs using the system and show that the rules are sound And conjecture that the prover complete for certain extension first order logic which includes many the theorems real analysis This System based earlier set variable prover implemented natural deduction atp atp tex Precondition Prover for AnalogyW Bledsoe Computer Science Department The University Texas Austin Austin Texas describe here prover that normally acts ordinary theorem prover but which returns precondition when unable prove the given formula the formula attempted proved and returns the precondition then theorem that can prove This prover uses Proof Plan its simplest mode when there proof plan acts like ordinary Abduction show here how this method can used derive certain proofs analogy this uses proof plan from given guiding proof help construct the proof similar theorem debugging automatically that proof plan show here the analogy proofs few simple example theorems and one hard pair and The given proof plan for used the system prove automatically and that same proof plan then used prove during which the proof plan debugged automatically These two examples are similar two other more difficult theorems from the Theory Resolution namely GCR the ground completeness Resolution and GCLR the ground completeness Lock Resolution GCR and and GCLR have also been handled essence this system but not completed all their details atp ascii ATP May SET VAR Implementation Bledsoe Computer Science Department University Texas Austin Texas This paper describes implementation the SET VAR proof procedure program itself found the file SET VAR LISP written LISP and attempts prove theorems FOL certain extension First order logic see below call SET VAR THM causes attempt automatically prove the theorem THM Even though believe that SET VAR complete for FOL know that this implementation not because have made several restrictions see below order speed the search But believe that still retains most the generality SET VAR itself atp ascii Using SET VAR Prove the

Knowledge Base Mathematical Theorems and Definitions Benjamin Shults Department Mathematics University Texas Austin Austin bshults math utexas edu IPR automatic theorem proving system intended particularly for use higher level mathematics discovers the proofs theorems mathematics applying known theorems and definitions Theorems and definitions are stored the knowledge base the form sequents rather than formulas rewrite rules Because there more easily accessible information sequent than there the formula represents simple algorithm can used search the knowledge base for the most useful theorem definition used the theorem proving process This paper describes how the sequents the knowledge base are formed from theorems stated the user and how the knowledge base used the theorem

Department Mathematics University Texas Austin Austin bshults math utexas edu This paper covers the framework underlying the IPR prover some whose success illustrated ATP The presentation here more clear than the presentation ATP but this does not include the examples theorems proved Abstract mathematician knows thousands theorems and definitions and able choose just the needed results and use them just the right time the theorem proving process The problem codifying some bit this process the topic this paper IPR automatic theorem proving system intended particularly for use mathematics discovers the proofs theorems mathematics applying known theorems and definitions from knowledge base Theorems and definitions are stored the knowledge base the form sequents rather than formulas rewrite rules The sequents into which theorem reduced before being put into the knowledge base consistently mirror the ways human might use the theorem Because the data are this form natural fetching
