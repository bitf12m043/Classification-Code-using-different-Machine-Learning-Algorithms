circuit Design Boute Stavridou Melham editors Proceedings the Interational Conference Theorem Provers Circuit Design IFIP Transactions North Holland Nuprl interactive theorem proving system the LCF tradition has higher order logic and very expressive type theory the type theory includes dependent function types types dependent product types Sigma types and set types Nuprl also has well developed Windows user interface and allows for the use clear and concise notations close ones used print Proofs are objects which can viewed and serve readable explanations theorems Tactics provide high level extendible toolkit for proof development while the soundness the system relies only fixed set rules give overview the Nuprl system focusing particular the advantages that the type theory brings formal methods for circuit design also discuss ongoing projects verifying floating point circuits verifying the correctness hardware synthesis systems and synthesizing circuits exploiting the constructivity

OnHeterogeneous Process MigrationDesigning and developing mechanism for process migration heterogenous distributed computing systems with emphasis dealing with heterogeneity the cardinality registers This approach simultaneously addresses the both the problems process state translation and migration point translation and can accomplished using existing tools systems PVM and HeNCEDeveloping demos and providing support for HeNCE and PVM users UAB CIS Load distribution and balancing for parallel search engine Proposed Developing mechanism distribute monitor and balance load from parallel search
