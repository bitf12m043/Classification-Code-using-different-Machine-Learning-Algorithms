Information recommended that participants arriving plane fly into Newark Airport Flying into Kennedy Guardia can add more than hour the travel time DIMACS DIMACS has successfully and quite pleasantly used the Comfort Inn and the Holiday Inn both South Plainfield New Jersey they are next each other The Comfort Inn gives participants DIMACS workshops the special rate two guests share room and the Holiday Inn gives DIMACS the special rate per room includes continental breakfast The Comfort Inn phone number The Holiday Inn phone number The Comfort Inn provides free van service and from Newark Airport You need give them hour notice travel between Newark Airport and the Holiday Inn recommend ICS Van Service for inside the United States The rate per person must booked advance From the New York airports participants may take the Grayline Air bus Shuttle Newark Airport and then ICS Van service from there The first day the workshop October will held the Holiday Inn All workshop events October will take place DIMACS located the CoRE Building Rutgers University Busch Campus Piscataway New Jersey Both the Comfort Inn and the Holiday Inn provide free van service and from DIMACS Participants arriving DIMACS car need parking permit Parking permits will available the hotels and the registration table Please sure park Lot For further questions regarding local transportation and accomodations obtain detailed driving directions the hotels and DIMACS contact Pat Toci toci dimacs rutgers edu Full time Students The participation graduate students the workshop strongly encouraged DIMACS provides funds partially reimburse the cost travel and accommodation for students you are full time student and wish considered for travel support please mark the registration form appropriately The support level per person will depend the number student participants MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last Modified Monday Sep GMT
