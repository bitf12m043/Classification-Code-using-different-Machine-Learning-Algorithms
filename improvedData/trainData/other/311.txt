provides registered students with computer account the UNIX computers You may use any the UNIX computers named sols vegas They are found the computer science building the labs listed below The labs are open from seven days week vega vega vega vega vega vega sol sol printer room with one UNIX consultant you have never had computer science account you can activate your new account running the newuser program any the lab computers Enter the login prompt the word newuser and hit return for the password Then follow the instructions You may also want use home other computer for not want discourage this since more convenient and reduces the demand for the lab computers There are two ways use home other computer You can use telnet connect the lab computers from remote location This provides you with the convenience working from your home office other location without the expense buying your own compiler The second option use home other computer develop your programs different compiler such Borland you choose use this option please see the requirements below Using Telnet for Remote AccessYou can remotely login your computer science account the lab machines this manner you are using the other computer terminal connect the lab computers The connection made using the telnet program UNIX machine you would enter telnet vega wisc edu connect the lab computer named vega Mac computer you need get the Wisc World software from DoIT able remotely access the lab computers This software provides program named telnet and you will need edit the site list add the addresses the computer science lab machines The lab computers are the following addresses vega wisc edu vega wisc edu sol wisc edu sol wisc edu Using Another CompilerI suggest that you use recently updated compiler new and changing language and older compilers may not work with the concepts code samples discuss lecture compile the sample code provided using version the Gnu compiler the same compiler you would use with your computer science account you are using non UNIX computer you will need get some exposure the UNIX operating system One the objectives for that students learn the UNIX environment and its programming tools editors compilers debuggers that they are prepared for later computer science classes you are developing your programs another computer than those provided the labs you must follow these requirements You must compile and run your program your computer science UNIX account before handing each program This will provide you with some exposure the UNIX environment also necessary since the graders use the source code which you hand electronically test your program for correct execution Note that there have been times when student program works fine home but won work UNIX Most often these problems are simple and due things such variables not being correctly initialized You should plan ahead and give yourself enough time verify that your program works UNIX Problems with home other equipment software are your responsibility and are not accepted excuse When you use other computers you are responsible for keeping backups your work and resolving any problems with the system There are too many variations home and other computers and software for assistance will only guarantee that software provide will work with your computer science accounts but experience has shown there are few any problems you are using recent compiler You must still the following Get copies the data files needed Hand copy your program electronically Watch the line information for updates Read
