Conditional execution and logical expressions THEN ELSE END statement Text Chp Notes Conditional ExecutionSo far all statements are unconditionally executed starting with the first and proceeding sequentially the last What don want every statement executed every time run the program Want conditionally execute some statements depending condition which may change every time the program run THEN END StatementUse the THEN END statement conditionally execute one more statements Note END two words unconditional statements condition THEN conditional statements END When the condition true the conditional statements are executed when false they are skipped THEN ELSE END StatementOptional ELSE specifies another set statements executed when the condition false condition THEN true conditional statements ELSE false conditional statements END NUM THEN PRINT Positive ELSE PRINT Negative END Indent conditional statements three spaces column ELSE and END are separate lines Logical StatementIf only have one conditional statement and ELSE part then can put everything single line DAY PRINT Monday Note there THEN END Nested StatementsCan nest statements within the conditional sections other statements YEAR THEN STATUS Undergraduate Fee ELSE STATUS Graduate YEAR THEN FEE ELSE FEE END END The second statement itself conditionally executed depending the condition the first statement Indent each level another spaces spaces Use indentation line statements that they are easy read and understand General StatementUse the general statement when testing multiple conditions each with their own set statements execute YEAR THEN PRINT Freshman ELSE YEAR THEN PRINT Sophomore ELSE YEAR THEN PRINT Junior ELSE YEAR THEN PRINT Senior END The conditions are checked sequentially until one found that true The rest are skipped even subsequent conditions are also true optional ELSE clause executed when none the conditions listed are true LIGHT THEN PRINT Stop ELSE LIGHT THEN PRINT Prepare stop ELSE PRINT Proceed END Use the general statement instead multiple nested statements Logical ExpressionsThe condition tested statements logical expression surrounded parentheses logical expression THEN ELSE logical expression THEN END Logical expressions are similar arithmetic expressions except the result has only two possible values TRUE and FALSE Note the dots before and after LOGICAL VariablesA variable can store TRUE and FALSE using the LOGICAL variable type LOGICAL RENEW assign LOGICAL value LOGICAL variable use the assignment statement just like any other variable logical variable logical expression RENEW FALSE Relational OperatorsRelational operators compare two numbers together produce TRUE and FALSE These can used create complex logical expressions less than less than equal greater than greater than equal equal not equal DAY RENEW DAY TRUE Relational operator names also start and end with dot Operands may literals variables expressions any type except LOGICALs INTEGERs REALs CHARACTER strings RENEW EXP Both operands must comparable types both numbers both CHARACTER strings You can compare apples oranges Logical OperatorsLogical operators compare two LOGICAL values produce TRUE FALSE AND are both operands TRUE either operand TRUE NOT inverts TRUE and FALSE Logical operator names also start and end with dot The logical operators are defined using truth table see for the definitions EQV and NEQV AND TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE NOT TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE Example what the definition bicycle WHEEL AND NOT POWRD THEN PRINT Bicycle ELSE PRINT Not bicycle END Operator PrecedenceVERY IMPORTANT You must remember the precedence order the logical and relational operators This varies between different programming languages First arithmetic operators Second relational operators all have the same precedence Third NOT Fourth AND Fifth Last EQV and NEQV Note the order AND and very easy get wrong with disasterous results Use parentheses over ride the default precedence necessary Example and are both greater than min then Right MIN AND MIN THEN Wrong AND MIN THEN When doubt use parentheses Comparing CHARACTER StringsCHARACTER strings can also compared using the relational operators STATUS Graduate THEN the strings are the same length then they are compared character character Both strings must have exactly the same characters one string shorter automatically padded with blanks before comparing Normally only use and when comparing CHARACTER strings using other relational operators can lead unpredictable results Right ANSWER ANSWER Yes THEN Wrong ANSWER ANSWER Yes THEN Comparisons are case sensitive upper and lowercase characters are very different CHARACTER ANSWER ANSWER Yes ANSWER Yes THEN TRUE ANSWER YES THEN FALSE Copyright copy Gareth Bestor bestor wisc edu Last modified April
