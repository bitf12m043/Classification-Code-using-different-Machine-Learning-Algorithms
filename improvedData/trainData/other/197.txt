performance graphics multimedia and virtual reality applications Canvas extension package the Tcl scripting language Graphics rendering for the Microsoft Windows environment implemented over the Microsoft Direct Immediate mode Canvas designed develop fast graphics applications for low end desktop computers provides user interface for easy interactive development graphical environments such Games Virtual Reality Video Conferencing Virtual Seminar Rooms etc Canvas can embedded into Systems like GUI well scripted provide near real time animation This toolkit intended work any without any hardware accelerator available for graphics support Canvas has been developed research project the Multimedia Research Group Project Zeno Cornell University Department Computer Science Introduction Tcl and DirectXTcl programming system developed John Ousterhout the University California Berkeley and now the Sun Microsystems Lab which easy use and which has very useful graphical interface facilities Tcl tool command language the basic embeddable scripting language while toolkit graphical user interface toolkit based Tcl for constructing Motif like widgets Tcl has been implemented over almost all the existing platforms Also provides core library develop extension features the toolkit Microsoft DirectX Software Development Kit provides set APIs that provides the developers with the resources needed design high performance real time applications such the next generation computer games and multimedia applications Direct API that provides advanced graphics software solutions for typical desktop computers Direct provides high level Retained mode interface that allows applications easily implement complete graphical system and low level Immediate mode interface that applications can use take control over the rendering pipeline well the accelerator hardware ManualCanvas CommandsThe interpreter and script commands implement graphics LibraryThe Graphics Engine

neometron comStanford University November Gates Hall Classroom SITN Channel Jobs commercial software development are team jobs The teams build systems that bring value their customers New hires whether fresh out school transferring from other commercial projects are successful only they can contribute the team goals Yet the formal education these new hires emphasized programming not system building and rarely offered team experience creating and maintaining large systems What might curriculum focused teaching system building contain Faced with that question set out design new system that would support authoring and delivering such curriculum The result LearningWorks available for free the Internet The purpose this talk discuss the user interface design for LearningWorks specifically how the simple metaphor learning books can used both teach software system building concepts and support teams building systems Adele Goldberg currently founder Neometron Inc Texas based company working towards Intranet support for self managed teams Previously she served Chairman the Board and founder ParcPlace Digitalk Inc until April Prior the creation ParcPlace Adele received Information Science from the University Chicago and spent years researcher and laboratory manager Xerox Palo Alto Research Center From Adele served president the ACM Solely and with others Adele wrote the definitive books the Smalltalk system and has authored numerous papers project management and analysis methodology using object oriented technology Goldberg edited The History Personal Workstations published jointly the ACM and Addison Wesley part the ACM Press Book Series the History Computing which she organized and edited Visual Object Oriented Programming with Margaret Burnett and Ted Lewis new book software engineering appeared entitled Succeeding With Objects Decision Frameworks for Project Management with Kenneth Rubin She was recipient the ACM Systems Software Award along with Dan Ignalls and Alan Kay Magazine Lifetime Achievement Award for her significant contributions the personal computer industry Fellow the ACM and was honored with the Reed College Howard
