support for video services support video services packet switching networks are investigating the design and implementation operating system techniques transport protocols and network switches enable various types performance guarantees Motivated variable bit rate video which has very large picture picture rate fluctuations proposed new model for packet video the model have retained the basic notion flow Each flow however sequence bursts each which represents encoded picture have designed efficient algorithm called Burst Scheduling for switching the transmission video flows and other types traffic data and audio packet switch Burst Scheduling networks provide end end delay guarantees for packets and delay jitter guarantees for bursts video flows that satisfy flow specification They have the desirable property that guarantees provided particular video flow are independent the behavior other traffic flows sharing the network and are thus unaffected the presence aggressive misbehaving

and manual pages Although there large amount information available can sometimes hard find This document provides set entry points for navigating the online information All the documents here are also available printed form The Shore Release This document gives brief overview the contents the Shore distribution package specifies the hardware and software requirements for installing and running Shore lists the major packages distributed including another overview the major documents and points information tell you how retrieve the software install start running write your own applications and even extent the Shore server Overview Shore This version paper originally presented the SIGMOD conference the management data describes the goals the Shore project and high level overview its internal structure Shore Software Installation Manual This document describes detail how install Shore Shore distributed three forms documentation release binary release and source release The Installation Manual explains how install the documentation and the binary version Shore and how build new copy Shore from the source release Configuring and Running the Shore Server Once you have installed Shore rebuilt from sources this manual shows how configure for your system and start the server running also explains how use the feature that allows Shore database access like file system legacy applications through the NFS interface Getting Started with Shore This tutorial shows how write Shore application programs describing the persistent data structures like data definition language called the Shore Data Language SDL and manipulating them with programs Shore Data Language Reference Manual This reference manual describes SDL considerably greater detail Scanning Directories Shore Application The DirScan class provides convenient interface for scanning directories This document describes how use the DirScan class The Shore release includes simple example program called shls Shore that illustrates the use the DirScan class Shls can found the examples shls directory the Shore release Scanning Pools Shore Application The PoolScan class provides convenient interface for scanning through the objects pool This document describes how use PoolScans well known bugs and limitations the PoolScan class The Shore release includes three example programs that illustrate pool scans The examples can found the examples pscan directory the Shore release Handling Errors Shore Application This document describes error handling facilities for Shore applications Shore application writers are encouraged read Getting Started with Shore and look the example applications before reading this document The SDL manual and the example programs show the standard ways handling errors Shore This document intended for application writers interested more details Guide the Shore Source Code This document guided tour through the numerous directories the Shore source code briefly describes the purpose each directory and how the code interacts with the rest the system The Shore Storage Manager Programming Interface The Shore Storage Manager SSM package libraries for building object repository servers and their clients The core library the package libsm multi threaded system managing persistent storage and caching typed data and indexes provides disk and buffer management transactions concurrency control and recovery second library libshorecommon provides many common utilities need for implementing both client and servers The third library librpclib slightly modified version for use multi threaded environment the Sun RPC package use the term value added server VAS refer systems built with the SSM VAS relies the SSM for the above capabilities and extends provide more functionality One example VAS the Shore server which extends the SSM provide typed objects with permissions and ownership and organizes storage tree structured name space The overall role the SSM Shore further described Overview Shore This document provides overview the SSM facilities and interface Details the programming interfaces are presented set manual pages Where each facility discussed references are made the appropriate manual pages Writing Value Added Servers with the Shore Storage Manager novel feature Shore that its server designed easily extended support new applications This tutorial shows how extend the server through detailed example the Grid Server Glossary Shore Terms have attempted use technical terms consisten manner through out these documents and the source code The Glossary concise lexicon these terms When doubt please consult this list Shore Project Plans This document describes what the overall plan for Shore has yet done and describes our plans for finishing the Shore project How Submit Problem Report This document describes how submit problem report you find problem with the Shore software documentation Manual Pages Shore comes with large set manual pages the traditional Unix style This page lists them all The manual can also accessed through hot links from the documents listed above from cross references between the man pages and from the introduction pages listed the beginning each section man pages
