two blank floppies one for mail and one for news Bear Access can found the Macs under the Apple menu Once launched Bear Access presents you with menu system from which you may access the WWW browser Netscape the newsreader NewsWatcher and the email application Eudora This handout contains only skeletal instructions for the use the these applications recommend that you read the documentation these applications you are not familiar with them WWW The WWW Internet hypertext resource WWW documents may contain text GUI forms graphics sound animation etc well hypertext links other documents the Web The web World Wide Web refers the structure implied these hypertext links You can jump from document document across machine organizational and geographic boundaries following links you think the documents nodes and the links edges graph you get the idea related material the Web fair amount information related available via the WWW from the home page Lecture notes homework assignments and course information are currently available Videos the lectures may made available the WWW the future Using Netscape Click the World Wide Web the Bear Access top level menu launch Netscape Hypertext links documents may displayed blue underlined text blue outlined icons Clicking hypertext link will cause the document referenced the link retrieved The title the current WWW document displayed the title bar the Netscape window this the document title from the title bar referred below The Location field gives the current URL more this later The Home button may used any time return you the default document the Mac Lab the default document the CUInfo home page The Open button may used jump arbitrary URL recommend that you take look the Netscape handbook select the Help Handbook menu item for further instructions how use Netscape and for further information the WWW Accessing the home page After Netscape has been launched you should see the CUInfo home page The procedure for reaching the home page from the CUInfo home page follows Click From document Other Cornell Web Servers CUInfo Home Page Cornell University Dept Computer Science Other Cornell WWW Servers Course Home Pages

the competition while undergraduate Washburn University developed mathematical methods for composing music used stochastic processes generate musical tunes based composer known style The results were reasonably interesting and paper was awarded First Place the competition now know that stochastic methods for composing music were discovered the the methods thought had invented were not new Nevertheless was interesting bit research ACM holds International Scholastic Programming Contest conjunction with the Computer Science Conference CSC every Spring while graduate student Stanford

Mike Hike Enchanted Rock Enchanted Rock granite dome about miles west Austin You can walk the top and see for miles Once made the top Naren spotted what thought was good restaurant while Jun used the binoculars hunt for his car keys wait getting ahead myself That part came later After exploring the top the rock started working our way down which was quite exciting Later that night managed lock Jun

highlight the tour came when the tour guide asked were Geology Club something Apparently the questions asked had more content than your average cave tourist After the hike the guide stayed behind with and answered more our questions Our usual car problem surfaced this time car started hiccuping halfway the cave and stopped running for while Eventually started again and made without further problems

page maintained and supported Kevin Treu the Department Computer Science Please feel free write treu kevin furman furman edu with questions and suggestions OverviewBy this time you have probably had some experience with basic Web surfing using Netscape and thus can appreciate the amount information that out there and easily accessible What makes the Web truly exciting however the ease with which can contribute this workshop will explore firsthand the basics the HyperText Markup Language HTML used create home pages see how include digitized images and find out how load pages that they are accessible the entire Internet community Introducing the concept HTML The process producing pages for the Web surprisingly simple Once you become familiar with some the basic concepts you find document preparation for the Web easy you presently find word processing Hopefully that good thing Home page authoring employs the Hypertext Markup Language HTML address the meaning the hypertext part shortly The markup part the key the simplicity HTML What reveals the fact that documents are created merely adding special characters called tags basic text files That marking them begin start Netscape and find any page interest The page you first will Select Source from the View menu You will suddenly find yourself looking screen full characters some which probably look familiar you others which probably not What you are looking the HTML file which processed the Netscape program create the page you were looking when you executed the Source command Our goal for this page make perfect sense you the end the workshop Let start explore this language the first part our workshop create sample personal page your diskette Alternatively you can work the hard disk your computer but for obvious reasons you shouldn this public lab Create subdirectory your diskette called Web Use the Windows utility NotePad begin editing your home page Save the Web directory under the name index htm for reasons that will explained later Save your diskette not the hard drive the lab The contents should simple text including your name the first line your class year and major the second your campus address phone number and mail address subsequent lines list your classes for this term paragraph describing your extracurricular activities and interests Note Any word processor would suitable for this purpose long you can save files text only ASCII format The key that you not have all the special control characters which regulate margins indenting fonts styles etc word processor but have meaning the Web When you are through editing the file save and start Netscape Note that you can keep both Netscape and NotePad running one time Just use the alt tab key sequence toggle between running applications Now see what the fledgling home page looks like the File menu and select Open File The resulting dialog box permits you open any file your disk HTML document Navigate your diskette and open index htm Kind mess right Notice that Netscape ignores all tabs carriage returns sequences spaces etc simply takes the characters you have produced and runs them all together what done next Marking the text with tags course Before proceed should discuss the fact that HTML indeed limited language the present time Don expect able all kinds fancy formatting like you can with word processor That just not what HTML for least its current incarnation Version HTML due out soon will have some pretty nice new features though However you probably already know from your Web explorations some fairly eye catching presentations can created Let start see how Beginning HTML tags Almost all HTML tags have the following format tag text possibly including other tags tag see there are some notable exceptions but general you should always think tags coming pairs The first set tags consider are general structure tags These are used identify certain parts your document Though not strictly required all browsers they reflect good HTML style and start with them briefly The structure tags include html used bracket your entire document head identifies the prologue your file typically including the title body identifies the main content your document Change the context from Netscape NotePad edit your file Edit that looks like this html head head body what you written far body html Next add title Every Web page needs brief descriptive title This what becomes accessible various Web searchers identifies pages stored Bookmarks lists and the menu and displayed the top the Netscape window when accessed This uses you guessed the title tag title title your page title placed between the head tags Edit your file include appropriate title such Jane Doe Personal Page Don forget save the file Switch back Netscape view the page again When you are Netscape click the Reload button This will cause the changes you have made take effect You won notice much different this time except that now the title included the top the Netscape window Now let start making the page bit more presentable start with would certainly like separate logically related passages text from one another probably identifying them with appropriate subtitles Just like outline paper The heading tags take care this nicely Surround both your name and class year with tag pairs for example Jane Doe Junior English Major Proceed placing subtitles your document for each section using headers Address Information address stuff you wrote before Class Schedule class stuff you wrote before Activities and Interests activity stuff you wrote before Save your file and use Netscape once again check out your document Use the Reload button That little better Note that the heading tags are numbered according size with the level one tags the largest and the level six tags the smallest Effective outline style presentations can easily constructing using these Try experimenting with some different sizes Turning our attention the specific contents each section our document would least like separate lines text from those intended different lines Two tags both notable examples tags which not come pairs are used for this They are the paragraph and line break tags Whereever they are placed document they cause the character immediately following begin new line the case the paragraph tag there blank line inserted before the next character displayed The line break tag simply causes the new text the very next line Insert line break tags after each line your address phone number information and after each your classes After the last item each section insert paragraph tag For example Room Number Box Number Phone mail address Once again check out the file with Netscape Things are shaping Note not this with your class activity information get those shortly Adding links other documents far only seen HTML not very good word processor What makes special though the ability include hypertext links the Web pages produces These are the highlighted words and images page that can take you somewhere else the same computer halfway around the world with single click Fortunately these links are very simply implemented HTML They employ tags just like have already seen The general format link href resource URL text image that easy Now basic familiarity with Universal Resource Locators URLs has been assumed for this workshop brief however URL such this one http furman edu treu cheers html breaks down follows http identifies the resource accessed hypertext page furman edu identifies the machine address the Internet treu cheers html identifies the path the resource There can numerous variations URLs The resource identifier may other things besides http for instance You should notice some other options your net travels Sometimes the path may omitted well the file name This because certain paths and file names are accepted defaults Netscape and other Web browsers soon see what those defaults are for our system important this point note that URLs come two forms absolute and relative The easier the two understand the absolute form short absolute URL one that fully specified including http another resource identifier and the machine name The previous example absolute URL Specification URLs can sometimes simplified using the relative form This possible whenever link another resource the same computer included short the resource identifier and machine address can omitted this case long Netscape can figure out where resource based where you currently are what you need specify terms URL minimal For example currently accessing page own directory treu and want access the Cheers page the relative URL simply reduces cheers html simplify matters just remember this use relative URLs when you are creating links pages your own and use absolute URLs when you are creating links pages elsewhere the Web Let add link two your home page Many people include list interesting Web sites their personal pages Let start such list your sample page Near the end the file before the body tag insert the following Links check out href http cool infi net Cool Site the Day Use Netscape open the file You should see the words Cool Site the Day highlighted blue You have created your first link Clicking this text should take you interesting Web site which you have visited before Try out Find and write down the URLs other interesting pages and add new links your list You can also make link out any text your page See you can find Web page dedicated one your activities interests and make key word your activity paragraph into link that page Presumably you will create more pages your own All you need create file that ends htm your Web directory and create link For instance say you create page containing information about your favorite band Just store this page band htm the same directory your index htm file create the link all you need something like this href band htm Favorite Band Compare this use relative URL the absolute form you have used thus far Much simpler right That because band htm stored the same place index htm Try this Create new page ending htm using NotePad and save your Web directory The contents the page are unimportant Create link this new page your index htm file and try out soon see that images and not just text can made into links well The mail link popular Web page feature have link which allows someone quickly and easily send mail the author particular page Add one these your page Surround your mail address with tag using the mailto indicator your name were Jane Doe you would add href mailto doe jane furman furman edu doe jane furman furman edu bit more HTML Before moving the inclusion images your document lets apply bit more polish using additional features HTML Horizontal rules You have already separated the different segments your page using subtitles Often non text separator also desirable for just this purpose that HTML includes facility for including horizontal rules dividers These are implemented using another non pair tag which stands for horizontal rule Prior each level two heading include the tag Check the effect using Netscape Lists probably clear from your Web travels and from this workshop far that information often best organized into succinct lists HTML provides tags for the implementation three majors types lists unnumbered numbered ordered and descriptive implement the first two today and leave the third your reading and experimentation Make your list classes into unnumbered list The basic tag for such lists additional tag for each list item required also and you might expect this tag Make changes follows class class class Next make your list interesting links numbered list using the tags Check out the page using Netscape Note this point that there problem applying new tags for the list around the tags you already used indicate links general any number tags can applied the same text long makes sense Character formatting Some rudimentary character formatting abilities are provided HTML but won spend much time them Try experimenting with and tags for italic and bold text respectively Another popular feature the ability center text Center your level two headers enclosing them the tags center center Venturing onto the Internet Thus far your page really hasn been accessible anyone but you and that probably just the way you want right now because stored your diskette which not accessible from the Internet since isn running Web server change this you will have upload copy your page computer which does have Web server running the next activity you will learn how this For the moment however keep things simple and keep them your diskette Using images Finally let add image your page Images that are interspersed with your text are called line images More other types images later special kind tag called img used include these This tag uses the following basic format img src URL for image Let add picture the beginning your page just before your name The first thing you will need course digitized image some kind Fortunately these are easy come Any image that you find displayed the Web can downloaded your diskette and used see how done let get copy the Furman masthead from the Furman University Home Page First use Netscape access the Furman home page http www furman edu The masthead image the top the page get copy simply click using the right mouse button and hold the button down menu will pop the screen Select Save This Image You will then presented with dialog box like those you have seen before Navigate your Web directory and save the image simple that Now add the image your own page using the img tag described above Edit index htm include the line img src furman gif right after the body tag Once again open your page using Open File Netscape check out the new image Note Other options for the img tag include align and alt The former defines how image positioned relative surrounding text they are interspersed The latter defines textual substitution for the image the event your page being read text only browser such Lynx the interests time omit these options today Consult HTML text ask you like know more though Other sources images There are numerous sources generic images that you can use make your pages more visually appealing These include buttons icons fancy lines backgrounds etc Remember that anything that you can view using Netscape anywhere the world can downloaded and use your own pages Take advantage this addition you can create your own original digitized images using drawing painting tool Finally you can digitize existing images with the use scanner accompanying workshop describes how make use this technology mentioned earlier hypertext links need not always text can make the Furman masthead image into link the Furman home page simply including the URL for the image inside the tag for link Modify the img line you just added read href http www furman edu img src furman gif Test the image link using Netscape Repeat the image copying exercise copying interesting separator line image from the Web Two good sources for these are http www widomaker com spalmer lines solid index html and http www widomaker com spalmer lines textured index html Pick one and copy your directory use replace the tags horizontal rules your file with the appropriate HTML line This good test whether not what you done far makes sense general line images should used with careful thought Cluttering your pages with too many images can not only unattractive but source considerable inefficiency for those trying access your page Backgrounds Suitable images can used backgrounds your pages make them more eye catching Repositories these images can found all over the Web Access the location http www netscape com assist net sites backgrounds html Select one the background patterns and copy your diskette you done twice before For file called background gif change the body tag index htm read body background background gif Use Netscape see the effect this simple change Advanced topics Though have hopefully laid strong foundation for understanding HTML and writing multimedia hypertext Web pages today there lot HTML and the Web that are omitting including the use images sounds and movies external resources writing fill out forms and clickable imagemaps incorporating other Internet tools such mail FTP Gopher and News along with various and sundry small features HTML Maybe will have follow lab cover some these topics but the meantime you have access various HTML textbooks and the best teacher all the Web itself Just can access images from other pages can access HTML ideas too Use the Source option the View menu regularly you see something interesting and you would like know how accomplish you know how get look the HTML code itself you see appealing page layout somewhere save copy the HTML source use template filling your own information where appropriate There substitute for experience and experimentation when comes learning HTML try build some more experience our afternoon session today but hope that you continue explore after this workshop concludes HTML Editors You will not always have your Web authoring using the gory details HTML described this lab Already there exist several HTML editors which like word processors allow you create Web pages using the what you see what you get concept your interest creating Web pages grows you may want check some these out Ask about finding good editor you like More information With this workshop and maybe suitable textbook you have great deal information about HTML and the Web digest lot more can found the Web itself Just point you couple productive directions suggest you look the following NCSA Beginner Guide HTML http www ncsa uiuc edu demoweb html primer html Bob Allison Webmaster Page http gagme wwa com boba
