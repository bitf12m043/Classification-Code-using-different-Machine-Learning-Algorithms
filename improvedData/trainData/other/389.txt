throughout the clearing clear that dan reads more than would make pat robertson happy then again who cares recently read books and topics queer theory just finished Vice Versa Marjorie Garber which was very interesting book about bisexuality and how ignored yet actually ubiquitous wish could get over our fixation with freud though almost done with The Celluloid Closet Vito Russo basically his theme that impossible find people who are incidentally gay lesbian let alone bisexual movies from the beginning the medium not that that has changed much the time since then this book was made into movie well sort russo died aids and the movie quite different from the book very interesting consider just how absurd the gay characters movies over the last years have been great example might the sal mineo character Rebel without Cause the cowardly lion also hideous just how duplicitous hollywood has been changing themes major literary works and lying about the history well known gay people beethoven was bisexual immortal beloved not Jonathan Ned Katz The Invention Heterosexuality magnificent assault the notion that heterosexuality normal eternal universal actually the term only years old and actually the attitudes surrounding which basically the notion that sexuality and pleasure can separated from reproduction also roughly from that time period again though too much freud Gilbert Herdt Youth Horizons nice book about gay kids chicago starts with really nice representation the classic social constructivist view gay people which really appreciated little overly anthropological found this frustrating but not too much since less polemic than otherwise might also wrote large number books the early about ritualized homosexuality areas around new guinea such the sambians who believe that the only way they can become masculine ingest semen not making that joining the tribe nice book about gay kids all over the country there quite difference the statistical academic presentation anthropologist like herdt the last book than the presentation journalist like the woman who wrote this one she entirely interested anecdotes while almost not all gay not good beautifully offensive tract from the pre aids days interesting course the fact that this pap still gets written published despite threats from the militant homosexual wing which its author suggests runs all publishing that were the case why mass media fucking biased anyhow get such marvels analysis the advantages homosexuality such our extra free time increased leisure cash and lack need members the PTA and don have take care our loved ones because all unloving sex crazed monsters good thing this book DID come out before aids gorgeous discussion greek society along the lines the greeks were the best that homosexuals could and they didn know about things like the germ theory disease circulation the blood sub atomic particle physics they weren much now were they coupled with really nasty description socrates the most important gay man all time who was still woman hating pederast etc and salacious reference what find the lives lesser homosexuals like tchaikowsky vinci wilde hey you know hear chairman mao was straight lenin too gods damned heterosexuals medical description which seems written old about why heterosexual sex better than gay sex this guy needs better sex life but let not there reread pat califia public sex the culture radical sex recently she basically writing about whole bunch marginalized even queers sexual behaviours sex with minors how many you waited til you were why anti porn feminists are silly comment from john katz this that the image women happy housewives commercials probably does far more harm women than does pornography and other topics her porn also highly rated yours truly also enjoying reading some essays gore vidal about sex the poster child for the there such thing homosexuals just homosexual sex movement have some disagreements with him but writes well computer science reading alon spencer the probabilistic method which basically tries prove that combinatorial objects exist creating probablistic space which includes all objects certain type and showing that object with the desired properties will randomly selected with non zero probability thus objects the desired type exist cute but lacking much motivation that nice but why care that graphs with this property exist after all and can find them ketan mulmuley computational geometry through randomized algorithms lovely book about this kind computer science really really enjoying when get reading preparata and shamos computational geometry the more classic book the topic drier more out date and precedes the whole discussion how randomization can make something like geometry which ultimately largely about sorting and searching much faster also reading random books like conference proceedings volume about life some soda proceedings and other books fiction lately been reading mostly gay themed fiction not that avoiding heterosexual fiction but can seem accidentally get straight fiction off the week shelf olin library the grad library here cornell not that really mind but did seek out some the following however and some straight themed anyhow manuel puig kiss the spider woman was really neat read friend nohemy who moving stanford month and saw the play the kitchen theater downtown ithaca which seems not the web and read the book translation after that one difference between the book and the play not seen the movie that the play valentin and molina only have sex once which way thinking minimizes the significance their emotional attachment the book they over several day period may sound small but significant anyhow very interesting read gore vidal the city and the pillar was really upsetting the first book ever deal with gay people all nicely and even kind upsetting recommend really melodramatic intense quick read however slightly less appaling andrew holleran dancer from the dance though still ends with the faggot dying why that tragic yet beautiful chronicle the life gay man moves from one who has not joined the tribe its most stereotypical member ack why know these people still even though the book mid daniel vilmure toby lie made cry that alone pretty impressive all toby wants dance with his boyfriend the prom and nothing seems willing let him vilmure also wrote life the land the living which about white trash kids the south nice nice voice scott heim wrote mysterious skin from whole bunch different voices which tell about one boy obsession with ufo and how realizes that was abused kid while telling really pretty intergenerational love story the same time also just emailed thank for mentioning him this page that kinda neat its own right you know was also odd now that think about realizing just how much seems different reading books about kids that were written say the early century versus today because more like the current ones because seek ones who are more like because the writing more honest who knows lars eighner pawn queen four pat robertson worst nightmare funny story about the drag queens who really run the planet enjoying book lesbian vampire stories called daughters darkness quite lot right now read cute book about love and murder british department store recently called everything and more that worth read also reading portnoy complaint philip roth and some shitty norman mailer crap why people read this shit other topics also been reading some biography anthropology computer science papers and the occasional truly bad trash novel read too much here what generally like read about consciousness and what modern science can tell about how the mind works good books this topic are very hard come but the recent collection called android epistemology recently published the mit press good start wary anything that was written someone who actually has scientific background there was bitchy editorial the new york times just today about how well respected scientist managed confuse some sociologists science with complete crap about quantum mechanics and its impacts literary theory but this stuff all too common check out higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science jhu press for more details this topic ick philosophy theoretical computer science this extends discussions artificial intelligence which also the previous category but also involves whether concepts like turing machine the kleene heirarchy have any real philosophical importance almost all that read this topic bunk too witchcraft been practicing witchcraft for few years but most books this topic are also crap couple exceptions are the books starhawk margot adler drawing down the moon and the books the farrars email you like more information about this topic gay and lesbian politics again topic which has too many bad writings don agree with most what they say but you could check out the writings bruce bawer the writings jeffrey weeks unfortunately however this topic seems lack competent middle ground perhaps keep believing that there should one when there needn who knows gay and lesbian history there are good books this brian boswell books same sex unions premodern europe and christianity social tolerance and homosexuality are fantastic books about the medieval history gay people more modern sense the auto biographical books paul monette especially becoming man are fantastic you could always read david halperin you wanted obscure religions last semester read about scientology and this summer seem starting off journey discovery mormonism ack what scary people contemporary fiction cornell library includes week loan group books which are often very interesting and current and the undergrad library has month loan period everything including new books very nice medieval history anti technological rantings folks like kirkpatrick sale who really should stop publishing phototype they want authentically make their message anthropology modern primitive societies erotica really nice site the one that run circlet press which was partially founded friend mine you might also check out the site run good vibrations computer science what study operations research what currently study math what really study are the music
