childhood there until family moved the the early eighties One greatest interest during childhood computers Indeed soon after arriving the States father bought Commodore birthday present Computers and hit off pretty well and ended spending most teenage years adapting new homeland and messing with various computers Indeed sometimes like think that learned how speak English and how program Basic the same time Until college years family and lived New York City Despite being brought city kid hated New York dirty unfriendly expensive and crime ridden when had the chance somewhere else took and ended upstate New York Cornell University Now love Ithaca very much during the non winter seasons The environment beautiful the air clean the people are helpful and polite and the night skies are filled with stars The winters here however drives nuts always snow sleet rain ice salt dirt etc ARRRGGGGHHHHH had wanted major Computer Science when started Bachelor degree but changed mind during freshman year Instead decided take broader view the various disciplines taking the most flexible the engineering curriculums operations research and industrial engineering ORIE The flexible ORIE curriculum Cornell enabled take large number courses things interested ranging from computer graphics economics from history small business consulting the same time also had experiences starting own company working for large company and serving consultant local business Soon after finished job with Exxon and returned Cornell fell love with this young woman lasting regret didn work out and was heart broken was perhaps because was emotionally shattered that was just greedy that took the highest paying job could find ended working Wall Street after completing bachelor degree must admit that made dreadful mistake working Wall Street Even though the money good the environment bad filled with politics rude people and infighting Eventaully realized that money not everything and decided focus doing something enjoy and environment that like came back Cornell First round off knowledge computer science then chill out Ithaca and see where life takes next Check out PhotosDark Walker Sunset
