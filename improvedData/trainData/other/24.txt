September Due Date October For assignment you get take your first crack actually programming game will provide you with code which call the Arcade Package which handles most the low level messy stuff such selecting the video mode setting back buffer and page flipping You have design fairly simple arcade game draw the graphics and program the inner workings your game You have three weeks create working arcade game design and software engineer carefully make sure you are done expect game the order Centipede Grading Criteria Your grade assignment will based factors the game fully fuctional The most important thing that looking for working game the game almost but not quite finished still contains bugs your grade will suffer When you design your game make sure you can finish the project within the three week time frame Create schedule and stick the game nontrivial You won get good grade your final game just pong with different colors and bigger paddle Your game doesn have original clone classic arcade game fine but should something you are proud hand the game well designed talked about designing game and some the design sins that are commonly made Make sure you show that you were paying attention class and learned something your code well structured and commented will looking your code and the easier read and follow the better mood will when comes time decide grade Tools this assignment you will need use compiler such Borland which available CAEN machines the Arcade Package which available the class webpage and paint program such the Windows Paint program also available CAEN machines Compiler The Borland compiler available CAEN machines and should work well for this project Make sure when you create project you set the Platform DOS Standard and the Target Model Large necessary may have evening session introduce people the compiler and the Arcade Package The Arcade Package This code has been written specifically for this assignment handles all the low level stuff that such pain game programming the class website you will find simple Pong program which was written with the Arcade Package All you have replace the pong code with your game Notes the Arcade Package The Arcade Package written and Wednesday half the lecture will introduction the Arcade Package Please try look the code over and perhaps compile the Pong program this will excellent change ask questions Your game will limited pixels and colors The arcade package somewhat object oriented You will creating game objects paddles and balls Pong and for each object writing number functions which update the position the object Update handle collisions with other objects You Hit and draw the object Draw addition you will get input from the mouse the keyboard Paint Program You will have create graphics for each your game objects You can use any paint program which creates PCX files The Paint program windows appropriate the shareware program Paint Shop Pro What you hand Three weeks from today which October you will hand the following items floppy disk with your game executable Printouts all your code manual for your game write containing explanation your code what the data structures are and how the program organized and anything special that you would like point out the grader will then begin the grueling task playing all your games Additional Notes you have questions about the Arcade Package please bring them class email them both vanlent umich edu and mikeott umich edu bugs are found the Arcade Package will announce them class and the class webpage you are having problem please check the webpage before emailing for help Half class Wednesday will devoted explaining the Arcade Package Please don miss this class you are absolutely unable make might able set appointment cover the material Date Tue Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Simulation Library version Simulation Library version Dan Reznik Susan Hert Madison Robotics LabWhat The simulation library collection language functions that provide framework which develop computer simulations robotic systems helps programmer concentrate solely implementation issues specific his her simulation such particular motion planning algorithm new type kinematic structure The idea simplify and standardize the low level aspects most simulation programs graphics user interface construction run time interactivity and factor out the repetitive steps specific writing simulations robotics For example many simulations involve constructing and drawing robot its environment addresses that providing high level language interface which define draw and animate robot its environment and the interaction between these two The library supports User interface construction and run time interaction Drawing and manipulation geometric primitives Color and animation modeling transformations Obstacle database management Sensor based motion planning algorithms Modeling and manipulation robots Downloading and installing The library can obtained via anonymous ftp from robios wisc edu directory pub Both IRIX and SunOS versions are available compressed postsciprt version the user manual for the library also avaliable via anonymous ftp from robios wisc edu the directory pub TechReports case you need help Please contact one the following people Dan Reznik dreznik berkeley edu Susan
