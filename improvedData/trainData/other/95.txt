retrieve Program follow the Program link from the Home Page the Program page you will see the Program Folder link Click this link Netscape will retrieve the folder the desktop should appear new folder named Program Note other new files appear ProgramN sea ProgramN sea hqx you may throw them away They are used get the folder from the Web and are not needed once you have the folder Move the Program folder onto your floppy disk Note Netscape might pop dialog box asking you where put the folder this happens select your floppy disk the dialog box and click the button expand the folder into your

Instruction Fetching Trace Cache Low Latency Approach High Bandwidth Instruction Fetching Eric Rotenberg Steve Bennett and Jim Smith April Superscalar processors require sufficient instruction fetch bandwidth feed their highly parallel execution cores Fetch bandwidth determined number factors namely instruction cache hit rate branch prediction accuracy and taken branches the instruction stream Taken branches introduce the problem noncontiguous instruction fetching the dynamic instruction sequence exists the cache but the instructions are not contiguous cache locations This report considers the problem fetching noncontiguous blocks instructions single cycle propose the trace cache special instruction cache that captures dynamic instruction sequences Each line the trace cache stores dynamic code sequence which may contain one more taken branches Dynamic sequences are built the program executes predicted dynamic sequence exists the trace cache can fed directly the decoders investigate other methods for fetching noncontiguous instruction sequences single cycle The Branch Address Cache and Collapsing Buffer achieve high bandwidth feeding multiple noncontiguous fetch addresses interleaved cache and performing complex alignment the instructions they come out the cache Inevitably this approach lengthens the critical path through the instruction fetch unit Extra stages the fetch pipeline increase branch mispredict recovery time decreasing overall performance Our approach moves complexity due noncontiguous instruction fetching off the critical path and onto the fill side the trace cache compare the performance the trace cache against other fetch designs first consider simple instruction fetching mechanisms that predict only one branch time fetch only the first taken branch also consider more aggressive methods that are able fetch beyond multiple taken branches For integer benchmarks the trace cache improves performance average over the fetch unit limited one basic block per cycle and over the fetch unit limited multiple contiguous basic blocks The corresponding improvements for floating point benchmarks are and Further the trace cache consistently performs better than the other high bandwidth fetch mechanisms studied even single cycle fetch latency assumed across all mechanisms Simulations with more realistic latencies for the other high bandwidth approaches based pipeline stages before and after the instruction cache show that the trace cache clearly outperforms other approaches average and better than the next highest performer for integer and floating point benchmarks respectively How view this documentDisplay the whole document one the following formats PostScript bytes compressed disk will sent uncompressed
