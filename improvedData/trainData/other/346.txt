Every often visit him work and see the huge computer rooms Sometimes bring home pieces computers for see But had idea what these things really did They were just cool looking Sometime when was father brought home some IBM documentation programming languages and flowcharting tried read them but they did not make any sense but this not surprising since IBM isn exactly famous for clearly written documentation came MIT During the first few weeks went tour the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory which those days included the Logo Lab don remember why went the tour but remember that was with several other freshmen with whom lived fraternity but can recall were all together the Lab because were together new members the frat whether came join that frat because liking the people met the Lab The former seems more likely especially since the house had strong representation the Lab any event were playing with Logo and were left pretty much alone had figure out ourselves had lot fun with undergraduate would sometimes come the Lab play hack with Logo and began learn program don remember anyone teaching think must have taught each other Sometimes would try use Lisp the PDP but was too mysterious for figure out That summer worked for IBM operator low level position calling for about much skill espresso maker But spare time work was allowed use the computer language APL and this time found textbook for the language was able learn some still had idea how languages actually worked just used them sophomore year took the course which the ancestor the course now known This course explained how computer language could designed using simpler language building blocks also tried give some sense the ideas modularity and top down design and most crucially the idea abstraction that one can make program which represents some concept set agreements and thereafter use without needing know how the concept was implemented The program becomes black box whose internal details are irrelevant Later that year took second course which explained how the simplest sorts computer languages machine language could implemented hardware circuits was now able understand computer programming down the level individual logic gates wanted This reinforced sense the value keeping different levels separate order build large complex structure Later though would learn that one the hardest problems deciding where draw the modularity lines and that putting one borders the wrong place makes system slow and difficult use The next major step learning programming was student job the Architecture Machine Group which ancestor the Media Laboratory those days group students the ArcMac were developing new operating system for use around the lab The operating system being new was full bugs and these turn demanded that there constructed many software tools for examining the structures used the program had the opportunity look over the shoulders those who were more experienced and even use the tools bit poke around was while using one these tools that suddenly understood that there actual meaning the patterns binary ones and zeros machine and significant difference between the information disk and the machine memory given region memory can instruction number letter picture The difference solely matter interpretation This was perhaps the biggest aha life and was happy that other people were around who could understand and why mattered was while working this same job that began think not just about how make program something but how make easy for someone else use This was also step towards being professional programmer worker who makes artifacts for others use not just for his her own delight making was also during this time that also began good enough designer that other people started taking ideas for design and function seriously After graduated began work the real world programmer first job was Imlac Needham The Imlac was minicomputer what you call workstation now that was sort expanded PDP with built vector display processor was programmed assembly language Imlac big product was phototypsetting system CES which took advantage the raster graphics offer kind WYSIWYG interface for the typesetting This was before laser printers kept this first job only year and then moved new job with the Honeywell Multics Multics operating system great historical importance was first developed partnership MIT and General Electric experiment practical very large time sharing system the time was the very cutting edge the state the art computer science the time joined the Multics group those days were past but the group retained some measure pride and still had very high standards even though time had passed them learned several important ideas from working with the Multics people First understanding interface the relation between program and user expanded include the idea that the user might another programmer was important make programs building blocks programmers whose needs you could not expect easily anticipate second idea was that programs were meant read people well machines The Multics group had developed programming process which required that all modification the system described and justified group senior programmers before being written and read some person other than the author before being installed This was necessary because Multics was far too large for any single person understand The coordination that this review board provided kept Multics stable and consistent grew and changed for more than years Though Multics now nearly forgotten set mark for software quality never equalled Working with Multics taught careful designs always allow room for unanticipated future changes and expect people read programs work Multics came know many people but one particular note was Bernie Greenberg Bernie was one the most brilliant programmers have ever met addition was very talented musician playing both rock guitar and baroque harpsichord with equal ease and spoke several languages Bernie also introduced Lisp that time the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was developing the first Lisp Machines and Bernie was friends with several the key workers this project learned Lisp from Bernie not long before left Multics join new startup company commercialize the Lisp Machine soon left well join Logo Computer Systems new firm which intended implement version Logo for the Apple home computer Logo Computer Systems was the first time was ever with startup firm Instead the formal regulations Multics was with adhoc group which included several close friends and lovers well some bizarre personalities LCSI worked very very hard because knew that money was short supply would often work for hours row did almost all our work Lisp Lisp Machines and gradually became expert with this language the end managed produce our product time but then most left the company result political battles with the higher management This turned out blessing though because Alan Kay had just gone Atari which was then quite rich and Alan was setting research labs California and Cambridge Almost the entire Boston staff LCSI came form the Atari Cambridge Research Center Atari gave money design the best work environment could think and freedom work problems that interested Not only was able work music was able hire one friends Tom Trobaugh work with Atari knew the happiness working with partner problems really cared about using the most powerful computers available Alas Atari began lose money and one day closed the lab After Atari went under enrolled the MIT Media Lab one the first contingent doctoral students The Media Lab The Media Lab encourages students set their own directions fact insists This has both pros and cons The advantage that you learn independent think outside the common assumptions the field The drawback that you don always have the companionship others while learning own case became interested the linguistic phenomenon called paraverbals those inarticulate noises like huh and hmmm that help make conversation run smoothly There pretty large literature the subject but had discover own and sure would have gone faster with guide the other hand with experienced authority controlling learning wouldn have done what did The other important thing about the Media Lab the constant focus demonstrating one work Some people complain about but very important good demo you have able explain what you doing and why matters smart but uninformed person with just few short sentences You have learn clear and you have learn express your idea for the benefit the learner not the teacher And you have learn grace under pressure wish everyone learned these skills One the first projects worked was the phonetic dictionary Remember when you were kid and you asked grown for the meaning word and they told you look the dictionary That fine idea except hard when you only heard the word and don know how spelled This especially true for English with its bizarre spelling rules The phonetic dictionary allows you look word spelling according how sounds not how spelled You write some approximation the sound the word and the system consults dictionary that organized pronunciation The key the thing was being able accept wide range phonetic spellings For example for the word headache you might write hedayk hedake was pleased see this project mentioned the very first page Stewart Brand book about the Lab supervisor was Chris Schmandt known all his login name geek could write length about his knowledge but there are lots smart people the world has two qualities that are more rare First autocrat You can argue with him There way put air superiority when you call yourself geek Second and even more valuable kept his perspective particular was always taking off for week two time bring his then baby daughter out into the wilderness learned from him that computer will happily sit idle for week while week lost from fathering gone for ever major project was the Back Seat Driver which was car that could give you driving instructions the city Boston had street map knew the roads navigation system knew where was and speech synthesizer could talk you actually make this work needed car and not just any car The navigation system was supplied our sponsor Japanese electronics firm and was designed work with only one type car top the line luxury sedan also needed not one but two cellular phones the car for the communications The Media Lab bought what needed and kept the keys was surely the only graduate student the USA with such lab equipment One day was demonstrating the Back Seat Driver group from General Motors When took them out for ride they had great time shooting pictures each another getting into Japanese car Off went driving usually happened one point the driver missed turn Normally the consequence was that the BSD would calmly inform the driver the fact and plan new route only this case the driver was former race car driver and quickly made illegal Turn without even slowing down maneouver even seasoned Boston drivers never attempted This caused the program crash but guess that better than crashing the car have add something here about the demise Lisp Machines and the rise Unix and about becoming obsolete MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday
