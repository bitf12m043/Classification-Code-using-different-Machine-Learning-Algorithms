WEB Ramin ZabihCornell University Consumers often purchase mass produced items that are available from many different vendors These different vendors usually charge different prices were easy compare prices consumers would benefit substantially and every consumer would able get the best price This would create what economists call efficient market Until recently was too expensive make pricing information widely available With the World Wide Web the cost publishing information has fallen dramatically Because the Web may now possible create efficient market for many mass produced consumer items example consider the market computer peripherals such printers modems etc December the cheapest nationally advertised price could find for the Hewlett Packard printer was while the most expensive price was But took many hours reading advertisements obtain this information There are several hundred vendors who sell mail order peripherals and isn easy compare prices Several efficient markets exist including the stock exchange and the commodities market Items these markets such Hewlett Packard stock are available for single price any given time and that price widely known Consumers rarely benefit from these markets because they not trade consumer goods The PriceWeb Experiment Together with some friends Cornell have begun experiment called PriceWeb http www priceweb com PriceWeb attempt create efficient market computer peripherals For given peripheral PriceWeb web site provides list nationally advertised mail order prices listed increasing order This makes simple find the lowest priced vendor PriceWeb becomes widely used will have major impact the way that computer peripherals are purchased Mail order vendors would have charge single uniform low price unless they can offer customers some additional value Computer peripherals are sold with fairly standardized warranties and return policies vendors compete primarily price and availability This makes product differentiation difficult efficient market most vendors would have lower their prices Short term PriceWeb works the advantage consumers and the disadvantage most vendors But the long term there are advantages for vendors well Consumers will able buy items without worrying that they are over paying this argument similar Saturn haggling policy for new car buyers And course prices should fall These effects should lead more customers line service like PriceWeb could have additional advantages for vendors For instance sometimes vendors wish clear out inventory selling item very cheaply See Onsale for example line pricing information can eliminate the delays involved print media advertising thus allowing vendors more rapidly adjust their prices Also the Internet users who monitor pricing information will presumably quite price sensitive listing item low price should generate large response These advantages vendors have balanced against PriceWeb negative effects vendor margins the negative effects are larger there will consolidation among vendors How much would consumers save efficient market One might expect mail order prices peripherals nearly identical but they aren The average price spread items that PriceWeb covers and some items have large price spreads For example the OfficeJet advertised for little and much the vendors wished avoid efficient market they would have several options For instance each vendor could sell slightly different items every printer were significantly different from every other printer would impossible compare their prices But this would increase manufacturing costs and confuse potential customers thus reducing market share This effect illustrated the American automobile industry which for years offered enormous range options partly prevent consumers from comparing prices The Japanese offered very few option packages which gave them price advantage manufacturing the computer industry almost everything mass manufactured due extensive standardization see TNO for discussion the economic impacts standardization this option not viable because opposition from the manufacturers efficient market could also thwarted punishing the lowest price vendor For instance suppose that all the higher priced vendors refuse carry Hewlett Packard printers unless the lowest priced vendor forced raise its prices could turn raise the price that charges that vendor cut that vendor off completely But this probably would not interests More importantly such actions would violate number laws against price fixing such the Robinson Patman Act excellent overview available from the Federal Trade Commission These laws make illegal for manufacturer fix the price that vendors charge line efficient market would also easier for the Government monitor Price fixing efficient markets more obvious than markets where there are multiple prices For example suppose vendor cut its prices below costs drive rivals out business and then raised its prices This pattern would fairly easy spot efficient market with pricing information available line The recent SEC investigation NASDAQ trading practices was motivated academic study pricing trends this market this data were not available electronically anti competitive behavior would harder detect Challenges There are number challenges that will need overcome order create efficient market One potential difficulty concerns updating price information PriceWeb information comes from printed national advertisements market where prices change rapidly advertised prices may out date before they appear print The obvious solution would use line prices from vendor Web sites but there are some obstacles While few vendors such Computability provide line pricing information most not fact surprisingly few vendors have Web sites Also price that appears printed comes with legal protections against false advertising These guarantees may not apply Web based advertising Even most vendors put their pricing information line may hard compare prices For instance consider Andersen Consulting BargainFinder which helps consumers buy audio Compact Discs cheaply BargainFinder queries line vendors that sell via mail order Unfortunately these vendors currently block BargainFinder from accessing their sites Because BargainFinder actively queries line Web sites exists the pleasure the vendors the short term they may not wish cooperate PriceWeb will need become economically self supporting which challenge line pricing information what economists call public good like for example lighthouse notoriously difficult get the beneficiaries public good pay for addition the Internet culture makes hard charge users for information believe that consumers will not use PriceWeb they have pay for There are companies that think consumers will pay for such service CyberSave Shopper for example these companies are correct they will create market pricing information Mark Casson chapter Information Acumen Routledge discusses the effects markets information efficient market requires perfect information the costs associated with information fall the market can become more efficient There are costs associated with obtaining pricing information for computer peripherals PriceWeb does not reduce the costs obtaining the information but instead collects the information centrally and makes freely available PriceWeb might viable simply because the cost running the experiment low Placing information Web page costs almost nothing and the costs associated with gathering and entering data are also small Even small amount revenue from advertising for instance could make PriceWeb self supporting addition there are number services that PriceWeb could provide for vendors that would provide revenue For instance vendors could automatically notified competitor beats their advertised price Will the Web Eliminate Retailers web based efficient market could also affect the relationship between vendors and manufacturers Most manufacturers not sell directly customers but via retailers Retail stores carry products from multiple manufacturers customer can compare products side side Manufacturers attempted protect their retailers various means for example the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price usually quite high that every retailer can charge less than MSRP Manufacturers protect retailers ensure that retailers carry their goods But with the growth mail order the value provided retailers could diminish may become profitable for the manufacturers enter the mail order business themselves efficient market could eliminate many middlemen efficient market consumer goods would have substantial impact society For example could eliminate many retail stores favor mail order vendors who can locate areas with low fixed costs This could have massive consequences for many communities which have downtowns built around retail shopping course consumers shop for other reasons than obtaining the lowest price For some items such Tylenol the savings may small that isn worthwhile find the best price However large supermarkets spend great deal effort trumpeting small price advantages possible that many shoppers are price sensitive and would prefer efficient market the Web creates such market its impact could far greater than any effects have witnessed thus far While many retailers might disappear some new businesses will also come into existence For instance will become much cheaper establish the kind specialty businesses that traditionally only flourish large cities business that only appeals small percentage the population can flourish the Web because can easily reached potential customers Conclusions There have been several experiments Web based consumer empowerment which are similar spirit PriceWeb One example the BBN Auto Mechanics List profiled Rich Lethin TNO This site lists local auto mechanics the Boston Area Besides providing names and addresses also includes customers comments their experiences with each shop The comments are summarized the moderator provide overall grade for the repair shop potential customer can view the comments other customers and can also add their own comments Another example The List which performs similar service for Internet Service Providers Like Consumer Reports these sites focus giving consumers useful subjective information The Web has made efficient market consumer goods possible because has dramatically lowered the cost publishing information Until recently only large corporations few unusual individuals could reach large audience The Web has changed this and are just beginning understand its implications MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content

Features the Solar Photosphere Herschel Snodgrass and Sara Dailey Solar Physics Abstract cross correlate pairs Wilson magnetograms spaced intervals days investigate the meridional motions small magnetic features the photosphere Our study spans the period July August and the correlations determine longitude averages these motions functions latitude and time The time average our results over the entire period expected antisymmetric about the equator poleward between degrees and degrees with maximum rate but for latitudes below degrees markedly equatorward and weakly equatorward for latitudes above degrees running average shows that this complex latitude dependence the long term time average comes from pattern motions that changes dramatically during the course the activity cycle low latitudes the motion equatorward during the active phase the cycle tends increase the zones activity move toward the equator but reverses briefly become poleward solar minimum the poleward sides the activity zones the motion most strongly poleward when the activity greatest high latitudes where the results are more uncertain the motion seems equatorward except around the times polar field reversal The difference from average meridional motions pattern remarkably similar the pattern the magnetic rotation torsional oscillations The correspondence such that the zones which the difference from average motion poleward are the zones where the magnetic rotation slower than average and the zones which equatorward are the zones where the rotation faster Our results suggest the following characterization there constant and generally prevailing motion which perhaps everywhere poleward and varies smoothly with latitude this superimposed cycle dependent pattern similar amplitude which

correspondence between the meridional motions pattern and the torsional oscillations pattern the magnetic rotation suggests that the latter may artifact the combination meridional motion and
