statements You will bypass the default illumination model which built into the Image module doing this you will able control lighting effects directly For example you will able define spotlight make the intensity object drop off with distance Procedure First you need download several example files this click each the filenames shown below When the text window opens use the save option put the file your own directory Name each file with the same name shown below LightTemplate net LightTemplate cfg The program LightTemplate net implements spotlight entirely within using compute modules Ambient diffuse and specular terms are each computed and added together obtain the intensity each point Follow the flow the program see how the intensities are computed For the initial program assumed that the light finite distance from the objects but the viewer very far away direction Some examples the program output are shown below The first shows spotlight oriented along the axis with width width means dot The small white dot icon showing where the light The arrow icon showing the direction the spotlight The next image the same light position but with the spotlight width that the light omnidirectional The bright spots the surfaces near the light are due large dot the diffuse term Notice that the diffuse reflection has the color the surface while the specular reflection has the color the light white You can turn off the default shading collecting single AmbientLight with the object you are rendering AmbientLight ingores normal information All you see the color defined for the object were lighted from all directions uniformly The example program constructs surface calculates the surface normals then throws away the lighting information produce unshaded surface because there AmbientLight module The colors you calculate become the color the objects the image module Note that you must use the Camera Display module show the image because the view vector must available the program not use Image module Throughout this exercise leave the viewing distance infinity that leave the Camera module perspective flag Modify the program use the dot formulation specular lighting rather than dot Make interactor choose which model you are using All surfaces get more shiny high angle incidence Modify the specular term simulate this effect Below example what the modified program might generate The specular reflection the vertical plane releatively diffuse because the angle incidence near zero The specular reflection from the horizontal plane narrow because the angle incidence high the light grazing the surface Clarification You need make some part the specular term dependent the angle incidence arccos dot The light shown omnidirectional light The definition the reflection vector given page Watt The spotlight given you has soft cutoff with angle Modify the program that instead dropping off power cosine the intensity uniform for angles less than certain value and zero for angles more than that value Angle measured here from the vector Include interactor choose between the cutoff methods The two images below show soft cutoff spotlight and hard cutoff spotlight Note the jagginess the edge the hard cutoff light which results from very abrupt cutoff function Try minimize the jagginess your program Modify the program fly the light through scene consisting few objects The light should spotlight which flys curved path with the direction the spotlight tangent the path for about half the flight then the spotlight should suddenly lock onto one object and remain locked for the second half the flight One frame possible animation shown below Bugs The term the calculation the specular term should moved the final calculation that dot calculated The Compute module does not understand transform objects don use Rotate Scale Translate Transform modules when you are building your scene Questions Writeup prepared demo all the functions specified the first three bullets above ambient lighting diffuse lighting light position light directionality and specular reflections two kinds one program All interactors should labeled have appropriate ranges and step sizes and more than two control panels The code should well documented and organized prepared demo the flying light separate program What seem the differences between the dot and dot specular lighting models terms the appearance objects Write the formula you used make surface more shiny high angles Write the formula you used impelment sharp cutoff spotlight Back Main Page Lab Last modified Land
