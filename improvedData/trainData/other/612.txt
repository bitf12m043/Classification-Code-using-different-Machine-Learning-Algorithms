programs for this class become familiar with the Sun environment become familiar with the compiler and reading its messages Overview need use some special files for this class therefore you will create customized command compile and execute your programs This will briefly show you some command tool shell commands Then you will continue using the file manager the command tool and the edit tool You will type the program the second page this lab compile and execute You will submit that program Finally you will copy another program make some changes and report what happens This will give you experience reading the compiler error messages and seeing what caused those messages Creating customized compiling command not completely standardized Not all compilers include string class The Sun compiler does not But string class will the standard and using makes some problems easier Therefore need include our own string class whenever want use strings This easiest way for this create customized command for compiling our programs This command will call the compiler but will also tell the compiler where look for our string class and link when use don expect you understand this part the lab You will not tested You learn these commands time goes the command tool shell type the following boldface commands Note the period the command The plain text right describes what you are doing move home directory mkdir bin create bin sub directory bin move into bin directory grader katz bin copy command your directory rehash tell shell see new command list files and permissions Labs back Labs directory You should back your Labs directory Now whenever you want use strings your code you can use the command compile programs You can also use for compiling all your other programs for this class Creating hello ccCreate Source File Labs folder Make sure you are the Labs folder the file manager and choose File Create Document Drag over its name and call hello Open the file Type the program below hello from the text Include your name the comments Get into the habit indenting the program shown with three four spaces Programs are for people read much for compilers translate Proofread your typing Save the file but leave open Compile and Execute Move the command tool Type see listing the files your Labs folder hello should there Type hello compile This will also execute the program you have errors you have errors carefully read the messages and correct the problem modifying the source program the edit window Save your changes and then run the compiler again Submit your Program the command tool use submit and think about your answers give your class account the hello lab Note that the name use for submitting usually the top the lab handout Code for hello include iostream traditional first program with user defined function author your name today date void Hello cout Hello world endl int main Hello return Modifying Existing ProgramCreate New Program from Existing Program The second program file named grader katz examples bday bday from text the file manager locate the file copy Double click open the editor Use Save change its name bdaygood and put your Labs directory Add your name the comments Save Then use Save again name bday this point you have two copies the file your Labs directory Both contain your name You will editing bday The other file backup Compile and Execute the Program Compile and execute bday with bday Create Observations FileTo ease your writing hand you record your observations file named obs txt Create the editor Put your name the top Practice Reading Error Messages The Changes Exploration section below describes several changes make the program Follow those instructions and record your observations your file Save your answers after each observation sure save your program changes before you try compile and always undo the change before trying the next change When you are done submit your observations file observe Make sure you save before you submit Log out Save any work before logging out Quit any editor sessions Use the menu mouse button over the background and choose Exit Changes Exploration For this portion the lab you will make changes program Each change will break the program slightly You will save the broken program and try compile Report what you see your observations file Between each break restore the program its original state before proceeding When you finish make sure the program its correct state save and turn your observations for grading For each change start with the original program For each change answer the following questions there are multiple messages and lines give the first two errors warnings What the text the error message first two many Include the line number that the same line that you changed use View Select Line Number Did the program execute Does the output look pretty Undo the previous change and make the next change HINT Drag over the text the messages you want copy Press the Copy button the left side the keyboard Click your observations file where you want the text placed Press the Paste button HINT the command tool shell you can repeat command typing exclamation point and one another exclamation repeat the previous command the desired command number enough the beginning the command choose the desired one most recently used Changes MakeChange CPstring cpstring all lowercase Change int void int main Change main Main int main Change person kid Sing string person Change the first Delete semi colon end first cout statement Delete the closing brace bottom program last line file Delete return Delete every them Change Sing Grace Sing Grace delete quotes around string call Delete four calls Sing main program and replace the name the remaining call with your name you may leave this way
