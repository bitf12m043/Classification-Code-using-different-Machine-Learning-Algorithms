image warping implemented and tested high quality color images Input parameters the algorithm are the source and destination images and the source and destination meshes windows widget interface used display pair images for reference input the input and output meshes The mesh interpolated the size the images cubic spline used this case The second step would use this routine align images for mosaic splining Todd Bezenek and Yinong WeiA Spherical Mosaic System image mosaic conglomeration overlapping images which the images fit together well that their combination indistinguishable from single large image the same subject Many efforts have been expended create mosaics with various properties this project intend develop mosaic that allows the user view entire three dimensional space any one direction time which his position fixed the center Jon BodnerHand Gesture Histogram Recognition Analysis and Improvement project based the paper Orientation Histograms for Hand Gesture Recognition Freeman and Roth This paper describes simple algorithm analyze grey scale images hands and recognize the gesture Their definition gesture static refers the gross hand orientation given time The algorithm used the paper rotation dependent but lighting invariant For the first part project intend implement the Freeman and Roth algorithm and try out with several sample images generate The images will taken different lighting mirror the tests performed Freeman and Roth After testing out the correctness implementation intend test the limits the algorithm two areas rotation sensitivity and lighting sensitivity particular want explore the limits lighting insensitivity and depth the limitation rotations Lighting insensitivity one the strongest features this algorithm There exact quantification given the paper only presents two different lighting levels possible would like measure the ambient light with light meter and determine the range which the algorithm performs best Testing the limits rotation little harder Gestures their nature are not rotation invariant However humans use fuzzy range match given hand signal not clear how wide the recognition range for Freeman and Roth algorithm especially with similar gestures Once the range determined would like implement fuzzy function which used the matching between the training sets and the gestures recognized will then compare the results this modified version the results the original Yanming CaoHand Gesture Recognition will implement Freeman method for hand gesture recognition described the paper Orientation Histograms for Hand Gesture Recognition Freeman and Roth from Proc Int Workshop Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition The algorithm claimed the authors simple and fast uses the histogram local orientation feature vector for gesture classification and interpolation relatively robust changes lighting Nirupama Chandrasekaran and Jamie JasonMosaic Construction using Gaussian Pyramids The goal image mosaics take collection images and combine their information such way obtain single image During the early stages this process images must registered determine correlation between them This registration can rather expensive and time consuming process for class transformations that include both translation and rotation this project plan investigate coarse fine image registration using Gaussian pyramids our project the first step image registration build Gaussian pyramids for the two images wish register Currently are proposing that the top the pyramid image that approximately pixels Once have the Gaussian pyramids can begin registering the coarsest level will then use the registration information from higher level coarser hint the next lower level finer This hint will used reduce the search space the neighbors the corresponding pixel the next lower level Beth ColeHough Transform Variations for the Detection Circles and Ellipses project will consist paper Hough transforms The paper will begin with brief introduction what Hough transforms are followed short survey the uses advantages and disadvantages the method The second section will introduce variety variations and improvements the original conception The third section will examine some these variations with respect the particular task identifying circles and ellipses well additional variations that are particular the task identifying circles and ellipses conclusion comparison the suggested methods will made with suggestions for possible further work Joshua ConnerShape Recognition through Machine Learning This project will attempt move further the vision hierarchy combining features into simple concepts will train neural network using simple features such number corners and edge lengths and then determine its ability classify images into shapes Success the system will measured terms generality shape which can identified well robustness over range inputs Jonathan Goldstein and Marc ShapiroFinding Overlapping Simple Shapes using Really Generalized Hough Transform The goal this project develop and implement algorithm decompose image into set overlapping shapes For instance can choose circles and rectangles with constant gray levels primitives Each circle the decomposed image would characterized four parameters center coordinates radius and gray level rectangle would have five parameters lower left corner coordinates width height and gray level The output the algorithm front graph partial ordering the shapes found the image The result compact approximation the image overlapping shapes Gil GribbWhat Ever You Need From What Ever Works Data Driven Approaches Intermediate Level Vision Real world application machine vision techniques has been limited several factors Most heuristic algorithms rely several fudge factors which are difficult tune manually Many physics based approached make simplifying assumptions that significantly reduce performance real world settings Additionally these algorithms often require accurate technical information about the problem such camera parameters surface properties conjecture that these difficulties can bypassed learning the target function directly from examples Previous research this area has primarily focused window based approaches which are inherently scale dependent These techniques while effective for low level vision suffer from the curse dimensionality when applied intermediate level vision task propose family scale independent neural network techniques closely related pyramids the discrete Fourier transform and the wavelet transform hope show that this methodology can applied learn shape from shading from small number examples Rebecca HastiHand Gesture Recognition Using Orientation Histograms quick and efficient method for computer recognition hand gestures would useful number situations For example system which recognized hand gestures real time could used instead mouse operate computer For this project plan implement gesture recognition method for static hand gestures using orientation histograms described Freeman and Roth Orientation Histograms for Hand Gesture Recognition Proc Int Workshop Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition This method pattern recognition using orientation histograms relatively simple and fast and somewhat insensitive scene illumination Kirk Hogenson and Todd TurnidgeApplications the Steerable Pyramid The Design and Use Steerable Filters Adelson discuss the creation orientable filter filter that selects specific direction This orientable steerable filter capable detecting the response the image filtering any desired orientation based the result few basis filters The steerable filter can extended select specific scale well orientation yielding steerable pyramid filter The pyramid roughly analogous the Laplacian Pyramid that each level corresponds information different scale the image with orientation image response any desired scale can determined from the basis scales levels the pyramid With such pyramid one can accomplish numerous tasks often performed machine vision applications such edge and contour detection adaptive noise reduction and stereo matching For our project intend implement such steerable filter well some its applications Mike JamesInternal Signature Keying Improving Robustness Snake Local Edge Finder This project proposes improve the distraction avoidance capabilities snake tracking system without moving the global object level The edge localization abilities the snake are currently achieved local level but only look for the strongest edge along line normal the snake When tracking object boundary the snake will closed contour For solid object the pixel values immediately inside the contour are likely remain constant Viewed along line normal the boundary this can viewed signature look for subsequent search iterations The local edge finder can then set look for this signature well the intensity step signifying the boundary hoped that this will help the edge finder avoid picking potentially stronger background edges that may fall inside the search window Ted PerkinsSolving Single Image Random Dot Stereograms SIRDS for Depth Normal random dot stereograms work presenting each eye with two separate images correspondences between the two images allow the reconstruction depth map based horizontal disparity between corresponding patterns dots SIRDS combine the images for both eyes into single image relying semi periodic random dot fields program will written look SIRDS and reconstruct depth map The first stage the problem will scan for potential matches for each pixel and iterative relaxation scheme will used arrive hopefully globally coherent solution Dan ReplogleMosaic Construction The project will construct mosaic from set two images The project will modified handle larger sets images time allows The project will use transformation model including translation and rotation Hierarchical matching will used Matches will made first smaller subsampled images then refined Matches that minimize the sum squared differences will considered the best Greg SharpTexture Replication computer generated images objects and textures which are difficult model are often copied directly from scanned photographs large degree the success this technique depends upon the image quality the object the original photograph For example objects which are obscured have uneven illumination are not good candidates because information about the shape and texture the object missing distorted this paper present algorithm approximate missing distorted image information for textured object texture description recovered from object identifying texel properties such texel size shape density and orientation The region missing distorted image information then textured applying texture replication technique the region Mark SmuckerImplementation and Comparison Three Global Multi level Thresholding Techniques intended project implement three different algorithms for multilevel thresholding gray scale images and compare them various images The three methods intend implement are interesting because their relative newness and considerable differences approaches intend try and compare them the style done Lee and Chung for other global thresholding techniques besides summarizing and implementing them The first algorithm intend implement comes from the paper fast histogram clustering approach for multi level thresholding Tsai and Chen which computationally fast and efficient and should good baseline system test the other two algorithms against since does not attempt consider the global characteristics the gray level distribution The second algorithm takes connectionist approach while the third uses simulated annealing approach Besides the comparison report one goal this project provide code modules that will allow future students experiment with multilevel thresholding images Jon WeyersMultiple Baseline Stereo with Non Calibrated Views will attempt apply the Multiple Baseline Stereo method Okutomi and Kanade set three images taken from highly separated uncalibrated viewpoints This differs from the method described the paper two ways First will testing the performance the method using only two baselines the minimum number necessary for meaningful results Second will calculate the relative lengths the baselines from conjugate triples specified interactively the user rather than assuming the absolute lengths the baselines are known This makes the method applicable snapshots taken from unmounted camera will apply the method images made using the Apple QuickTake camera displaying results gray level map relative distances The exact distance would require exact knowledge the length the baselines
