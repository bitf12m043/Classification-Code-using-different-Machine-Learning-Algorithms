page help organize group Computer Science people interested the theatre specifically the Cornell Center for the Theatre Arts buy block season tickets and pass them out during the year someone can make one the days bought tickets for then help them sell their old ticket and buy new one also have few extra tickets this year for friends Each ticket costs the season subscription was you are known the Cornell Computer Science department and you are interested the theatre send mail jyh cornell edu and include you further mailings Season events for Power plays Seats are reserved the main Proscenium

subtraction multiplication division logical operations not and nand nor xor xnor shifting the rules for doing the arithmetic operations vary depending what representation implied LITTLE BIT ADDING overview carry sum carry out sum its really just like for decimal which binary sum and carry the sum and carry ADDITION unsigned just like the simple addition given examples ignore throw away carry out the msb sign magnitude rules add magnitudes only not carry into the sign bit throw away any carry out the msb the magnitude add only integers like sign sign result same sign the addends examples don add must subtraction one complement example wrong wrong right right seems that there carry out the msb then the result will off add again get the correct result Implementation called end around carrry two complement rules just add all the bits throw away any carry out the msb same for unsigned examples after seeing examples for all these representations you may see why complement addition requires simpler hardware than sign mag one complement addition SUBTRACTION general rules borrow unsigned only makes sense subtract smaller number from larger one examples must borrow sign magnitude the signs are the same then subtraction signs are different then change the problem addition compare magnitudes then subtract smaller from larger the order switched then switch the sign too when the integers are the opposite sign then becomes becomes examples switch sign since the order the subtraction was reversed one complement figure out your own two complement change the problem addition becomes get the additive inverse and addition examples throw away carry out OVERFLOW DETECTION ADDITION unsigned when there carry out the msb sign magnitude when there carry out the msb the magnitude carry out msb magnitude complement when the signs the addends are the same and the sign the result different note that correct answer would but cannot represented bit complement detail you will never get overflow when adding numbers opposite signs OVERFLOW DETECTION SUBTRACTION unsigned never sign magnitude never happen when doing subtraction complement never subtraction use the addition rule the addition operation done MULTIPLICATION integers longhand looks just like decimal the result can require many bits the larger multiplicand complement always get the right answer without thinking about the problem sign extend both multiplicands many bits the larger Then take the correct number result bits from the least significant portion the result complement example correct answer underlined not any representation take the least significant bits DIVISION integers unsigned only example LOGICAL OPERATIONS done bitwise AND NOR XOR etc SHIFT OPERATIONS way moving bits around within word types logical arithmetic and rotate each type can either left right logical left move bits the left same order throw away the bit that pops off the msb introduce into the lsb logically left shifted bit logical right move bits the right same order throw away the bit that pops off the lsb introduce into the msb logically right shifted bit arithmetic left move bits the left same order throw away the bit that pops off the msb introduce into the lsb SAME LOGICAL LEFT SHIFT arithmetic right move bits the right same order throw away the bit that pops off the lsb reproduce the original msb into the new msb another way thinking about shift the bits and then sign extension arithmetically right shifted bit arithmetically right shifted bit rotate left move bits the left same order put the bit that pops off the msb into the lsb bits are thrown away lost rotated left place rotated left place rotate right move bits the right same order put the bit that pops off the lsb into the msb bits are thrown away lost rotated right place rotated right place SAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOGICAL AND SHIFT OPERATIONS SAL has instructions that bitwise logical operations and shifting operations word OPERANDS not
