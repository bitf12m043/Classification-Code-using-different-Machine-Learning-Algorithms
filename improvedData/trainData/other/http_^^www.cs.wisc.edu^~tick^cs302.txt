class problem solving Good problem solving skills distinguish good computer programmer from bad one doesn matter how familiar skilled you are particular programming language you not understand how solve the problem then you will not able write computer program for any language help you learn problem solving skills and techniques will assign weekly pro blem solving exercises These will small but non trivial problems which give out each Monday You should look the problem and think about duri the week and right down the steps you would through solve the problem the overall structure your program This primarily exercise neral problem solving you not have write any FORTRAN ode though you may you want and have time and your solution algorithm ould not even dependent particular programming language such FORTRAN Each Friday will over the solution class Exercises Computer Lab You will using the Vectra lab Computer Science Statistics containing Hewlett Packard Vectra running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft FORTRAN This lab open from seven days week except certain holidays The printer room located across the hall You have quota pages which print Once you exceed that quota you must contact the lab either mail going room during office hours they prefer mail pay increase your quota You may also use your home dorm computers write your programs however you will probably have purchase your own copy Microsoft FORTRAN Lahey Personal FORTRAN see the inside cover the textbook You may also work any the other computer labs campus however most not have FORTRAN compilers please see first before using the CAE lab The software you will using the lab includes Microsoft Windows and DOSE mailNetscape Other Pointers Interest Home Page Jeff Lampert Home Page Computer
