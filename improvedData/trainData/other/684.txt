packages described here Hyperproof The Language First order Logic Tarski World and Turing World are all published the Center for the Study Language and Information and distributed Cambridge University Press Click here for ordering information you already own any these packages click here for date version information and other information interest current users Click here you have any comments suggestions questions you would like read new paper Barwise and Etchemendy describing the reasons they developed this software and how has changed their view logic check out Computers Visualization and the Nature Reasoning You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader read this file HyperproofHyperproof system for learning the principles analytical reasoning and proof construction consisting text and Macintosh software program Unlike traditional treatments first order logic Hyperproof combines graphical and sentential information presenting set logical rules for integrating these different forms information This strategy allows students focus the information content proofs rather than the syntactic structure sentences also reflects the heterogeneity information encountered everyday reasoning Using Hyperproof the student learns construct proofs both consequence and non consequence using intuitive proof system that extends the standard set sentential rules incorporate information represented graphically Proofs consistency and inconsistency are also covered well independence proofs The Hyperproof software checks the logical validity each type proof Hyperproof compatible with various natural deduction style proof systems including the system used the authors The Language First order Logic Hyperproof wonderful With you can construct and check proofs expanded version the language Tarski World And there more much more another whole dimension Hyperproof lets you use pictorially presented information and pictorially oriented deduction techniques combination with sentences and syntactic rules reason about its block worlds extraordinarily impressive programming achievement Hyperproof will make learning first order logic enormously more fun Carl Ginet Cornell University Hyperproof designed used first course logic Since presupposes familiarity with the program Tarski World should used tandem with either the textbook The Language First order Logic the stand alone version Tarski World Tarski Lite Hyperproof currently available only for the Macintosh Microsoft Windows version under development Ordering information Show Hyperproof Top Hyperproof Table Contents Information for current users Acknowledgements The Language First order Logic Mac The Language First order Logic presents new approach teaching first order logic Taking advantage the accompanying program Tarski World the text skillfully balances the semantic conception logic with methods proof The book contains eleven chapters four parts Part about propositional logic and Part covers quantifier logic Part III contains chapters set theory and inductive definitions Part contains advanced topics logic including topics importance applications logic computer science The Language First order Logic contains hundreds problems and exercises instructor manual and instructor disk are available accompany this book The instructor manual written Ruth Eberle provides wealth material make grading exercises and teaching from the text easier The instructor disk allows you grade most the Tarski World problems automatically directly off the student disks possible grade both IBM and Macintosh disks using the Macintosh version the program The Language First order Logic packed with interesting exercises and problems which make imaginative use Tarski World This excellent package and recommend highly the basis either complete first course logic initial part such course Doug Goldson Steve Reeves and Richard Bornat University London The Language First order Logic and Tarski World redress one the main shortcomings traditional beginning level logic texts which emphasize the formal aspects logic and pay scant attention semantics Tarski World sets high standard for those who follow Kevin Compton Journal Symbolic Logic The emphasis throughout the user doing logic working the many problems the text Recommended unreservedly fascinating approach fascinating subject Wernick ChoiceThe Language First order Logic comes packaged with the program Tarski World Since Hyperproof uses extension the natural deduction style proof system taught The Language First order Logic can used accompany this text The Language First order Logic available versions for Macintosh and Microsoft Windows version the software for computers running NeXTstep also available receive purchase copy either the Macintosh Windows version and follow the instructions contained the book Ordering information Show Tarski World Top LOFOL Table Contents Information for current users Acknowledgements Tarski Lite Mac Tarski World innovative and enjoyable way introduce your students the language first order logic Using this program students quickly master the meaning the connectives and quantifiers and soon become fluent the symbolic language the core modern logic Tarski World allows the students build three dimensional worlds and describe them first order logic They evaluate the sentences the constructed worlds and their evaluation incorrect the program provides them with game that leads them understand where they went wrong Tarski World available two ways either alone called Tarski World Tarski Lite part the logic textbook software package called The Language First order Logic Tarski Lite the stand alone package intended supplement any standard logic text for use anyone who wants learn the language The disk and manual contain over hundred exercises from very basic highly sophisticated you have had small amount experience with Macintosh and enjoy logical matters then you will almost certainly enjoy using just playing with this software for the Mac George Boolos Journal Symbolic Logic The authors are pioneers Tarski World the only program that know for teaching first order semantics and sets high standard warmly recommend Wilfrid Hodges Queen Mary CollegeTarski Lite available for Macintosh Microsoft Windows version the software for computers running NeXTstep also available receive purchase copy either the Macintosh Windows version and follow the instructions contained the book Ordering information Show Tarski World Top Tarski Lite Table Contents Information for current users Acknowledgements Turing WorldTuring World self contained introduction Turing machines one the fundamental notions logic and computer science The text and accompanying diskette allow the user design debug and run sophisticated Turing machines graphical environment the Macintosh Turing World introduces users the key concepts computability theory through sequence over exercises and projects Within minutes users learn build simple Turing machines using convenient package graphical functions Exercises then progress through significant portion elementary computability theory covering such topics the Halting problem the Busy Beaver function recursive functions and undecidability Version extensive revision and enhancement earlier releases the program allowing the construction one way and two way finite state machines finite automata well nondeterministic Turing and finite state machines Special exercises allow users expore these alternative machines Turing World delight heartily recommend James Moor Teaching Philosophy Turing World quite literally revolutionizes the way the fundamental theoretical issues computing can taught Keith Devlin The Guardian There not the slightest hint jargon anywhere Turing World The explanations are direct that beginner will understand them and old hand will enjoy them Wilfrid Hodges Queen Mary College The program and manual are the best introduction Turing machines the reviewer knows can imagine George Boolos Journal Symbolic Logic Ordering information Show Turing World Top Turing World Table Contents Information
