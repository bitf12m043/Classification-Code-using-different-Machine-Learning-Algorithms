Content type text html Section Doctoral ProgramSection Doctoral ProgramSection Admission The Doctor Philosophy degree indicates marked excellence research and superior comprehension the discipline computer science paraphrase Graduate College Section XII the University Iowa General Catalog Admission the program granted students who have demonstrated the potential for meeting this twofold standard Successful applicants must have superior academic records Computer Science solid scores the Graduate Record Examination and outstanding references from qualified people familiar with the applicant capacity and potential Early and direct admission into the program desirable The student need not have master degree when she starts the program nor need she acquire one Students who complete degree Computer Science The University Iowa should note that necessary obtain approval for change status order continue their studies the program The Department reviews change status request just does application for admission Change Status forms are available the departmental office Section Course Requirements Upon entering the program the Department assigns each student academic advisor and three person Student Committee The academic advisor member the Student Committee described Section changes the academic advisor may occur the current academic advisor always member the Student Committee The student together with their academic advisor and Student Committee selects course sequence which satsifies the departmental course requirements while preparing the student for the dissertation research the Qualifying Examination Presentation and the Comprehensive Examination The Graduate College requires minimum semester hours academic work beyond the bachelor degree students Computer Science must complete minimum semester hours coursework and semester hours dissertation research Research for Dissertation Some specialty areas may require additional preparation and more time research students should schedule their courses carefully consultation with their advisor and Student Committee Early selection special interest area desirable Students will assigned advisors according interest areas student interest changes but the student advisor can easily changed someone the new interest area Students who are unsure their long term interests should consult their current academic advisor and their Student Committee for advice their course scheduling and overall plan study some manner the student must have serious plan with emphasis the identification area specialization The Department has the following course requirements for degree Note that the only courses that can taken grading basis are those offered only that grading basis level Computer Science Courses Each student must complete the following five courses with grade higher With three the five higher addition each student must take four additional level courses approved his her academic advisor Note that specialty area may require specific courses early planning and advice important level Computer Sciences Courses Each student must take least semester hours level courses other than Research for Dissertation These semester hours may include most three semester hours Readings for Research III Outside Sequence The student must complete one sequence three courses with minimum grades least one which above the level selected from one the following areas study Algebra Analysis Logic and set theory Operations research Statistics and probability Numerical analysis the student selects statistics and probability the area study she may choose all three courses the level but the third course must the level above the student has satisfied any the requirements listed above including the outside sequence undergraduate she may petition the Graduate Committee waive the requirement The student may also use transfer credit satisfy the requirements but only the Graduate Committee approves petition that effect acceptance transfer credit the Graduate College not enough Petitions for waiver based undergraduate work transfer credit should specify the connection between the course here and the course taken elsewhere including course number and title textbook course outline when and where taken and grade received Petitions for different distribution courses for example substitution advanced courses mathematics engineering for level computer science courses may submitted the Graduate Committee addition the above course requirements registration Research for Dissertation course part the degree program noted earlier typically this will account for about semester hours The Department imposes foreign language requirement Section Qualifying Presentation Examination After completion the five required level courses the student selects topic for their Qualifying Presentation The student selects topic special interest the student after consultation with their academic adviser and Student Committee need not the eventual research area but the Presentation does provide the student opportunity explore potential research area and topic After selection topic the student prepares Prospectus for the topic and submits their Student Committee for approval The Student Committee reviews the Prospectus and the student academic performance using the departmental standard for students minimum gpa and completion the five required level courses with grade below and with least three grades higher The Committee either approves the student Prospectus requires the student further work before resubmitting Prospectus Contents Prospectus clear identification the scope the topic and the most relevant references careful statement the technical objective the topic study boundaries should established satisfy the guidelines constraints page report and minute presentation Objective student demonstration technical competence ability for independent work and potential for research upon completion the Report and Presentation the Student Committee will review the student overall performance The student may asked revise the Report and repeat the Presentation The Student Committee submits report and recommendation the student performance and qualifications the Graduate Committee Concerning timing ideal schedule for the student would have the Prospectus approved the beginning the third semester and make the presentation the end that semester The requirement which monitored the Graduate Committee that the Qualifying Presentation Examination completed the end the fourth semester the program See Section for the relation the Qualifying Presentation Examination the Final Examination the non thesis program and the Thesis Section Comprehensive Examination addition being Departmental examination the Comprehensive Examination required the Graduate College The objective the Comprehensive Examination assure that each student pursuing level research has sufficient breadth and depth knowledge within specialty area and superior competence and understanding computer science Expansion the Student Committee Upon completion the Qualifying Presentation Examination the student identifies specialty area The Student Committee expanded adding faculty the student specialty area minimum five members required but the Committee may larger This expanded Committee appointed the official Comprehensive Examination Committee and submitted the Graduate College the Chair the Graduate Committee Conduct the Comprehensive Examination After the student has completed most their coursework and other preparation for their dissertation research the student submits status report including proposed plan study and brief description the proposed area for the dissertation research their expanded Student Committee The Committee meets review the report and agree upon the form the Comprehensive Examination which may have both written and oral parts specification for the Examination and its scheduling decided upon the Committee and conveyed the student and the Chair the Graduate Committee that point official Plan Study and Request for the Comprehensive Examination submitted the Graduate College the Chair the Graduate Committee the preparation the specification for the Comprehensive Examination the Student Committee considers both the preparation for research and the breadth preparation for career computer scientist The conduct the Examination reflects both these objectives but within the context the student program student with broad plan study should expect more emphasis the question research preparation student with more narrowly focused plan study should expect emphasis their general competence computer science Residency and Status Requirements student must registered the University the time they take the Comprehensive Examination Also the Examination must successfully completed later than the session prior the session graduation student who probation cannot take the Examination Section Research Committee Upon completion the Comprehensive Examination the student Committee now becomes more narrowly based Research Committee The original members the Student Committee who are not within the student specialty area are excused from the Committee Additional members may added This Research Committee composed minimum five members least four from the Department Computer Science least three these four members including the research advisor should have interests the student specialty area interfaces between the specialty area and other research areas and one member from outside the Department Computer Science some point the dissertation research the student presents written dissertation proposal their Research Committee described Section This normally done after some research results have been obtained and the boundaries the dissertation can identified and described within the proposal The proposal must submitted and approved the Research Committee The Research Committee student must approved the Graduate Committee and officially appointed the Chair the Graduate Committee when the Request for Final Examination submitted the Graduate College minor technicality that the Graduate College requires outside member the Final Examination Committee but not the Comprehensive Examination Committee Depending upon the student specialty area the Research Committee may entirely composed computer science faculty and then additional outside member may added for the dissertation proposal and the final examination Section Probation and Dismissal Students the program must maintain GPA least courses leading the degree order for courses credited towards the degree the student must earn grades higher level computer science courses and courses the outside sequence and other courses course may only repeated one time attempting improve grade the student does not attain the necessary grade the Department will drop him her from the program The Graduate Committee will place student probation and notify him her writing the GPA falls below the minimum requirement she must make the deficiency within the next nine semester hours course work Otherwise the Department will dismiss the student candidate The Second Grade Only option applies only undergraduates Therefore computing student GPA the Registrar Office will include both grades for repeated course However when computing student Computer Science GPA for purposes probation the Department only includes the second grade for repeated course student probation not permitted take the Comprehensive Examination defend thesis receive the degree student permitted take the Comprehensive Examination the GPA higher Students wishing formal review their dismissal should refer Appendix Dismissal Review Procedure Section Credit Hour and Residence Requirements The doctoral candidate expected have completed least three years residence graduate college and minimum semester hours graduate credit The student must spend least part this residence full time involvement his her discipline this University beyond the first semester hours graduate work student can meet this requirement either enrollment full time student nine hours minimum each two semesters enrollment for least six semester hours each three semesters during which the student holds least one third time assistantship certified the Department contributing the doctoral program Enrollment Research for Dissertation acceptable toward this residency requirement The Graduate Committee will evaluate courses taken ten more years prior the comprehensive examination determine how much credit allow for such work The Graduate Committee will report its evaluation the Graduate College when the student submits his her Plan Study Section Post Comprehensive Registration The student required register each semester after passing the comprehensive examination until the University awards the degree student fails register she may not readmitted candidacy until submitting application approved his her advisor the Department Chair and the Graduate Dean The Department may require the student retake the comprehensive examination Section Dissertation Proposal and Dissertation Each student must write dissertation which significant original contribution the field Computer Science The student must submit written dissertation proposal the Research Committee after formulation the principal topics and questions The proposal should outline the context the proposed research the kinds questions addressed and the work that has already appeared the literature related questions should justify the significance and originality the proposed research The Research Committee will hold oral review the proposal Section Dissertation Deposit The student must present one copy the dissertation typed manuscript print the Graduate College for check formal characteristics prior the date specified the Graduate College the first deposit deadline After approval the Graduate College and the Final Examination Committee the student must deposit two final copies the dissertation with the Graduate College prior the date published the Graduate College the final deposit deadline See the Graduate College publication Requirements for the Graduate Theses for additional information deadlines and the required format for theses The student must also submit copy the Department which may published technical report Section Final Oral Examination After the student completes the dissertation the Research Committee acting the Final Examination Committee will administer oral examination which makes critical inquiry into the purposes methods and results the investigation and includes intensive questioning areas knowledge constituting the immediate context the investigation This examination may occur sooner than the session following successful completion the Comprehensive Examination and after the Graduate College checks the first submission the dissertation The examination must held within five years the completion the Comprehensive Examination Section Application for Degree The student must file Application for Degree with the Registrar not later than ten weeks after the start the semester one week after the start the summer session which the degree will conferred The student must have the application signed his her advisor Failure file application that date will result postponement graduation subsequent graduation Section Enrollment the Final Semester The student must enrolled during the session which the degree conferred Students who must register for the session which the degree conferred but are away from the University campus during that session may meet this requirement registering for independent study research thesis Doctoral candidates who have completed all work except the final examination may register for the post comprehensive registration described Section XII the Manual Rules and Regulations the Graduate College such registration appropriate Such students register under the Graduate College number Post Comprehensive Registration for credit Section Receiving Degree While the Program student whose ultimate objective degree and who admitted directly into the program the beginning his her graduate work may opt receive degree along the way such cases the student should still attain early involvement research and should remain focused upon the program Satisfaction the degree requirements particular the Final Examination requirement can done using the Qualifying Presentation Examination the Final Examination the non thesis program The Qualifying Presentation Examination can based upon work which being used Thesis this case the Thesis defense may combined with the PhD Qualifying Presentation Examination However prior approval the Chair the Graduate Committee required Another possibility use the Qualifying Presentation Examination intermediate step towards thesis this order has the advantage not delaying the qualification process until the thesis research finished student whose ultimate objective degree and who admitted directly into the program the beginning his her graduate work may opt receive degree along the way such cases the student should still attain early involvement research and should remain focused upon the program Satisfaction the degree requirements particular the Final Examination requirement can done using the Qualifying Presentation Examination the Final Examination the non thesis program The Qualifying Presentation Examination can based upon work which being used Thesis this case the Thesis defense may combined with the PhD Qualifying Presentation Examination However
