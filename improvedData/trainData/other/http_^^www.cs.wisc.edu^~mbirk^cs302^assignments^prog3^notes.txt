questions about the Hangman program Some people have had minor problems getting the string class work interpreting particular error message However others claim completely lost and cannot figure out how approach the problem writing program play Hangman Maybe didn prepare you properly for this assignment don think terribly hard assignment but may have rushed through the material the string class decided write detailed document describing how the assignment Much the code that you will need use your program given you right here all you have assemble into coherent structure and fill the details Note The code this document does not address small problem treating both upper and lower case letters the same Instead treats the two versions each letter totally different letters This not correct behavior for the assignment though You are responsible for modifying the program handle upper and lower case letters the user guesses the letter either upper lower case your program should reveal all letters the secret phrase both upper and lower case However recommend that you this only after you have the rest the program working Basic Implementation One way implement the Hangman game keep two strings the secret phrase and the partially revealed secret phrase The secret phrase initialized the beginning the program and doesn change The partially revealed secret phrase the same the secret phrase but all the letters are blanked out When the user guesses letter the secret phrase the corresponding letter the partially revealed secret phrase unblanked For example say the secret phrase Howdy Doody Then the partially revealed secret phrase will contain the string each the letters has been replaced with the underscore character Now the user guesses the letter then the partially revealed secret phrase will modified for each the secret phrase Howdy Doody the corresponding character the partially revealed secret phrase changed from the underscore character the letter Pseudo Code get random secret phrase initialize the partially revealed phrase initialize number chances display partially revealed secret phrase initialize guessed letters empty string loop until out chances secret phrase has been guessed ask user for guess not letter error Not letter else already guessed error Already guessed else add guess string guessed letters guess secret phrase message Good guess reveal matching letters partially revealed phrase else message Bad guess subtract one from number chances display partially revealed secret phrase secret phrase guessed message Congratulations else message Sorry secret phrase was secret phrase Get the Random Secret Phrase For this program you get the random secret phrase calling the function random secret phrase This function has the following prototype string random secret phrase This prototype tells that the random secret phrase function has inputs and returns outputs string call this function simply putting empty pair parentheses after its name random secret phrase However just wrote this line our program would call the function but throw away its return value This definitely not what want general must use the return value function some way For random secret phrase its return value string which randomly selected from list The appropriate thing with this string store variable can refer that value whenever need string secret phrase random secret phrase This creates variable secret phrase type string and initializes with the value returned the random secret phrase function call Initialize the Partially Revealed Secret Phrase The partially revealed secret phrase should the same the secret phrase but with all letters changed underscores Non letters such the space character punctuation should left decide character letter the isalpha function This function declared the header file ctype has the following prototype bool isalpha char This prototype tells that the isalpha function takes one input character and returns boolean value true false the given character letter returns true string partial phrase secret phrase for int partial phrase length isalpha partial phrase partial phrase This code loops over each the characters the partially revealed secret phrase each character that letter changed underscore Since know the number characters the partially revealed secret phrase partial phrase length can use simple counting loop use the bracket operator access each character the index variable tells which character are working Checking Whether Letter has Already Been Guessed decide the user has guessed letter previously you need keep track which letters they have already guessed This can done with string that holds all previously guessed letters the beginning the game this will the empty string Each time the user guesses new letter add the end the string decide whether letter has already been guessed use the function char string This function has the following prototype bool char string char string str This tells that the function has two inputs one character and one string and returns boolean true false value returns true then one the characters the given string the character you call this function and supply inputs the guess and the string previously guessed letters will tell you whether not the guess has been made before The function call will look like char string guess guessed letters But usual need something with the return value this function Since char string returns boolean value can use the return value the condition statement char string guess guessed letters Add Guess String Guessed Letters guessed letters guess Remember that the just shorthand for the following guessed letters guessed letters guess The character guess automatically converted string and the operator concatenates the two strings into single string Checking the Guess the Secret Phrase This step similar checking whether the guess had been made previously Use the char string function but instead searching the string previously guessed characters search the secret phrase itself char string guess secret phrase Reveal the Matching Letters the Secret Phrase When the user guesses letter which the secret phrase you must unblank the correct letters the partially revealed secret phrase changing them the guessed letter this looping over each character the secret phrase that character the same the guess then reveal the corresponding character the partially revealed secret phrase changing from underscore the corresponding character the secret phrase for int Checking whether the Game Over The game ends when either the player has run out chances has completely guessed the secret phrase The first condition can checked with the boolean expression num chances The second condition can checked comparing the secret phrase the partially revealed secret phrase they are the same then the player has won the game This can checked with the boolean expression secret phrase partial phrase The game ends when either these two boolean expressions true num chances secret phrase partial phrase However the game must continue long neither these conditions true Thus the condition our loop would while num chances secret phrase partial phrase mbirk wisc edu
