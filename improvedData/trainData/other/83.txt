Assignment Page PROGRAM DUE Fri noon part only This program will consist several parts with part due Fri Part due Noon You will write three FORTRAN Subroutines CMPXMP This procedure accepts four real parameters and returns two real parameters OUT OUT and are the real and imaginary components complex number will call and are likewise component out and OUT the output complex number CMPXMP will calculate This performed follows let represented then CMPXAD This subprogram also accepts real and returns two real parameters will interpret the first two did CMPXMP parameters the real and imaginary components complex number and the next two and the last two The procedure will complex add and return their complex sum Complex add defined follows let CMPXMD This will accept two real input parameters and return one real output parameter The first two will the real and imaginary components complex number and the last one will the return value real scalar which will contain the modulus Modulus way describing the size complex number the distance the point from the the origin the complex plane the real imaginary axes calculated let complex number modulus sqrt You should carefully document the program source using the BREAK subroutine one Page your text model Your external documentation should consist three sets one for each subprogram You will have description the subprogram the input parameters and their types the output parameters and their types and test PLAN You will responsible for writing driver program test the subprograms This may done one program for all the subprograms you may write separate drivers you wish Part due MidNight You will write three FORTRAN Functions and change one the above Subroutines Function Modify CMPXMD REAL function taking two parameters Write REAL function Rvalid MIN MAX PROMPT that prompts the user with PROMPT which string parameter then reads real input checks that greater than min and less than max returns the real value read otherwise produces helpfull error message and repeats the above steps MIN MAX are real parameters PROMPT string Write INTEGER fuction Ivalid MIN MAX PROMPT This function exactly the same above but MIN MAX and the function are INTEGER Write INTEGER function ARRGTR VALUE where REAL array reals INTEGER the array sizeREAL VALUE real number used search argument This function returns the index subscript the first array member that VALUE there such element returns That ARRGTR returns the subscript for the first VALUE Only internal documentation required You need produce clear statement what each function does and provide clear description the return value and the input parameters You are provide driver program test heartily recommend that you produce test plan not handed but guide you complete test the functions Please hand single script file sent message text compose message PROGRAM Assignment Almost finished with Fortran More parts follow are doing some FUN stuff now Server Dienst MIME version Content type text html The Multi procedure Equivalence Theorem The Multi procedure Equivalence Theorem David Binkley Susan Horwitz and Thomas Reps November Program dependence graphs have been used program optimization vectorization and parallelization They have also been used the internal representation for programs programming environments well for automatically merging program variants This paper concerns the question whether program dependence graphs are lqadequate program representation Previous results the adequacy program dependence graphs have been limited language without procedures and procedure calls Our main result theorem that extends previous results language with procedures and procedure calls The theorem shows that the program dependence graphs two programs are isomorphic then the programs are strongly equivalent How view this documentDisplay the whole document one the following formats HTML bytes You are granted permission for the non
