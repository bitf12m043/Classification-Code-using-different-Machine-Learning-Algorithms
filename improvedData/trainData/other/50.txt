GMT Using Mesa INTRODUCTION COMPUTER GRAPHICS Spring Using Mesa The Mesa OpenGL like graphics library has been installed for use the department public workstations There are two flavors public workstations available the Sparc Painter Hall and the IBMs both Painter and Taylor Mesa collection graphics libraries the MesaGL library the MesaGLU library the Mesaaux library and the Mesatk library These are embodied the files libMesaGL libMesaGLU libMesaaux and libMesatk respectively There also widget library that provides OpenGL widgets similar SGI widgets This libMesaGLw also plan offer the GLUT library from SGI but this has not been completely installed yet For all machines the libraries are installed lib Mesa There also set common include files used with these libraries include Mesa Documentation for the libraries found doc Mesa which has four subdirectories interest mangl manglu manglx and doc The first three contain man pages for MesaGL MesaGLU and MesaGLX respectively and doc contains papers describing these libraries higher level All these documents are postscript format which means that the man program cannot used read the man pages Instead recommend using the command filename read these postscript files The man pages are also available html the web There also extensive set demo programs available for you look and play with The source code for these can found src Mesa demos src Mesa book src Mesa samples and src Mesa widgets demos each these directories there subdirectory for each the deparmental machine types These contain executable files for the demo programs each type machine you should able verify that you can execute these demos whatever machine you are using Once you have done that try copying the source code for few the more interesting programs your own account and building the demos using the makefile NOT attempt use the makefiles the src Mesa directory tree they won work with the installed libraries and include files use our local makefile you will have uncomment the appropriate lines for the machine you are trying compile and you will have edit the PROGS line list the programs you are trying compile Note that the program names listed there are the object module names which should identical the source filenames with the extension removed Please report any problems you have this procedure email fussell utexas edu and your message the nishant utexas edu Also please try this soon you can that you will quickly learn how get around Mesa and will ready the programming projects You might want try these exercises several machines before you decide what use The IBMs are the fastest processors but will probably the slowest machines for using Mesa since all graphics will have done over the net from the server machines the Xstations All these machines run under Xwindows you should able run Mesa any machine with window any other machine the net This not recommended however since the net will become bottleneck Donald

chapter yourself but you should able this problem even without reading the text points Answer the questions from page Chapter the text You may want read this chapter yourself but you should able this problem even without reading the text optional Design Architect Training Workbook available line through BOLD Browser From this workbook the following lab exercises Lab exercises Module pages Lab exercises Module pages You need not submit this work optional Quicksim Training Workbook available line through BOLD Browser From this workbook the following lab exercises Lab exercises Module pages Lab exercises Module pages Lab exercises Module pages You need not submit this work points Design fully synchronous sequential circuit match detect pattern sequence digits This circuit has two input lines for the encoded input digits clock input and reset input The circuit has one output called det The reset input used initialize match all zero state Thus application reset high all the flip flops the circuit are set zero states occurrence the appropriate edge the clock the reset high the output det remains low irrespective the input sequence reset low det goes high when the above pattern found the input sequence and the circuit continues look for another occurrence the same pattern The output det remains high for least one half clock cycle see more this the next paragraph and then reverts look for the next occurrence for the pattern The clock signal has period and low from and high from All input signals namely the signals associated with the input digits and the reset signal change only the window the rising edge clock The output det must high soon the last the pattern arrives well before the next falling edge the clock and remain high till the falling edge the clock Design your circuit with appropriate state assignment Use fewest number states and state variables complete your design Remember that the circuit fully synchronous and the reset input does not reset the flip flops asynchronously Assume that the flip flops have small non zero setup time and zero hold time your submission include the state table provide the sate assignment schematic force files showing your test sequence and well commented Quicksim output for your test sequence Also submit clear documentation explaining the steps you used arrive the design Your work that submitted for this problem should more than five pages Thus provide all the necessary information reasonably compact manner with appropriate comments Course Account ece Wed Sep CDT
