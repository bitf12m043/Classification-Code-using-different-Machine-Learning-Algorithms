Project start How did the Condor project start Building the results the Remote Unix project that was directed Professors Dewitt Finkel and Solomon and continuation the work the area Distribute Resource Management DRM group directed Professor Livny the Condor project started Following the spirit its predecessors the project has been focusing customers with large computing needs and environments with heterogeneous distributed resources From the effort the Condor project inherited rich collection mechanisms and very sound software foundation The first version the Condor Resource Management system initially called the system was implemented joint effort between the two groups Bricker and Litzkow who were the time staff members the project The nucleus for the management
