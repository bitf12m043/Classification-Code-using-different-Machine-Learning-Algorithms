for Large Scale Mixed Complementarity Problems Comparison Algorithms for Large Scale Mixed Complementarity Problems Stephen Billups Steven Dirkse and Michael Ferris October This paper provides means for comparing various computer codes for solving large scale mixed complementarity problems discuss inadequacies how algorithms are currently compared and present testing environment that partially solves these inadequacies This testing environment consists library test problems along with GAMS and MATLAB interfaces that allow these problems easily accessed Eight different algorithm implementations for large scale mixed complementarity problems are briefly described and tested with default parameter settings using the new testing environment How view this documentDisplay the
