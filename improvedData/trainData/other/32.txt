coding this something you are not familiar with you should start early the project The projects will either PREDATOR MINIBASE few projects will stand alone and require neither system would rather you did the PREDATOR the stand alone projects since you will learn the most from these Those you who have done equivalent introductory database course should not the MINIBASE projects all the projects there will emphasis coding according established conventions documenting the code and code stability would rather have you write code that does few things well rather than many things very unstable fashion You should choose your project the October but encourage you earlier and start your projects There should not several groups working the same project topics Also where possible try match the projects your interests and your background Many projects need persons and you can find your own groups that ideal you want put you group with someone else can that either case early into the project you will need identify what each person going and you will graded individually the net result PREDATOR Projects PREDATOR client server DBMS built research prototype The main research purpose the system explore techniques support large number data types extensible manner meaning that should possible extend the system support fields new type like video image without changing the system significantly Part PREDATOR relational database system supporting subset SQL Most the course projects will either involve extending and enhancing the SQL functionality will involve adding support for new data type Add the OPT relational query optimizer persons Currently PREDATOR does not have serious query optimizer Instead just uses the join order provided the query This project involves incorporating the OPT optimizer into PREDATOR OPT independent library which can used customize and design query optimizer Work will involve finding out about OPT integrating with PREDATOR query evaluation and demonstrating query optimization simple join queries Develop query plan visualization tool and query execution visualization tool persons The purpose this project build graphical tool that displays query plan the result query optimization and also displays the execution that plan possibly displaying how the computation proceeding Add path and function indexes persons This project involves getting good understanding the way indexes are used query processing Path indexes are complex indexes which can implemented top the existing simple index functionality PREDATOR They are very important object oriented and object relational database systems this project you will need provide fully working path index capability specifying index SQL recording its presence the catalogs using the index applicable query optimization and actually retrieving from the index run time This project will give you very good grasp the internals query processing engines Evaluate the Wisconsin benchmark persons The Wisconsin benchmark industry standard DBMS benchmark that used measure the performance relational DBMS The project has two parts first implement GroupBy and OrderBy features that are currently not supported PREDATOR Second execute the benchmark and try enhance the performance whatever extent possible This invaluable experience you plan work performance related issues real DBMS Evaluate the TPC benchmark persons The TPC benchmark advanced query processing benchmark and some the functionality for this benchmark not yet PREDATOR This project will involve balance adding some functionality that some the benchmark queries run and improving the performance those queries Again like the previous project this good exposure practical benchmarks that people care about Implement image data type RIVL persons PREDATOR already has very elementary image data type This project will implement large part the support for images found RIVL Brian Smith multi media system with operations rotate clip overlap etc image Implement image data type Vision persons PREDATOR already has very elementary image data type This project will involve interacting with Ramin Zabih incorporate his feature extraction algorithms and use these extracted image features index the image data Implement video data type persons Add video data type with support for the various operations defined RIVL Brian Smith multi media system Implement audio data type persons This requires some knowledge audio data and the likely operations audio Audio data needs added data type along with manipulation functions Implement text document data type persons Add document data type along with NLP operations the document based Claire Cardie work This will require interaction with the NLP people Implement data type for chemical molecules persons Pharmeceutical companies have huge databases chemical molecular structures and much their research involves searching this database for spatial matches molecules This project will try support molecule structure data type the database Operations the molecule will based research that Paul Schuh and others have done this area The project will involve interactions with that group Build language embedding for PREDATOR persons Any commercial SQL system allows queries embedded inside host language like COBOL etc This project will build embedding PREDATOR SQL Integrate external databases into PREDATOR PREDATOR has extensibility mechanism that allows new query processing engines incorporated into the system This project will extend this mechanism integrate external databases for instance Informix server into PREDATOR Ensure multi user functionality person PREDATOR client server system implemented with multi threaded server However the multi user nature the system has not been tested and there are several problems This project will fix all the problems and demonstrate multi user capability Build full SQL compliant parser upto the level type checking and transformations persons The current version SQL small subset the ANSI standard This project will make sure that the ANSI standard SQL implemented the extent parsing and type checking persons work this some query transformations will also required this project Implement materialized views query caching with indexed retrieval For quite while researchers have suggested that the results queries can cached for later use executing another query This project will provide some portion this functionality Since this ongoing topic research this project must along with paper survey this topic MINIBASE Projects Implement trees Implement Hybrid Hash Join and Sort Merge Join Implement two new buffer replacement policies Implement tree Indexes Implement Hash based and Sort based Aggregation Other Projects Build data mining DBMS persons upto such groups Data mining this exciting new area that blends with databases The idea that there information patterns hidden database that are not very evident For instance from medical databases various statistical patterns can extracted empirical cause effect rules This project must with data mining paper survey The purpose the project implement some the algorithms suggested the literature and see how they perform Implement data clustering algorithms persons This another aspect data mining see above Here are looking classify large amount data into few groups clusters based some properties The point this efficiently Several algorithms have been proposed the literature The project will involve implementing few them Build standalone System optimizer and randomized optimizer persons Query optimization and has been very important topic database query processing this project you will build stand alone query optimizer using two three different approaches The purpose compare the alternatives suggested the literature This project must along with paper survey query optimization Build simple OLAP Line Analytical Processing system persons OLAP very refined form query processing that involves large amount precomputation answers The queries typically involve several aggregates and the answers are presented graphically Build OLE database components persons OLE protocol that Microsoft has developed top OLE COM allow multiple databases connect and interoperate This project will involve using this protocol build OLE compliant database components and will built using visual Since you will not have lot help Visual from the you should already familiar with this environment you plan take this
