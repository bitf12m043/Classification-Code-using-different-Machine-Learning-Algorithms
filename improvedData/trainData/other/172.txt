when routing datagram from one location another Motivated the requirements the many types emerging multimedia applications that will require dedicated virtual circuits investigate fault tolerant protocols for routing virtual circuits that both minimize distance and maximize bandwidth The protocols present are self stabilizing starting from arbitrary and possibly illegitimate initial state they converge legitimate state consequence this property they can tolerate changes network topology and link capacities consider networks where edges have positive capacities The flow path network the minimum capacity for edge that path maximum flow path path whose flow greater than equal the flow any other path with the same first and last vertices introduce the concept maximum flow tree network maximum flow tree network rooted spanning tree the network wherein the path every vertex the root maximum flow path present stabilizing protocol for constructing maximum flow trees networks make the following observation every maximum weight spanning tree maximum flow tree but the reverse not true observe that our maximum flow tree protocol has number advantages over any maximum weight spanning tree protocol also present stabilizing protocol for constructing maximum weight spanning trees networks Any maximum weight spanning tree algorithm alternatively minimum weight spanning tree algorithm Minimum weight spanning trees are very useful for implementing multicast computer network present protocol for routing and allocating virtual circuits along maximum flow tree virtual circuits are allocated and freed along the tree may lose its maximum flow tree property and thus may need updated present stabilizing protocol update the maintained maximum flow tree The protocol has the following desirable safety property while the tree being updated always remains tree Finally present flexible strategy for routing and allocating virtual circuits that minimizes the length circuit with respect desired set flow values The protocol presented also stabilizing Date Tue Jan GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Thu May GMT Content length file UntitledResearch Areas Chung Kuan ChengPartitioning Placement and FloorplanningRouting and Interconnect OptimizationSwitching Network DesignProf Chung Kuan Cheng research interests lie the following areas VLSI CAD partitioning placement and floorplanning routing and interconnect optimization and switching network design applied rapid prototyping systems using FPGAs Partitioning Placement and FloorplanningWe plan build hierarchical partitioning package Our system will able accept general formats such VHDL and XNF and has the options call several our partitioning packages perform the specific tasks The package groups components into clusters with the goal reducing the number inter cluster nets especially nets the critical path The clustering can also consider physical layout that the routability performance and power dissipation are optimized The phases clocks are also examined clustering ensure correct timing plan build performance driven floorplanning tool for building block layout placement addition considering maximum path delay layout area and aspect ratio the floorplanner will also accurately estimate and minimize the routing congestion that the resulting floorplan will have high likelihood being routable without further modifications addition the floorplanner will capable handling flexible and preplaced blocks and wide variety pin constraints Routing and Interconnect OptimizationAs further into deep submicron process technologies the traditional gate delay dominated delay pattern will replaced one that dominated interconnect wire delay Thus how route and optimize the interconnection wires the chip optimize performance becomes critical issue Recently moment matching has emerged promising tool interconnect optimization Moment matching useful not only circuit simulation but has the potential integrated with routing algorithms take care the constraints automatically are investigating ways incorporate moment matching and general circuit simulation into routing algorithms that this integration can smooth and painless possible Switching Network DesignIn board level emulation systems using FPGAs the switching network plays important role Its job interconnect the chips the board that the wire contention probability minimized The goal our research devise architecture that suitable for use rapid prototyping systems Current generation systems have stringent pin count limitations for the FPGAs result there are usually not enough pins for and this will cause severe problems for large designs Date Mon Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type text

hardware for new machine The memory addressing will have segments that are paged The machine has bit virtual address Each process can have segments and page size bytes The segment tables and page tables are stored main memory and can start any byte address Each segment table entry STE points page table Each page table entry PTE points page real memory Each PTE will also have read enable bit write enable bit and bit that set each reference the page This machine will support physical memories gigabytes Draw diagram this memory map Show how the pieces the virtual address are used reference each the tables and generate the physical address Indicate the size each field where comes from and where used Also indicate where page faults memory protection traps will indicated How large bytes full sized good idea have bounds field your STE Why why not Should this bounds field units bytes pages What happens double the page size while still keeping bit virtual address Problem Add TLB the memory mapping architecture that you described Problem This cache should way set associative and will have rows Draw diagram the TLB showing the size each field the TLB Indicate how bits the are used for input the TLB and describe the outputs from the TLB How often you need flush clear the TLB Why What change could you make the TLB avoid clearing Problem For each the following page replacement algorithms describe case where the algorithm does poor job scheduling memory LRU LFU FIFO Problem Consider demand paging system measure the various resource utilizations and see CPU utilization Paging disk Which these any should improve the CPU utilization Why Get faster CPU Get bigger disk Get faster disk Increase the degree multiprogramming Decrease the degree multiprogramming
