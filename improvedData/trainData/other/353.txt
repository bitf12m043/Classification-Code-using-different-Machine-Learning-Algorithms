must compiled under the same environment order use the package And your program should linked with atm garb use the garbler your program only needs follow three steps Firstly include the atm garb header file And instead using sendto send datagrams you must use the garb sendto routine provided atm garb The parameters for the call remain the same except that the len parameter must the ATM cell size Lastly when your program starts should initialize the garbler calling the routine garb init Garb init installs handler for the signal SIGINT and attempts set the garbler parameter values reading
