Computer Speech And Facial Animation Abstract integrating visual and audio information using computers new form human computer interface has been created The current research the design and implementation user interface whereby computer can produce speech audio and moving image human face synchronized the speech video The result the appearance human talking the user The program given text speak for proof concept purposes the numbers then creates the speech automatically determines the boundaries between phonemes synchronize the video and uses morphing smoothly transition between the images used for each phoneme PostScript copy the paperSample Output Video For Windows AVI format Zero One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Hello Professor Hill MIME Version Server CERN

macros lib tex macros How get TeX and dvips use fonts How print dvi file How get file Use the flag dvips foo dvi The above will create file named foo What good LaTeX book The LaTeX Companion Goossens Mittelbach and Samarin ISBN good book was able get copy from the University you know better one let know made own fmt file how get TeX use The easiest way this set the TEXFORMATS enviroment variable Let say keep fmt files pkn tex lib formats then would set TEXFORMATS setenv TEXFORMATS pkn tex lib formats That would search directory first and the the default directory lusr tex lib tex formats How get TeX use the macros lib tex macros You need set the TEXINPUTS enviroment variable setenv TEXINPUTS lib tex macros That will cause TeX look first then the current directory and finally the default directory lusr tex lib tex macros you want TeX look last put the colon before lib tex macros How get TeX and dvips use fonts You need set TEXFONTS the directory with the tfm files dvips need TEXPKS set the directory with the files How print dvi file With dvips you have the PRINTER enviroment variable set you can just type dvips filename Where filename the name the dvi file you don have PRINTER set use the printername flag dvips printername filename Date Tue Jan GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Wed Dec GMT Content length Administration and PoliciesCS Administration and

beginning class SAL Program Due Monday October before MAL Program Due Monday October before ProgramPurpose This program intended provide understanding the area data structures also gives programming practice MIPS assembly language code MAL Program Statement The program graphs integer solutions for some points line specified the user line can specified the equation The solutions this equation specify line cartesian coordinate system The program will have the user enter values for variables and will then find all integer solutions the equation where both and are greater than equal and less than equal will restrict the user entered values and greater than and less than simplify the code that does input Use array bytes hold all the points the grid find integers solutions test each point see solves the equation Where solution found mark the solution within the array that represents the grid The last step the program print out the grid Sample program run Enter and Another sample program run Enter and RequirementsWrite this program twice The first time write the program SAL Then translate the SAL code MAL The SAL version due one week before the MAL version due The user input restricted form make the code easier write The user enters integers all one line separated space characters end line character ASCII character directly follows the third integer Each integer allowed positive negative Negative values have character immediately preceding them there character then the integer positive Use only the SAL MAL getc instruction for reading user input The magnitude the integers restricted less than error checking need done the user input Write the program such that runs once and then exits not incorporate loop execute the program more than once Since part the goal this programming assignment gain experience using arrays the program must use two dimensional array store the solutions the equation for line Comment your program appropriately For the MAL version make sure that all instructions the program are part the MAL instruction set This means that all operands arithmetic and logical instructions will registers Points will deducted SAL instructions code are included the MAL version the program For the MAL version you will want learn use different user interface the simulator The user interface sim graphical gives much more information than simp Note that sim and simp are scripts that run the same simulator the difference the user interface presented The user interface that goes with sim shows register values and easily allows single stepping through code For detailed information read the document listed under Simulator Help the home page Handing the Program Turn your SAL program the SAL source code only once running the scripthandin program where program the name the file containing the SAL program The handin script submits your program for you printout will turned Turn your MAL program the MAL source code only once running the scripthandin program where program the name the file containing the MAL program The handin script submits your program for you printout will turned Homework points Show all work obtaining the result the following floating point multiplication The representation IEEE single precision except that the mantissa field the representation contains only bits Use round nearest for any rounding shortened points The fifth element array integers declared with int array word located address What address the data section would the the SAL instruction move int array access
