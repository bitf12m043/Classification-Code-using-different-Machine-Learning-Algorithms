Learning Problem Cynthia Thompson and Raymond Mooney Submitted the Thirteenth International Conference Machine Learning ICML This paper defines new machine learning problem which standard machine learning algorithms cannot easily applied The problem occurs the domain lexical acquisition The ambiguous and synonymous nature words causes the difficulty using standard induction techniques learn lexicon Additionally negative examples are typically unavailable difficult construct this domain One approach solve the lexical acquisition problem presented along with preliminary experimental results artificial corpus Future work includes extending the algorithm and performing tests more realistic corpus Corpus Based Lexical Acquisition For Semantic Parsing Cynthia Thompson proposal Building accurate and efficient natural language processing NLP systems important and difficult problem There has been increasing interest automating this process The lexicon the mapping from words meanings one component that typically difficult update and that changes from one domain the next Therefore automating the acquisition the lexicon important task automating the acquisition NLP systems This proposal describes system WOLFIE WOrd Learning From Interpreted Examples that learns lexicon from input consisting sentences paired with representations their meanings Preliminary experimental results show that this system can learn correct and useful mappings The correctness evaluated comparing known lexicon one learned from the training input The usefulness evaluated examining the effect using the lexicon learned WOLFIE assist parser acquisition system where previously this lexicon had hand built Future work the form extensions the algorithm further evaluation and possible applications discussed Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples John Zelle Cynthia Thompson Mary Elaine Califf and Raymond Mooney appear the Proceedings the Fifth International Workshop Inductive Logic Programming This paper presents method for learning logic programs without explicit negative examples exploiting assumption output completeness mode declaration supplied for the target predicate and each training input assumed accompanied all its legal outputs Any other outputs generated incomplete program implicitly represent negative examples however large numbers ground negative examples never need generated This method has been incorporated into two ILP systems CHILLIN and IFOIL both which use intensional background knowledge Tests two natural language acquisition tasks case role mapping and past tense learning illustrate the advantages the approach Acquisition Lexicon from Semantic Representations Sentences Cynthia Thompson Annual Meeting the Association Computational Linguistics Boston July ACL system WOLFIE that acquires mapping words their semantic representation presented and preliminary evaluation performed Tree least general generalizations TLGGs the representations input sentences are performed assist determining the representations individual words the sentences The best guess for meaning word the TLGG which overlaps with the highest percentage sentence representations which that word appears Some promising experimental results non artificial data set are presented Inductive Learning For Abductive Diagnosis Cynthia Thompson and Raymond Mooney Proceedings the Twelfth National Conference Seattle July AAAI new inductive learning system LAB Learning for ABduction presented which acquires abductive rules from set training examples The goal find small knowledge base which when used abductively diagnoses the training examples correctly and generalizes well unseen examples This contrasts with past systems that inductively learn rules that are used deductively Each training example associated with potentially multiple categories disorders instead one with typical learning systems LAB uses simple hill climbing algorithm efficiently build rule base for set covering abductive system LAB has been experimentally evaluated and compared other learning systems and expert knowledge base the domain diagnosing brain damage due stroke Inductive Learning For Abductive Diagnosis Cynthia Thompson Thesis Department Computer Sciences University Texas Austin July new system for learning induction called LAB presented LAB Learning for ABduction learns abductive rules based set training examples Our goal find small knowledge base which when used abductively diagnoses the training examples correctly addition generalizing well unseen examples This contrast past systems which inductively learn rules which are used deductively Abduction particularly well suited diagnosis which are given set symptoms manifestations and want our output set disorders which explain why the manifestations are present Each training example associated with potentially multiple categories instead one which the case with typical learning systems Building the knowledge base requires choice between multiple possibilities and the number possibilities grows exponentially with the number training examples One method choosing the best knowledge base described and implemented The final system experimentally evaluated using data from the domain diagnosing brain damage due stroke compared other learning systems and knowledge base produced expert The results are promising the rule base learned simpler than the expert knowledge base and rules learned one the other systems and the accuracy the learned rule base predicting which areas are damaged better than all the other systems well the expert knowledge base Date Tue Jan GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Fri Jan GMT Content length Computer System IntroductionDepartment Computer Science Computer System Introduction University Idaho Computer Science Home Page Univ Idaho Home Page Last updated July Welcome the University Idaho Computer Science Department student the department you will given account that you can have access the computer network the department Before activating your account you need familiarize yourself with the department Computer Use Policy well this document Computers are located Jansen Engineering Building JEB rooms and The following guidelines and procedures will provide you with the information needed use the network effectively quick look logging When you first sit down one the computers the labs move the mouse bring the login screen You will see the University Idaho Computer Science logo and login and password prompts Take the mouse and click the clear button before logging This will clear out any null characters the login field you login and get the message Login incorrect Please try again sure click the clear button before attempting login again Disk Usage There are disk quotas for accounts Instead each user can use maximum Most users should need much less than this classwork homework etc Each user expected monitor their disk usage and keep under control check disk usage your home directory and execute the command The number given byte blocks divide get kilobytes divide get kilobytes about MBs Disk usage monitored user can control their disk usage will controlled for them Man command Every new user will have questions about how commands work One the best commands learn about the man command short for manual learn about the command type man matter fact man man man man learn how the man command works Additional sources information about UNIX and other subjects can obtained from the Computer Services Help Desk located the basement the Administration building room These folks have put together some very good pamphlets covering number computer related subjects This also where you get account for the campus wide computer network Also remember that you have question and all else fails you can send questions help uidaho edu bobc uidaho edu Netscape Netscape available the computer network Netscape interactive hypertext interface the World Wide Web WWW the Internet run netscape type netscape The Department Computer Science home page comes you click any blue underlined text icon you will have used hypertext link another document Click item Students department see who has Web home page The best way learn about netscape browse around and look different students home pages any page you can click View located the menu bar the top the window and then click Source see how some users have built their home page Also note that there item the home page that refers UNIX tutorial Default files for profile mwmrc elmrc xsession and Xresources are usr local defaults You can copy these files your home directory and modify them you wish man profile mwm elm xdm learn more about these default initialization files change your passwd use the command passwd Try and use password that random string letters numbers and special characters that would difficult for password cracker break Any password that composed only words that can found dictionary list words password that can broken Remember you are responsible for your account and keeping safe from intrusion important remember that you are not the only person using the computer network Please conscious your actions and how they might affect others not turn the machine off not Don use pictures for background screens that might offend someone else Please keep the labs clean and aware that eating drinking allowed the labs you ever have question please feel free stop and visit with the System Administrator that room the basement JEB Have fun Bob Christofferson bobc uidaho edu Computer Systems Mgr Computer Science Department University Idaho Moscow
