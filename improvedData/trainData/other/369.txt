data structures and operations are based mathematical objects such vertices cells cell complexes chains cochains and operators such boundary and coboundary Together these data types provide the ability represent geometric shape other topological structure with algebraic formula Once topological geometric structure expressed algebraically becomes possible operate geometry and topology with rigorously defined algebraic operations which turn makes possible systematically compute topological and geometric quantities and properties Here example complex chain and their algebraic and graphical representations About the logo Quotation Chains theme song second audio What New Applications the Lanugage Multiple Domain Physical Simulation has been used create combined fluid elastic solid simulator animation one run the combined simulator showing the coupled nature the fluid solid interactions how the fluid pressure deflects the elastic solid which turn provides modified fluid volume Finite elements Cornell postscript version describes the use language for FEM The article presents two page formal specification FEM formulation plane stress using quadratic shape functions defined over triangles This program corresponds closely textbook derivation and yet efficiently executable Communication and standardization Parallel and distributed computation see Scientific computing and visualization The language formalizes the relationship between geometry form and physical behavior function which fundamental most engineering activities has applications computer aided design CAD scientific computing and distributed and parallel computation algebraic topological programming language Pal computer language that has algebraic topological objects such vertices simplexes complexes and chains basic data types The power lies the ability write expression that has evaluable topological geometric semantics This provides the ability program much higher semantic level The relationship between the language and algebraic topology similar that between the MATLAB language and matrix algebra between CSG and geometry Rick Palmer rick cornell edu MIME Version Server CERN Date
