Research Institute organization collaborating industry and academic scientists and engineers devoted research bringing computer science and computation technology bear problems engineering design DRI was established Cornell University and Xerox Corporation and located the Center for Theory and Simulation Science and Engineering the Cornell campus Ithaca New York The Institute was founded the principle that American research universities represent major resource that can and should employed America effort improve its industrial global competitiveness present five Xerox scientists form the nucleus DRI collaborating research with Cornell faculty students post doctoral fellows and visiting scientists the College Engineering Research problems are motivated industry but solved through the pooled talents and expertise the combined DRI community anticipated that additional companies and Cornell units will participate the Institute grows The DRI mission Pace Product that develop technologies and methodologies for accelerating the design and engineering technology based products DRI research currently encompasses three themes Information capture and access developing Corporate Memory Design heterogeneous information base capturing designs and design experiences and featuring high level query and browsing capabilities support engineering processes and decisions Computational Prototyping developing scientific computing algorithms and applications and computing environments for their use enable mechanical fluid and other physical systems simulated computer reducing the need for building hardware prototypes Collaboration technology developing tools and methods for sharing engineering information and creating shared engineering work spaces Since the issues engineering productivity addressed DRI are concern much American industry goal secure federal other outside funding support the Cornell associates DRI Industry staff are supported their companies Most DRI research non proprietary Software prototypes are implemented demonstrate concepts and show feasibility and results are published technical reports and journals appropriate technology expected freely transferred into partner companies DRI Partners The Design Research Institute partnership industry academia and government Industry Corporations can participate the Institute engaging the research DRI generally establishing groups research scientists and engineers campus Companies take the lead setting the research agenda and have access the research results all DRI Academia Cornell University the host institution for the Design Research Institute Faculty staff and students the College Engineering work closely with industry scientists collaborative research DRI offices and laboratories are located the Center for Theory and Simulation Science and Engineering and the Department Computer Science and collaboration extends the Sibley School Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and the Departments Electrical Engineering and Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Future involvement expected other units the College Engineering well the School Industrial and Labor Relations and the Johnson School Management Government anticipated that government other external organizations will fund part the research DRI since the research goal the Institute develop technologies that will enhance the competitiveness all American industry Such funding will support Cornell affiliated staff not industry staff Mission Accelerating the Pace Product Development The research mission the Design Research Institute develop technologies and methodologies for increasing the pace development technology based products such aircraft computing and communications equipment automobiles machine tools office equipment and composite materials DRI research expected lead ultimately shorter product development cycles This focus the time element engineering reflects the importance time market today global competitive environment Research projects seek leverage massive computation multimedia networks and heterogeneous database technologies enable more effective engineering both individuals and work groups Three themes form the heart the DRI research agenda information capture and access computational prototyping and collaboration technology Research these areas directed toward facilitating more effective engineering decision making and developing means eliminate accelerate engineering tasks Information Capture and Access One goal DRI develop technologies for enriched information and document environment that enables increased worker productivity project oriented tasks especially that engineering design DRI research information capture and access involves multitude technologies distributed databases and persistent object storage document image processing and management multimedia and user interface technology information science for heterogeneous data and knowledge representation and organization centerpiece for this work vision Corporate Memory Design distributed collection all the information pertaining product development documents drawings schedules catalogs field service records minutes meetings records decisions and histories past projects Initial contents the DRI prototype Corporate Memory will engineering reports scanned and synthetic document form engineering drawings photographs engineers along with records their areas expertise and project assignments and computational prototyping programs complete with documentation and sample visualization output The Corporate Memory will not centralized but rather will spread across many computers many sites linked network will closely integrated with public information sources such electronic libraries and national online databases The Corporate Memory will support wide variety uses through specialized interfaces tailored various applications For example engineer may receive automatic notification any engineering change his project electronic mail manager may have permanent project status window his her workstation refreshed program that continuously queries the Memory for schedule references departmental document scanner may automatically file the Memory all documents pertinent particular project Parametric design programs may sift through previous designs for best matches new requirements The application specific clients the Memory will all share layer intelligent access capabilities such near miss querying browsing natural language interfaces and self organization the content the Memory information capture and access testbed now being implemented based several existing information and document systems ranging from electronic notebook system network document and database access systems information filters and interfaces These systems will integrated into unified environment supporting experiments with and development enabling technologies for the Corporate Memory Computational Prototyping Computational prototyping involves the simulation computer complex physical systems and visual display their behavior engineers This process enabled high speed network access supercomputers high performance graphics workstations scientific visualization technology and new parallel computing algorithms will replace some the time consuming building hardware prototypes with interactive design the workstation Successful simulations have date been achieved several key physical domains including flow fluid and heat thermal ink jet print head free surface ejection droplet from acoustically excited pool liquid electrostatic interactions toner particles xerographic development system lubricant flow bearings and charge transport semiconductors New methods have been developed solve these problems supercomputers Ultimately the simulations will run fast enough for interactive use engineers emerging focus area Computational Prototyping Micro Electro Mechanical Systems collaboration with departments Electrical Engineering and Theoretical and Applied Mechanics computational tools are being developed that will lead improved understanding MEMS electromechanical behaviors Specific areas research include reliability and failure modes these structures well techniques for sensitivity analysis and optimal design MEMS This project being funded the NSF MEMS program research goal develop flexible powerful yet friendly environment supplying computational and graphics resources that enable engineer employ simulation everyday design tool The DRI vision integrated environment providing easy use simulation and visualization capabilities for engineers Xerox and other partner companies driven Cornell supercomputers Intelligent browsing capability and online documentation are key components the vision Building toward this goal Protolab computing environment for engineering simulation featuring automatic generation simulation programs from high leVel descriptions and object oriented library models and methods research proposal the development Protolab submitted jointly with General Electric and Cornell Computer Science has been selected potential funding candidate ARPA Collaboration Technology The Design Research Institute recognizes that the way engineers work together team important their individual contributions Thus collaboration technology forms the third component the DRI research agenda DRI activities this area are providing shared access objects the Corporate Memory and enabling effective communication among engineers Toward the latter cooperative engineering environment under development featuring structured dialog among members team facilitate resolution engineering changes during product design Research this area just beginning but expected grow involve analysis engineering processes and development additional tools facilitate collaboration special interest enabling effective teamwork among engineers separated several time zones Corporate Participation Companies joining the Institute typically will participate locating research staff campus the case Xerox the founding partner group seven scientists within the Corporate Research Group was permanently established Cornell Xerox provides Cornell yearly grant which offsets the cost its offices and support services Corporate partners benefit from participation DRI several ways The companies leverage both their intellectual investment and their financial investment through participation collaborative research with university faculty and students well scientists from other partner companies Government other external funding expected support the Cornell affiliates Through site collaboration partner companies have direct involvement establishing the research agenda the Institute Problems can drawn from industrial context and distilled into fundamental research questions This approach provides new scale and perspective that unusual academic research but which promises exceptional synergy Partner companies also have convenient first access research developments DRI including research involving scientists from other companies There are many avenues technology transfer including joint projects with off campus company units and hosting visiting scientists campus Intellectual Property Rights Most research the Design Research Institute intended open and non proprietary Results will available for use partner companies developed and will published scientific journals appropriate cover ownership rights inventions deriving from current DRI research intellectual property rights agreement has been reached principle between Cornell and Xerox provides that rights inventions Xerox employee shall covered standard Xerox policy and that rights inventions Cornell employee shall covered standard Cornell policy the case joint invention Xerox and Cornell employees rights shall jointly owned Joint ownership generally implies that each party has the right use license the invention independently either party wishes the case DRI joint ownership has been redefined the parties for the mutual benefit both parties When additional corporate partners join DRI the issue intellectual property rights will revisited but expected that agreements developed cover the new partners will similar the Xerox Cornell model Steering Committee and Institute Organization Policy for the Institute established Steering Committee whose membership includes representatives Cornell and each the partner companies present the committee consists three Cornell members and five Xerox members When additional corporate partners join DRI Institute office will created augment the offices the individual companies director expected named that time Until then Cornell and Xerox are sharing the administration DRI the Institute grows envisioned include separate branches focusing key areas DRI research The branches will engage various units Cornell and partner companies and government agencies may participate any all the branches they choose Design Research Institute Engineering and Theory Center Cornell University Ithaca MIME
