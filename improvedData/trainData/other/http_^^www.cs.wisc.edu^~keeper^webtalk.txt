specifications Internet RFCs and drafts WWW newsgroups Experience Personal Experience have been working with Web related programs for years Webmaster Caltech from inception November until August Implemented database search and entry tools using FORMS Installed most Web software packages available for UNIX Followed Web newsgroups from the beginning Currently the Webmaster The Origins the World Wide Web Conceived Tim Berners Lee and others CERN Designed foster communication between High Energy Physicists First specification called for hypertextual system Tim Berners Lee now with was asked design system that would allow physicists different parts the world collaborate projects and share information using the Internet after was decided that existing tools weren adequate Berners Lee decided use hypertextual model and then set out solve number problems posed that model First problem any hypertext system you need way point information objects you can carry the pointer instead the object Solution The Uniform Resource Identifier URI specification general specification that makes possible point any document anywhere Uniform Resource Locators URIs The URI specification defines way encapsulate name any registered namespace and label with the namespace producing member the universal set other words the URI specification defines superset all existing and possible namespaces Any namespace can given label and incorporated into the URI space Properties URIs Extensible New naming schemes can easily added Complete possible encode any naming scheme Printable URIs are encoded bit ASCII and are designed least partially human understandable and communicable Parts the URI specification URIs consist two parts prefix that indicates what namespace being referenced followed colon string with format defined function the prefix The extensibility requirement met the ability register new unique prefixes The completeness requirement met the ability encode any binary information the string following the prefix Base for instance The printability requirement left the implementation specific namespace encodings Special considerations and reserved characters URIs reserved escape character non bit ASCII characters and reserved characters can used URIs easily reserved delimiter hierarchical set substrings and are reserved they are used between characters indicate the current and previous level hierarchy respectively reserved separate URI from fragment identifier reserved delimit the boundary between URI and queryable object reserved shorthand notation for space real signs must encoded and are reserved for use with special significance within specific namespaces Relative URIs Reserving and allowed the specification relative URIs which work much like relative paths filesystem When relative URI found the URI the containing document used reference construct new full URI following these semantics partial URI starts with some number slashes the parent URI searched for the first occurrence the same number slashes and the relative URI substituted for the remaining part the parent provided that greater number consecutive slashes are the remaining part the parent Within the result all occurrences xxx are recursively removed where xxx and are complete path elements Examples relative URI substitutions the parent URI http www the following partial URIs result the listed full URIs http www http www http http www Note that using the parent URI http www would yield the same results Second problem Pointing the documents have now Now that have the URI specification need able point existing documents available the Web Solution The Uniform Resource Locator URL specifications one for each supported Internet protocol Some examples ftp ftp ftp wisc edu condor telnet telnet keeper notquite spacely wisc edu http http spacely wisc edu home htmlSide note Work the URN specification There working group the IETF attempting define Uniform Resource Name specification URNs are meant persistent objects regardless how machine and server configurations are changed URNs solve the same problem for URLs DNS solves for numbers Third problem Now that have pointers document objects need place put them Solution HTML the Hypertext Markup Language Design features HTML Defined SGML Document Type Definition allowing easy processing HTML SGML parsers Structural Markup Simple and quick render lookahead Human readable and editable special tools are needed create HTML documents HTML beyond the scope the talk Side Note Multimedia and MIME The original Web browsers used the extension file determine its type This method had several disadvantages single extension may used for more than one kind file File extensions not generally carry enough information allow identification file format human Not everyone will agree what file extensions map what types files fix this problem parts the existing MIME Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions system was integrated into Web clients and servers How MIME works Before document transmitted assigned MIME type the server mailer This assignment often made based file extension but because the assignment made locally the user can make sure the appropriate type defined The MIME type description the contents the file When the file received the browser uses the MIME type find appropriate viewer for the file MIME features New MIME types can added any time official organization exists register and distribute MIME types Several implementations either end the MIME system exist for many different architectures Fourth Problem How transfer documents from the author the user Solution The Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Any simple summary the features HTTP would ignore the serious changes its role precipitated other changes other WWW tools chronological summary the changes HTTP features more interesting HTTP The original features and purpose The first version HTTP distributed widely was The only request that could made was GET url where url HTTP URL with the prefix stripped The document pointed the URL would returned the browser HTTP was designed deliver documents with the lowest amount overhead possible FTP can perform the same function but requires costly login process HTTP stateless protocol Berners Lee saw that document would transferred and read and then link would followed another document possibly not the same server There was advantage keeping socket open HTTP Document Typing and CGI The next version HTTP was designed fix number problems with the previous versions and add new features The major change was the addition document typing using MIME related headers addition other Methods were included addition the GET method Some these were HEAD the same GET but only returns the headers PUT allows data sent the server stored under the supplied URL not widely used POST Creates new object based the data sent that linked the object specified the supplied URL LINK links object the specified object not widely used UNLINK removes link other information from object The most important these methods PUT which used conjunction with the Common Gateway Interface The Common Gateway Interface CGI and Forms Forms specification for creating fill out form within HTML document Each browser that implements Forms responsible for packing the information into special format when form submitted and sending specified URL CGI specification for script HTTP server that has its own URL When the URL accessed the script run and its output sent the client Used conjunction with Forms set scripts can carry dialogue with client Interesting note Because HTTP stateless CGI scripts often have play tricks ensure that the state conversation stored the document returned client Problems caused inlined documents During the development Mosaic one the programmers Marc Andreesen decided wanted add support for displaying pictures inside documents with every decision made Andreesen and the new Netscape Communications company since designed quick and dirty solution that served his needs and caused significant problems could blame other people Rather than find way encapsulating picture with document decided the most general model which was have the browser perform additional request for each picture This changed the model that Berners Lee had originally envisioned and created performance problems caused the overhead forming TCP socket Proposed solutions the inlining problem There are two proposed solutions the problem inlined documents Include multiple GET method HTTP which will require most two sockets created one for the original document and the other for the supporting documents HTTP which based top the Session Protocol Architecture and allows multiple low level virtual connections encoded top one socket The socket could kept open until the browser was finished with the server HTTP Proposed Additions the protocol Other additions include support for more advanced applications and for encryption sensitive data Care being taken ensure that the protocol will extensible
