accelerations descriptions processes animate objects There are several good reasons why you may want compute motion objects based forces rather than attempt kinematic description object motion often easier write expression for the forces object differential equation than directly describe the motion Dynamic systems based forces evolve automatically than the motion physically correct given the correct equations This automatic behavior relieves the animator attention lots boring detail For chaotic systems impossible write kinematic description Refer the section dynamics the page for more information about solving dynamic systems Three examples are shown here systems which would difficult impossible animate manual kinematic description Three body gravitation Water waves Billards impact system Assignment Download NbodyGravity net NbodyGravity cfg DLinearWave net DLinearWave cfg load macros and move your DXmacros directory NbodyGmacro net Bug After you donwload the NbodyGmacro net open and remove the Set module then replace with new Set module then reconnect and save The internal state the module seems messed Execute the programs understand their behavior then modify them follows Modify the NbodyGravity net allow other force laws besides inverse square Provide interactor set the exponent the law from inverse first power inverse fourth power Can you make stable orbit with just two gravitating bodies for inverse first power inverse third power force laws Modify the linear wave equation given program DLinearWave net simulate water making the acceleration proportional depth Refer the dynamics section for more information water waves Make the function which represents the bottom the region containing the water have some variation with position perhaps gaussian hillock Note correction missing minus sign was added exp When the modified program running correctly the water wave should slow down over the bump and will bounce off the bump above the surface Modify the water wave program you just wrote simulate cannon firing ball through the air and into water where starts wave Use Euler integrator for the ball and the given Verlet integrator for the water The ball should have initial conditions position corresponding the muzzle the cannon and velocity consistent with the cannon altitude angle with the horizontal and azimuth horizontal direction You should able set the altitude and azimuth the cannon via interactors which means you will have detect where and when the ball hits the water surface which flat until the ball hits You will need figure out how notify the water simulation that the ball hit perhaps adding sudden velocity the water where the ball hit There should interactors set the force gravity the ball and the air drag coefficient For the ball assume that where are the components the velocity and the components the accelaration prepared demo the two programs section You will also need demonstrate mpeg movies final results including orbit any inverse first power field One paticular cannon shot into the water You should able explain your programs You should use transmitters receivers macros and comments the Notation field each module that you and the grader can understand the program Control panels any should well organized labeled and with the appropriate numeric ranges Some results from The Lab grading

extension classical work designing Universal Logic Modules ULM Specifically give technique design class logic modules that specialize large number functions under complementations and permutations inputs bridging inputs and assignment inputs Thus lot functions can implemented using single logic module The significance our work lies our ability generate large set such logic modules choice can made from this set based design criteria demonstrate the technique generating set input functions that have much higher coverage than the input cells employed Actel FPGAs Our functions can specialize times the number functions that Actel functions can also show that carefully optimizing these functions one can obtain multilevel implementations them that have delays within the delays Actel modules demonstrate the effectiveness these modules mapping benchmark circuits observed reduction area and reduction delay using our logic modules instead Actel these circuits Contact thakur utexas eduShashidhar Thakur and Wong Series Parallel Functions and FPGA Logic Module DesignACM Transactions Design Automation Electronic Systems January The need for two way interaction between logic synthesis and FPGA logic module design has been stressed recently Having logic module that can implement many functions good idea only one can also give synthesis strategy that makes efficient use this functionality Traditionally technology mapping algorithms have been developed after the logic architecture has been designed follow dual approach focusing specific technology mapping algorithm namely the structural tree based mapping algorithm and designing logic module that can mapped efficiently this algorithm known that the tree based mapping algorithm makes optimal use library functions each which can represented tree AND and NOT gates series parallel functions show how design function with minimum number inputs that can implement all possible functions with specified number inputs For instance demonstrate input function that can implement all input functions Mapping results show that the average the number blocks this function needed map benchmark circuits less than that for Actel ACT logic modules Our logic modules show improvement over ACT the block count scaled take into account the number transistors needed implement different logic modules Contact thakur utexas edu
