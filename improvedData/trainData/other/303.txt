less large the other They all have the same surname because they originated from the same Mitsubishi Zaibatsu that started back the early Those you who want contact Japan see card still under

decimal encoding for integers that uses one half byte per decimal digit Within those four bits codes represent the digits through and codes not repre sent digits Business computers used this encoding the and many computers still support this encoding today The advantage packed decimal encoding that input and output conversion are much faster than with binary integer encoding The disadvantage that arithmetic slower Thus most often used for data processing applications with lots and little computation See page Sign and magnitude The high order bit represents sign for positive for negative and the other bits represent the magnitude Thus negative and positive One complement The representation positive number the same for sign and magnitude The representation negative number the bit wise complement the corresponding positive number Thus The advantage any complement encoding that subtraction can done complementing and adding The high order bit can interpreted sign but not treated differently from any other bit the arithmetic hard ware Thus cheaper implement than sign and magnitude representa tion The disadvantage one complement that there are two represen tations for zero positive and negative zero Also during addition operation carry off the left end must added back the right end Two complement The representation positive number the same for sign and magnitude The representation negative number the bit wise complement the corresponding positive number plus Thus This representation has all the advantages comple ment encoding but none the disadvantages there only one zero and carries off the left end may ingored See pages floating point number has two parts the exponent and the mantissa Both are signed numbers According the IEEE standard floating point numbers can single length bytes double length bytes Problems sometimes arise because this approximate encoding many dif ferent external real numbers may represented the same internal float ing point encoding four byte number can only represent about decimal places accurately before truncation must happen Arithmetic operations can increase the size the truncation error Invalid results can happen when the programmer expects exact answers when numbers vastly different magnitude are used together See pages The largest bit integer The largest positive floating point number The exponent not because that code reserved for overflow error conditions Negtive one half floating point The smallest positive float closest zero The exponent not because that code reserved for zero and underflow conditions The negative floating point number with the greatest magnitude See page Simula pioneered the major idea now associated with object oriented programming that type should grouped together class with the functions that operate them CHAPTER See page external object the real world thing that being modelled The program object the string bits that represents the external object within program storage object series memory locations which the program object can stored pointer value the address storage object pointer variable storage object that can store the address storage object Both pointer values and pointer variables are pointer objects See page pointer variable storage object that can store address The term variable more general includes both pointer variables and storage objects that store ordinary data values See page dereference FETCH the value from storage object See page the following examples assume that integer array integers pointer integer pointer structure consisting string name and teger age function that takes one integer argument Language explicit Implicit dereference Pascal age has VAR parameter age printf See pages TYPE list cell cell RECORD value integer
