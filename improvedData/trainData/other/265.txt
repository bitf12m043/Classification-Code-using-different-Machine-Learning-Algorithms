DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM AND APPLYING COMPUTATIONAL ABSTRACT ALGEBRA Paul Bernard Jackson Cornell University This thesis describes substantial enhancements that were made the software tools the Nuprl system that are used interactively guide the production formal proofs Over lines code were written for these tools Also corpus formal mathematics was created that consists roughly definitions and theorems Much this material foundational nature and supports all current work Nuprl This thesis concentrates describing the half this corpus that concerned with abstract algebra and that covers topics central the mathematics the computations carried out computer algebra systems The new proof tools include those that solve linear arithmetic problems those that apply the properties order relations those that carry out inductive proof support recursive definitions and those that sophisticated rewriting The rewrite tools allow rewriting with relations differing strengths and take care selecting and applying appropriate congruence lemmas automatically The rewrite relations can order relations well equivalence relations they are order relations appropriate monotonicity lemmas are selected These proof tools were heavily used throughout the work computational algebra Many examples are given that illustrate their operation and demonstrate their effectiveness The foundation for algebra introduced classes monoids groups rings and modules and included theories order relations and permutations Work finite sets and multisets illustrates how quotienting operation hides details datatypes when reasoning about functional programs Theories summation operators were developed that drew indices from integer ranges lists and multisets and that summed over all the classes mentioned above Elementary factorization theory was developed that characterized when cancellation monoids are factorial abstract data type for the operations multivariate polynomial arithmetic was defined and the correctness implementation these operations was verified The implementation similar those found current computer algebra systems This work was all done Nuprl constructive type theory The thesis discusses the appropriateness this foundation and the extent which the work relied Last Modified Jan Paul Jackson jackson cornell edu MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content

probably travelling around the pages available the Web clicking links other people have provided get your instructor page for example you may have been going through other pages first You don have this You can make your own links Then going desired page requires only one step Making hotlist The easiest way make your own links use hotlist When you are page which you want one step link you can select from the Navigate menu the item Add Current Hotlist This will add the page hierarchical menu accessible from the Starting Points menu item Home Pages Whenever you want return this page you can just select from this Home Pages hierarchical menu Changing the first page you see your directory file called MOSAIC INI Make backup copy the file case something goes wrong Then double click the file from the File Manager The file opened editor One line the file reads Home Page http www wisc edu You can change this another page For example make the first page the home page first that page Mosaic the Mosaic window above the page line text identified Document URL The URL should http www wisc edu html You can change the home page line MOSAIC INI read Home Page http www wisc edu html Oct Andy
