Summary Objectives and Approach provide prototyping based design methodology that supports the architecture independent development parallel and distributed systems The Proteus system provides the language and tools supporting this methodology This work addresses fundamental problem naive implementations abstract models parallel computation lead impractical implementations whereas machine specific models lead intractable analysis even the simplest programs The goal our work provide tools for exploring the design space parallel application process prototyping and successive refinement Detailed Summary Technical Progress Development object oriented mechanisms for task parallel communication and synchronization Significant progress has been made language design the development extensible foundation for explicit task parallelism Communication through shared object model which the access shared state controlled through object methods and class directives which constrain mutual exclusion methods GPR Predefined classes such for single assignment objects which synchronize producer with consumer together with provisions for private state with barrier synchronization allow the expression wide range parallel computing paradigms key providing expressive and uniform vehicle for refinement Development methodology for performance prediction which computing model varies with level refinement development improved computational model LogP HMM support early analysis program efficiency and resource utilization are developing methodology for performance predicition which uses program refinement progresses increasingly detailed parallel computational models The accuracy and confidence assessment thus increases the level architectural detail incorporated into the program increases support the assessment multi paradigm programs different models are used for analysis code segments following different paradigms such the VRAM for data parallelism and the LogP message passing with suitable instrumentation attach the model the program the same time support more accurate modeling costs such cache and are developing improved performance models new hybrid model parallel computation the LogP HMM model LMR which fills gap the hierachy refined models extending network model the LogP with sequential hierarchical memory model the HMM Completion and release the DTRE transformation system The refinement subsystem Proteus called DTRE has been completed This system has supported work transformation data parallel Proteus programs vector models new system called Specware which significantly generalizes DTRE being developed addition supporting refinement and generation and Lisp code Specware has powerful category theory based operations for manipulating diagrams directed graphs logical theories The logical theories are used hierarchically define partial specifications architectural descriptions refinements and other software artifacts The operations are used compose refine and instantiate components build systems preliminary version the Specware has been released Participation the Hiper GeoServer demonstration activity November participated community wide prototyping experiment defined the Hiper program NSWC part their next generation Aegis development effort Using Proteus developed series prototypes explore design approaches geometric classification problem initial design was elaborated reflect the functional structure the radar system and the interactions with system operator Another prototype explored designs for the system demanding high traffic situations using sophisticated parallel algorithm All prototypes were executable using the Proteus interpreter were rapidly developed and were judged have contributed useful knowledge about design options NSWC external review the participating ProtoTech languages this experiment assigned the highest overall score the Proteus and Haskell efforts PLANS Full development
