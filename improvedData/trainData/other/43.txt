Interactive Lines and Curves Due October You are create interactive program for drawing and erasing line segments circles and quadratic curves using Bresenham line and circle drawing algorithms and the recursive Bezier spline curve algorithm given class Line segments should specified giving two endpoints the screen using mouse Circles can specified with center and point the circle two points defining diameter another means you prefer Quadratic curves should specified polyline that sequence control points given the mouse There must least three control points provided there are more than three then new implicit control points must generated provide the correct number For instance for four control points input new point midway between the second and third control point must created the shared control point for two consecutive parabolic segments For more than four generate this new control point midway between the second and third control points then generate another one midway between the third and fourth control points etc until you have split every original line segment between input control points except the first and last half with the new generated control points You will then have set control points which can used draw smooth quadratic curve fitting the entire sequence control points not use floating point arithmetic for drawing any these primitives You should able erase any primitive selecting one its control points addition doing the drawing specified above Your program should implemented Tcl widget equivalent should able handle window expose and resize events and redraw all the primitives user command You should not try eliminate holes created the drawing any means other than allowing the user redraw MIME Version Server CERN pre Date Wednesday Jan
