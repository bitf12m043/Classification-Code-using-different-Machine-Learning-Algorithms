recently introduced intermediate representation form for programs this paper develop mathematical semantics for these graphs interpreting them data flow graphs also study the relation between this semantics and the standard operational semantics programs show that the semantics the program representation graphs more defined than the program semantics and that for states which program terminates normally the PRG semantics identical the program semantics How view this documentDisplay the whole document one the following formats PostScript bytes compressed disk will sent uncompressed Print
