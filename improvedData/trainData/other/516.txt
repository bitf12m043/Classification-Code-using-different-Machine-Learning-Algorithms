Coordinator James Flanagan Rutgers Introduction The research the adaptive voice mimic aims advance fundamental understanding human speech generation and coalesces the problems speech synthesis speech recognition and low bit rate speech coding into compact parametric framework its core the mimic system utilizes optimization techniques and computationally intensive model speech generation provide high quality estimate moment moment articulatory parameters from acoustic speech signal The estimation articulatory parameters accomplished through two step process open loop table look based initial estimation followed closed loop optimization refinement Articulatory Shape Estimation Starting from acoustic input the open loop with optimization estimate the articulatory parameters obtained via table look precomputed synthetic speech representations Each element the table stored with the articulatory parameters from which was produced The input speech compared with the synthetic speech the table via spectral representation and the articulatory shape corresponding the closest synthetic speech selected Once initial articulatory estimates are found for series speech segments dynamic programming module provides smooth articulatory trajectories imposing articulatory constraints This concludes the open loop process The open loop estimates initialize closed loop optimization suggesting starting position which likely the vicinity the global optimal solution Effective open loop estimates reduce the computation required the computationally costly optimization loop Within the closed loop optimization synthetic speech generated from compact set articulatory parameters and compared with the input speech using perceptually weighted distance metric The articulatory parameters are iteratively adjusted based the result the comparison that the weighted spectral distance between the arbitrary speech input and the synthetic speech driven below preset threshold III Articulatory Speech Synthesis part this research two methods high quality speech synthesis from articulatory parameters are studied The first method based linear acoustic theory models speech production and the second method based fluid dynamic formulation The techniques for the first method are relatively well established but the method assumes plane wave propagation inside the vocal tract and also neglects most the non linear terms the other hand the second new method attempts capture more accurately the physics behind human speech production This done formulating the speech production process fluid dynamic phenomenon The approach uses form the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes RANS equations describing fluid motion numerically solve for low Mach number compressible flow vocal tract geometries Physical experiments from which real flow quantities are acquired support the computational approach validating numerical results Both linear acoustic and fluid dynamic synthesis use vocal tract shapes defined means articulatory models Two models have been used Tracttalk Lin and the Flanagan Ishizaka model Ishizaka Both models provide stylized vocal tract shapes defined compact set parameters These parameters quantify the position and shape articulators For example the parameters primarily used this study specify the location and size the main constriction the vocal tract the mouth aperture and the cross sectional area the front cavity These parameters are shown the schematic below The Flanagan Ishizaka Vocal Tract ModelIV AchievementsIV Vowel Recognition Using spectral representation based linear predictive poles and reduced number articulatory parameters vowel recognition system based articulatory representation speech signals has been designed contrast the articulatory based approach traditional speech recognition systems have relied spectral and cepstral features Despite considerable efforts seeking more accurate compact and reliable features for robust speech recognition the articulatory representation speech has not been exploited due the difficulty and computational intensity involved estimating articulatory parameters from speech waveforms Adaptive voice mimic with optimized open loop steering and efficient closed loop control provides promising solution the challenge nearly real time laboratory prototype the articulatory based recognition system has been implemented and demonstrated The system can recognize both isolated vowels and vowel strings recognition accuracy more than obtained During the recognition computation dynamically changing sagittal profiles the vocal tract corresponding the input speech are displayed The figure below shows the main displays the recognition prototype The Voice Mimic Articulatory Based Vowel Recognition SystemIV Speech Coding The articulatory representation one the most promising technique for high quality very low bit rate speech coding thought that such representation can produce speech coders below kbits per second Thus the importance acoustic articulatory mapping for the purpose coding apparent The adaptive voice mimic research has also produced coding system for vowels and fricative consonants such the sea and fire was found that spectral comparison based the poles linear prediction which works excellently for vowels does not work equally well for fricatives The major reason being that for the fricatives there are number bound pole zero pairs result linear prediction fails provide accurate estimates these singularities Therefore other feature representations have been explored The cepstrum representation was chosen since relatively compact and produces positive results order complete the extension the voice mimic system fricative sounds improved initial estimation source parameters has been designed include efficient voiced unvoiced decision Evident discrepancies exist the frequency content between sounds produced source the glottis vibration vocal cords and sounds produced noise source constriction the vocal tract the case for fricatives These discrepancies make necessary the use multiple codebooks The appropriate codebook selected based the voiced unvoiced decision The estimation articulatory parameters then completed the open loop steering followed closed loop analysis This system has produced vowel consonant vowel utterances and short sentences very encouraging quality Below are some coding examples from the voice mimic where the articulatory parameters from the input speech have been used synthesize the speech

Physiological information about particular speaker vocal tract hidden their speech signal Acoustic articulatory mapping provides means extract this information and use differentiate speakers particular vocal tract parameters can used supplement traditional speaker identification methods The advantage vocal tract parameters that they are not affected emotion sickness and they cannot easily altered for the purpose impersonation Preliminary experiments have been done towards the estimation the vocal tract length from the acoustic signal This critical parameter for differentiating talkers speaker identification verification tasks The estimation performed using the voice mimic system and two step strategy First the shape the vocal tract determined using codebook built fixed vocal tract length Then the vocal tract length estimated using detailed codebook comprising variations the same shape with length stretched and compressed Although such approach requires advance knowledge which sound produced this problem will overcome the future replacing the second codebook optimization loop Initial results have been obtained using database which associates ray images the vocal tract and the corresponding speech signal produced shown that the vocal tract length estimated the voice mimic system agrees well with the measured value PublicationsG Richard Goirand Sinder Flanagan Simulation
