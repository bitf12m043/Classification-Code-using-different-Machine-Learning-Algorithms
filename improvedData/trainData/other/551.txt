methods cellular automata and partial differential equations Procedure Download SurfaceTension net SurfaceTension cfg FFTtextures net FFTtextures cfg Reaction net Reaction cfg Fourier Transform Textures The program FFTtexture net takes input array points user defined pixels then computes the Fourier transform the points Since the output the FFT complex the program allows the user choose either the phase magnitude real part imaginary part scales the result and displays Transform texture examples Cellular Automaton Textures The program SurfaceTension net which simulates the effect surface tension Areas tend get smoother rounder and less fragmented mpeg animation shows typical evolution The rule for this Sum the nearest neighbors each cell and the cell itself cells are binary valued the sum less than equal set the cell zero Otherwise set one Reaction Diffusion Textures The program Reaction net simulates chemical reaction coupled diffusion There are two reacting chemicals called red and blue You can think these chemically reacting inks The inks can also spread across the paper different rates refered their diffusion constants Many different behaviors can simulated changing the chemical reactions and specific parameters One specific reaction scheme described below results this dynamically changing texture Red diffusion constant Dred Blue diffusion constant Dblue Red initial concentration random with maximum Blue initial concentration the Letters Test Diff polygon font step time NewRed concentration red red blue red Dred Del red NewBlue concentration blue red blue blue Dblue Del blue Where Del the sum the second partial derivitives concentration with respect and described the Water wave section the dynamics description the second derivitive operators are calculated using the Filter module Another example uses the same reaction kinetics above but the initial condition blue dots Assignment Execute the programs understand their behavior then modify them follows Modify the program SurfaceTension net compute version percolation cluster percolation cluster set cells which are connected initial group cells The automaton rule for each time step Sum the nearest neighbors each cell cells are binary valued Test find out the current cell has ever been visited before Compute random number for the current cell the sum greater than zero least one neighbor and the random number exceeds threshold value and the cell has never been visited before then set the cell one the sum greater than zero least one neighbor and the random number does not exceed threshold value set the visited flag for the cell Correction Below example percolation cluster using stroke font initial condition The threshold probability for each cell was set for the first three time steps then changed mpeg animation the cluster growth shows its evolution Extend SurfaceTension net Now there nearest neighbors You will have change the thresholds appropriate values the array may rendered connecting isosurface module with second input set then image module Use this code fragment map the array the surface torus The Mark compute Unmark scales object lie inside the volume The wire entering from the left floated version the array This mpeg animation shows the array the left isosurface rendered and the array used control the color torus Build simulator which fills array one row time Assume neighborhood extending one cell each side the current cell You might use the ForEachN module control the loop which causes the program visit each row once Assuming that the rule based summing the cells try several rules This mpeg animation based the rule sum newState sum newState sum newState sum newState Modify Reaction net include component The should take initial conditions the thresholded blue concentration The rule should Conway game life Life based the rule where sum over the membered neighborhood sum newState sum newState oldstate sum sum newState The should coupled back into the reaction diffusion equations source term for blue for red with interactor control the strength each source for each cell there needs term the NewRed and NewBlue equations the form strength Where the value the automaton cell Use text initial conditions Make MPEG animation your favorite reaction texture resulting from this process One example shows this process with source strength for blue and for red and using text initial condition for the Another example shows process with source strength for blue and for red and using two strips initial condition for the For both these examples the reaction equations were the same above except that Red diffusion constant Dred Blue diffusion constant Dblue prepared demo the modified programs show The percolation The The The reaction diffusion program modified include Some results from You should able explain your programs You should use transmitters receivers macros and comments the Notation field each module that you and the grader can

module environments contrast with treating global routing and layer assignment separately our method assigns nets layers while considering preferable global routing topologies simultaneously take

Crosstalk for Three Layer VHV Channel Routing Proceedings the IEEE International Symposium Circuits and Systems April With the increasing density VLSI circuits the interconnection wires are getting packed even closer This has increased the effect interaction between these wires circuit performance and hence the importance controlling crosstalk consider the gridded channel routing problem where specifically the channel has routing layers the VHV configuration Given horizontal track assignment for the nets present optimal algorithm for minimizing the crosstalk between vertical wiring segments the channel finding optimal vertical layer assignment for them show algorithm that minimizes total crosstalk between between wires the same layer adjacent columns the grid log time using memory where the channel has columns then extend this algorithm consider crosstalk between wires non adjacent columns and between wires different layers Contact thakur utexas edu Date Wednesday Jan GMT Server NCSA
