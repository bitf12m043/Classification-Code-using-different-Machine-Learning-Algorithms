refinement first order induction and inversion resolution The FORTE system available via anonymous ftp This system contains the following items Quintus Prolog source code for Forte Various domain

image Refinement First Order Horn Clause Domain Theories Bradley Richards and Raymond Mooney Machine Learning Knowledge acquisition difficult and time consuming task and error prone any human activity The task automatically improving existing knowledge base using learning methods addressed new class systems performing theory refinement Until recently such systems were limited propositional theories This paper presents system FORTE First Order Revision Theories from Examples for refining first order Horn clause theories Moving first order representation opens many new problem areas such logic program debugging and qualitative modelling that are beyond the reach propositional systems FORTE uses hill climbing approach revise theories identifies possible errors the theory and calls library operators develop possible revisions The best revision implemented and the process repeats until further revisions are possible Operators are drawn from variety sources including propositional theory refinement first order induction and inverse resolution FORTE has been tested several domains including logic programming and qualitative modelling estlin utexas edu Date Tue Jan GMT Server NCSA

University California San Diego Jolla April Richard Belew Director are research group within the laboratory Our name CCSRG meant indicate that while our approach primarily computational are informed cognitive perspective both artificial and natural systems The focus our research group the characterization adaptive knowledge representations Issues representation have always played central role artificial intelligence well computer science and theories mind more generally would argue that most this work has implicitly explicitly assumed that the representational language wielded manually humans encoding explicit characterization what they believe true the world believe there are fundamental philosophical difficulties inherent any such approach aside Further there now exist modern machine learning techniques capable automatically developing elaborate representations the world date however the representations underlying this learning have not shown themselves able scale the semantically sophisticated task domains often associated with expert systems believe therefore appropriate reconsider basic notions what makes for good knowledge representation with constraints imposed the learning process considered sine qua non but conjuction with others expressive adequacy valid inference etc more typically considered have found productive pursue this general interest through several more specific research projects The first applies statistical techniques the problem free text information retrieval and linguistics more generally Many our projects use connectionist neural network representation documents and descriptive keywords that uses relevance feedback training signal reinforcement learning algorithm This construction allows system learn more effective indexing representation free text documents simple product the browsing behaviors its users Second have investigated wide range Genetic Algorithm GAs applications ranging from use artificial life models natural phenomena use artificial inductive method accomplish engineering goal like optimizing function believe our work these two areas allows stereoscopic view cognitive adaptation
