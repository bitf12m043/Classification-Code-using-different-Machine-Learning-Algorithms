and easier write than the program would written conventional programming language Our approach automatic programming based reuse generic algorithms through views generic algorithm performs some task such sorting linked list records based abstract descriptions the data which the program operates view describes how actual application data correspond the abstract data used the generic algorithm Given view generic algorithm can specialized compilation process produce version the algorithm that performs the algorithm directly the application data Graphical user interfaces make easy for the user create views the application data Given view any the library algorithms defined for that view can specialized work with the application data Specialized programs can produced multiple languages currently Lisp and from single copy the generic algorithms related system allows program specified graphically connecting diagrams that represent data physical laws and mathematical models line

PVaniM Visualization Animation Cluster EnvironmentsPVaniM Visualization Animation Cluster Environments PVaniM enhancement package for PVM that produces animations the execution PVM applications This document describes the subsystem that shows fine grained post mortem visualizations PVM applications Another subsystem PVaniM provides line low overhead minimal perturbation visualizations well PVaniM provides general purpose set views that work with all PVM applications and provides support for users build custom application specific animations The two main components PVaniM are tracing library and general purpose set animations that work with all PVM applications The PVaniM system provides its own robust tracing package for PVM This package not only drives the general purpose animations but also provides support for user trace events for use with custom application specific animations The PVaniM tracing package provides comprehensive timestamping techniques PVaniM not only performs clock synchronization and tachyon removal for its wall clock timestamp but also provides pure Lamport logical timestamp aid determining the concurrency and causality events that take place the application The second main component PVaniM general purpose library animations that work with all PVM applications This library was developed using the the POLKA Animation Designer Package and users may also use this package develop their own application specific animations Included below are snapshots from the PVaniM system All the PVaniM system available via anonymous FTP from ftp gatech edu under pub people stasko The support platform required for this machine running the Window System with Motif and compiler From the FTP site mentioned above you will need retrieve the files pvanimtrace tar and pvanimviz tar When users begin session with PVaniM they are presented with the PVaniM Menu Information Box and Polka Control Panel The PVaniM Information Box displays message communication information that can acquired clicking with the left mouse button objects some the views The Polka Control panel allows you change the speed the animation step through pause the animation The PVaniM Menu displays the general purpose views that are currently available The History view the first option available the PVaniM menu This scrolling view maintains history messages that have been sent received The axis this view labeled with Lamport clock values with time proceeding from bottom top The axis labeled with process identifiers Squares that are associated with message sends are filled with dark colors Lighter colors the same hue fill squares that are associated with the corresponding message receives Message size encoded filling squares with various amounts color This can deciphered using the History Legend view the second option listed the PVaniM Menu The third option available the PVaniM Menu the Causality View This view more complex version Feynman diagram and also known many Lamport timeline view this view the axis labeled with process identifiers and the axis labeled with Lamport clock values When message sent circle appears the appropriate logical time coordinate Varying circle radii are used denote message size and the color the circle the same that used the history view When message delivered arrow grows from the coordinate where the message was sent the correct Lamport delivery time the receiver timeline Simultaneously the circle representing the message moves along this path and then disappears Arrows may clicked the users with the left mouse button This will place the PVaniM Information Box pertinent data regarding the arrow which represents message communication such who sent the message who received its type and length This view similar the history view the information provides but very useful when trying distinguish communication patterns The fourth option available the PVaniM Menu the Message Passing view this view all the processes are laid out around the outside circle Messages are represented circles that smoothly move into the center the ring processes when sent near and end the vicinity the process that the message intended received any time messages may clicked the user with the left mouse button the PVaniM Information Box will appear data such who sent the message who received its type and length When process receives message the message moves from its position the center the ring the process The color the message the same color used the history view Contrail lines are provided that clear where the message came from The user may turn these lines off the view becomes too cluttered clicking the lines off button provided the inside the Message Passing View Further the radius the circles representing messages proportional message size Messages that are never delivered conspicuously remain the center Also the smooth animation message traffic helps portray actions such message broadcasts The fifth and final option available the Gant view This famous ParaGraph view where each process represented being computing sending message receiving message When message computing green line drawn when sending message yellow line drawn and when receiving red line drawn This simplistic version the ParaGraph view automatically provides time scaling such that the entire view fits the Gant window Back Software Visualization
