Query InterfaceThis section discusses the Visual Query interface DEVise IntroductionSessionHow represent data What visualize Where place graphics Command Summary Introduction database environment users ask their questions formulating queries over the underlying database The query output are the answers these questions The same questions can asked over and over different sets input data The same principle applies when graphics used represent data The difference that visual queries are formulated using graphical user interface against graphical data When formulating visual queries users start with set input data Graphical representations the input data are generated perhaps through extensive experimentations Users would navigate the data look for places interest Sometimes users might need additional help looking the original data represented the graphics The state the visualization environment forms visual query Just like database query the visual query can saved and applied over and over different sets input data visual query constructed manipulating the system components DEVise create component instances and interconnections These components are derived from model visualization The visual query interface manipulates these components allow the user specify what data visualized how data visualized and where place the graphics the display Session The state each visual query stored session Sessions are accessed from the Session menu with the following menu items Open restore previously saved visual query its original state Open template Apply previously saved visual query different set input data The user selects the new input data when session restored Close close current session Save save visual query file restored later Save save visual query under different name Save Template save visual query template Print print contents window save Postscript Quit quit DEVise How represent data The following commands are used specify what the user wants visualize Define MappingEdit MappingControlling Shape SizeDefine Mapping The Visualize Define command lets the user define new data streams TData and new visualizations the system The steps required create new visualization are summarized here Select data stream pulling down the Source selector select the Open command the bottom the selector define new data stream Click Auto run the automatic mapping utility Select the attributes visualization from the dialog box including the attribute one more attributes window name and layout and other options Click create the new visualization Edit Mapping The View Edit Mapping menu command allows the user experiment with the mapping GData the view dialog box appears allowing the user edit the mapping The dynamic nature editing the mapping valuable during data exploration because the effectiveness graphics may vary for different locations the data and for different zoom factors well The user can change all attributes the visualization including the color shape size pattern and orientation attributes Optional parameters such shape width and height can also defined Controlling Shape Pixel Size Sometimes the size shapes are small that they appear single pixels when drawn inside view often desirable accentuate these shapes enlarging their sizes bigger than single pixel Controlling the actual size pixel sized shapes done via keyboard commands directed view The key increases the size shapes while the key decreases the size the shapes What Visualize There are many ways specify what the user wants look Control Panel widgetsLayout versus Display modeAxesMouse and Keyboard EventsHistory WindowVisual LinkCursorSwitch TDataDuplicate WindowData QueryingControl Panel Widgets The widgets the control panel are mainly used for navigating the data The current view text widget displays the name the view that the user wishes navigate User commands initiated from the control panel widgets are applied the current view The user selects view the current view clicking inside its boundary with the left mouse button Interactions with widgets for navigation are translated into changing the visual filter the current view The widgets used for navigation are follows The arrow widgets are used scroll left right and down The widgets around the arrows are for zooming and out the directions The text widgets are used for editing the new and ranges Clicking the use button changes the view visual filter The undo edit button used undo the editing The back one button goes back one step the history changes the current view visual filter Clicking use moves back one step while clicking undo cancels the change Clicking the history widget brings the history window Layout Display Modes DEVise has two modes operation layout and display modes Users toggle between these two modes clicking the button the layout mode the user constructs mappings and views and decides where place views windows without having the graphics update the window The windows are eventually updated when the user switches into display mode Placing DEVise the layout mode time saver when large amounts data are involved The layout mode allows the user construct visual query without waiting for the graphics updated Otherwise adding view window may cause all other views already the same window together with linked views other windows updated simultaneously may take long time Axes The user can turn the display view axes off This accessed through the View Toggle Axis and the View Toggle Axis menus Mouse and Keyboard Events The user can use the following mouse commands Click anywhere view with the left button select the view the current view Click view with the middle button query the data that lies under the graphical object closest the mouse location Click left right down arrow the control panel scroll view Click zoom out buttons control panel zoom out view the direction Draw rectangle with the left mouse button pressed view zoom only the axis best for bar graphs Draw rectangle with the right mouse button pressed view zoom the and axes best for scatter plots The following keyboard commands are available Press number scroll view left right down Numbers correspond arrows numeric keypad with NumLock Press number zoom out view the direction Press number zoom out view the direction Press toggle symbol display off Press toggle connector display off History WindowThe history window accessed clicking the history button the control panel history changes the visual filter the current view are displayed Users can back places previously visited clicking history window entry and then clicking the use button the control panel Users can also mark unmark places interest clicking the mark column the history window The marked entries are preceded Because the history window has finite size old history entries are replaced new ones after the size the history window reaches maximum However marked entries are never replaced Visual Link Visual links are used link the axes multiple views that scrolling zooming one synchronously scrolls zooms all linked views The View Link menu brings dialog box that allows the user select link for the current view The dialog box also allows the user create new links and examine views that belong existing links The View Unlink menu allows the user dissociate view from link Cursor Click here for example Cursors are used display the boundaries one view relative another Clicking the destination view moves the cursor the clicked region the same time changing the visual filter the source view The cursor menu used access cursors Create creates cursor Delete deletes cursor Set source Set the source view for the cursor Set destination Set the destination view for the cursor Switch TData the user experiments with the mapping GData and navigates through scrolling zooming the user might come across location interest the data there are cases where the user wants see what the same location looks like for different set input data The accomplished through the View Switch TData menu command this time save eliminating the need use the mapping definition again when the only difference that different input being used Duplicate Window Consider window consisting set linked views the user navigates the views she might come across location interest One way save this location mark the history window However the user may also want compare two separate locations This most easily accomplished making copy the window that the two may placed side side for comparison This done choosing the Window Duplicate Window menu command After duplicating the window the user provided with two identical windows The user can use the first window reference point while using the second window for further navigation find other places interest Data Querying the user navigates the data there might places where information about the records used generate the graphics becomes important for understanding Pressing down the middle button may used query the data that underly the mouse result pop window appears giving the user information about the data records including attribute names and values Click for example the event that there too much information fit pop window the information displayed textually the user terminal Where Place Graphics Views and windows are the means through which the user decides place graphics First views can removed from windows reduce clutter moved other windows for side side comparison with other views These functions are accessed through the View Remove from Window and View Bring Back window menus When placed within the same window the positions views may also swapped using the View Swap Position menu Windows are responsible for arranging views inside their boundaries Different placement strategies may implemented Currently DEVise offers three window layouts tiled automatic vertical and horizontal addition DEVise relies the window manager particular implementations for moving window different locations the display for changing the size window for turning the window into icon Command SummaryMenus There are five groups menus Session Visualize View Cursor and Window now describe each one turn beginning with the Session menu Recall that the state each visual query session The session menu deals with saving and restoring visual queries Open restore previously saved visual query its original state Open template Apply previously saved visual query different set input data The user selects the new input data when session restored Close close current session Save save session under the default name Save save session under different name Save Template save visual query template Print print contents window save Postscript Quit quit DEVise The Visualize Menu used manage data streams and define visualizations See here for more information The View menu used operate views Most the menu items require that the current view specified clicking the view with the left mouse button The menu items are Edit Mapping edit mapping for current view Switch TData Apply the same mapping that creates the current view different input data Swap position Swap the positions the last two views selected current view Move Window Move current view another window Remove from Window Remove current view from its window Bring Back Window Bring back view that was removed earlier Link Select visual link for current view Unlink Remove current view from visual link Toggle Axis toggle axis display off Toggle Axis toggle axis display off Toggle Statistics toggle statistics display min max avg off Show KGraph control Kiviat graph displays Title set edit delete view titles The Cursor menu used operate cursors Create create cursor Delete delete cursor Set source make the current view the source the cursor Set destination make the current view the destination the cursor The Window menu operates windows Layout change the layout window Remove remove empty window Duplicate Make copy current window Help Open the help window display online documentation History Open the history window WidgetsThe control panel widgets are
