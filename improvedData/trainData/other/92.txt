Problsms Smoothing Methods for Convex Inequalities and Linear Complementarity Problsms Chunhui Chen and Olvi Mangasarian November smooth approximation bold alpha the plus function bold max obtained integrating the sigmoid function bold alpha commonly used neural networks means this approximation linear and convex inequalities are converted into smooth convex unconstrained minimization problems the solution which approximates the solution the original problem high degree accuracy for bold alpha sufficien tly large the special case when Slater constraint qualification satisfied exact solution can obtained for finite bold alpha Speed over MINOS was high times for linear inequalities size bold times and times for convex inequalities with vari ables Linear complementarity problems are converted into system smooth nonlinear equations and are solved quadratically convergent Newton method For monotone LCP with many variables the proposed approach was much times faster than Lemke
