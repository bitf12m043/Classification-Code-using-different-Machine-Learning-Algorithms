Based Image RetrievalGreg PassRamin ZabihAbstract Color histograms are widely used for content based image retrieval Their advantages are efficiency and insensitivity small changes camera viewpoint However histogram coarse characterization image and images with very different appearances can have similar histograms describe technique for comparing images called histogram refinement which imposes additional constraints histogram based matching Histogram refinement splits the pixels given bucket into several classes based upon some local property Within given bucket only pixels the same class are compared describe split histogram called color coherence vector CCV which partitions each histogram bucket based spatial coherence CCV can computed over images per second standard workstation database with images can queried using CCV under seconds demonstrate that histogram refinement can used distinguish images whose color histograms are indistinguishable paper entitled Histogram Refinement for Content Based Image Retrieval will appear the Workshop the Applications Computer Vision This paper available PDF format here Free PDF readers can obtained for many platforms from Adobe slightly older paper entitled Comparing Images Using Color Coherence Vectors will appear the ACM Conference Multimedia and available PDF format here rdz cornell edu gregpass cornell edu Monday July

Every Computer Science major required complete ENGL TECHNICAL WRITING Students who intend pursue graduate study computer science MAY complete total additional Advanced CSCI Electives Systems and Applied courses and advanced MATH courses level approved the academic advisor combined with maximum chosen from the courses below CSCI Cooperative Education CSCI Cooperative Education REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREE There are two components the degree computer science The first the core which all computer science majors must take The second elective section which each major selects four courses based personal interest and career goals from among advanced topics computer science This allows students tailor their course work their own needs while ensuring that every student receives the same fundamental background certain important areas computer science Before being admitted the next computer science mathematics course sequence grade better must earned every prerequisite course Graph
