Program Due Friday November Objective Give the student practice with classes and emumerations Update November You are required use project and separate compilation for this project See the page Using Projects for the details Program Description The phone service DOCTORS has decided expand their business addition their usual service finding doctors they will now find people dentists and hair dressers well and even make the appointments for them They need able save all this information though and everyone sick and tired writing stuff down paper and killing trees Obviously the information needs stored computer Believe not this where you come You need write program that will fill three appointments the users request doctor dentist hair For each appointment should first ask the user they want make that particular appointment they you should then ask for the relevent time information month day hour minute After all appointments have been made you should print out the user appointments with the time either military standard format you should ask which they want for each typical run the program would look something like this you want make doctor appointment Enter the month Enter the day the month Enter the hour Enter the minute you want make dental appointment you want make hair appointment Enter the month Enter the day the month Enter the hour Enter the minute Doctor Appointment Military Standard time The appointment Monday January Hair Appointment Military Standard time The appointment Wednesday March There are lots variables needed store the information for appointment They are follows the month the month the year JAN FEB MAR DEC must enumerated type the day month the day the month make your life easier all months the year will have days this should integer with legal values the day week the day the week MON TUE SUN must enumerated type the hour day the hour the day appointments are stored military time this will integer between and where the hour between midnight and the minute hour the minute the hour this integer between and THIS CAN NOT filled whether not the data for this appointment has been set must enumerated boolean type that enumerated types with tags true and false There are six variables all Since are storing three different appointments this would mean variable declarations Also would nice could have our own set member functions just for appointments and able protect the appointment data from other parts the program The sane solution these potential problems define and implement Appointment class will then not only get away with only three declarations appointment objects but will have nicely modularized program stated above you should define Appointment class must contain the six variables for storing the appointment information should also contain the following method functions Appointment public this the constructor should initialize filled false indicate that the appointment has not been set yet get day private this function will set the day week variable based upon the current month and day month you can assume that January Monday and that all months have exactly days since are dealing with classes this should not need have any formal parameters and should not need return anything read app public this function will fill all the necessary appointment information should first prompt for and read from cin the month day month hour and minute and make sure that they all have legitimate values the hour should read military format the month should read int and then type cast the month enumerated type should then set the day week calling get day thus read app should not prompt the user for the day the week should then set filled indicate that the appointment has been set filled public should return true the current object appointment has been set and false otherwise this function necessary because the filled variable private and can not accessed the caller print mil time private this function will print the time military hour format this should not require any parameters and does not need return anything print stan time private this function will print the time standard hour format this should not require any parameters and does not need return anything write app public this function will write out cout the appointment information the information has been filled not message should displayed which says that information has been entered yet otherwise should ask the user wants the time printed military standard format and appropriate error checking you will probably want function this should then print out the day week the month the day monththe entire name the month should written not just the number should then print the time the format the user requests calling one the two private time print functions Main should not able harm any the class data all variables int the class must made private The constructor function Appointment must made public this hard and fast rule constructors Also the functions read app write app and filled are all called main and should made public other functions are needed outside the class and the remaining functions must therefore remain private The main part should relatively simple The first thing you need declare three objects type appointment For each appointment you should prompt the user wants fill that particular appointment doctor call read app fill the necessary information After this done for all three appointments you should print out each appointment that set this should checked calling filled manner similar the example What Turn usual only want electronic submission printed copy your source code and more test runs which thoroughly tests your program features and error checking Suggestions Final Notes Notice that both main and within one the class functions have the need read character for yes type question and error checking This something that should done within function Written Dave Zimmermann dzimm
