that are discussed lecture Print out copies these files and bring them lecture suggest that you put examples with multiple files their own directory keep them separated Copies the samples may gotten one several ways The files are linked this samples page and may retrieve using the File Save the File Save command your web browser Mosaic Netscape Just the page sample code and choose one the save commands for your browser This probably the easiest way get copies when working from your home computer You must save the files using the names given the samples page for them compile You can also directly copy files your computer science account using the UNIX command there single file for the sample code enter the following command the UNIX prompt and replace the filename with the name the file given the list above public html samples filename there are several files for the code sample they will placed their own directory this case you would enter the following command the UNIX prompt and replace the directory with the name the directory shown parentheses the list above public html samples directory you you are having problems make certain that you have not mistakenly typed one where you should have typed They look very similar The commands shown above not have any ones them Copyright copy James Skrentny skrentny wisc edu
