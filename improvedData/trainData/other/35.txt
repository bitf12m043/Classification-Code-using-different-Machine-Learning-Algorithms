Spring Symposium Planning Uncertain Unpredictable Changing Environments pages Stanford March Short Description Artificial Intelligence techniques become mature there has been growing interest applying these techniques controlling complex real world systems which involve hard deadlines such systems the controller required respond certain inputs within rigid deadlines the system may fail catastrophically For example the Mars Rover project requires partially fully autonomous vehicle that can perform unsupervised navigation hazardous conditions where errors could mean the loss multi million dollar research and development efforts Controlling the Rover includes real time tasks such obstacle avoidance and emergency reactions unexpected terrain hazards the system ever fails meet the deadlines associated with these control tasks may suffer damage tantamount mission failure Since the number possible domain situations too large fully enumerated and the consequences failure are severe testing alone insufficient guarantee the required real time performance These control problems require systems which can proven meet the hard deadlines which the environment imposes Hard wired control schemes using fixed algorithms are amenable such performance analysis but cannot address high level problems such reasoning about goals resource restrictions and recovery from unexpected failures Unfortunately many the techniques and heuristics developed solve these high level problems are not suited analyses that would provide guaranteed response times For example systems that learn are able form new chains inferences resulting changing performance characteristics that may defy worst case bounding Even when techniques can shown have predictable response times the variance these response times typically large that providing timeliness guarantees based the worst case performance would result severe underutilization the computational resources during normal operations Thus perceive apparent conflict between the nature and the needs real world real time control systems While methods are characterized unpredictable high variance performance real time control systems require constant predictable performance Most research real time RTAI focuses either restricted techniques that have predictable performance characteristics reactive systems that retain little the power traditional The Lab and the Real Time Computing Lab are cooperating new branch RTAI research here the University Michigan combine unrestricted techniques with the ability make hard performance guarantees are investigating Cooperative Intelligent Real Time Control Architecture CIRCA this architecture subsystem reasons about task level problems that require its powerful but unpredictable reasoning methods while separate real time subsystem uses its predictable performance characteristics deal with control level problems that require guaranteed response times The key difficulty with this approach allowing the subsystems interact without compromising their respective performance goals have developed scheduling module and structured interface that allow the unconstrained subsystem asynchronously direct the real time subsystem without violating any response time guarantees Realistic intelligent control systems must recognize their resource limitations and make tradeoffs the quality their control outputs responses Many systems recognize resource limitations and trade off the precision confidence timeliness their responses CIRCA extends this mechanism allowing the system explicitly trade off the completeness its responses CIRCA subsystem and scheduler cooperatively reason about the real time subsystem execution resources and choose subset responses that the real time subsystem will guarantee manipulating the responses that the real time subsystem guaranteeing the subsystem attempts ensure that the real time subsystem will meet hard deadlines and also achieve the overall system goals CIRCA also provides mechanisms utilize the time which becomes available when guaranteed mechanisms use less than their worst case scheduled time allowance achieve flexible control CIRCA requires that the methods reason about the expected real time demands the environment and build control plans guarantee meeting those demands CIRCA does this using formal graph based model agent environment interactions exploring space states that the system could due its own actions due external events and due the passage time constructing control plans CIRCA determines what actions must guarantee take and how often will able take them ensure that the system does not enter state where could transition into failure due the passage time Currently CIRCA able develop such control plans when possible and when not possible CIRCA provides well defined transformations the graph model based predominantly eliminating extending various types transitions that allow systematically relax requirements until can guarantee the performance control plan Our ongoing work investigating how choose from among candidate transformations yield the best possible control plan are also investigating improved scheduling techniques for efficiently generating guaranteed control plans using internal state the real time subsystem reduce costly sensory actions and strategies for transitioning among control plans Application domains for CIRCA include manufacturing process control and mobile robotics Last Updated Server Netscape Communications Date Wednesday Dec GMT Last modified Wednesday Oct GMT
