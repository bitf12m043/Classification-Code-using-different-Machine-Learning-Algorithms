type text plain Last modified Tue Feb GMT Content length Notes from Section meeting discussing the assembler Two Pass Assembly You will need write two pass assembler The first pass will note the line numbers for each label The second pass will generate code and when branch call statements are encountered will use the offset from the the current line the label noted pass you will need two loops that pass over the code One way loop over the code would line start for next line END FILE format next line help the label calculation have provided two routines associate and lookup void associate char int associates string with given integer int lookup char returns string not found associate takes string and integer line number and stores them lookup takes string and returns the associated integer would make sense use associate the first pass and lookup the second pass Note that for this code foo add sub foo when you generate code the number you put into the branch target field for the instruction would the number That you encode the distance INSTRUCTIONS between the branch and its target Code Generation The front end converts all the text the source file into binary particular numbers will supplied you binary You can tell that the fact that they are declared int int binary represented integer two complement You will need take binary ints and place them into the bitfields
