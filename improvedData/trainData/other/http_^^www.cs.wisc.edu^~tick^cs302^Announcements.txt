Date Wed Dec GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Wed Dec GMT Content length Section Announcements Announcements Make sure check these announcements and reminders regular basis keep date with the latest news and changes Quiz solutions Note for Friday Quiz solutions are Also bring questions the exam for Friday cumulative but focused more towards the half the course from arrays onward Lecture notes Lecture notes everything including complex numbers are also has some additional info double precision numbers that will talked about Monday Quiz one test case removed for program rest schedule Quiz Wed the One question graphs one question complex numbers and one either integration least sqaures fit depending how much least squares get Monday For program there are now test cases instead The first one the one with removed because doesn make sense put golfer past the hole for next week Monday least squares Wed the quiz shorter than last time then the rest Wed and all Fri will review bring questions Quiz solutions another way program Quiz solutions are the Web Page for program the book suggests using tincr rather than xincr This due the fact that parametric functions are not always functions terms and For example cos sin generates unit circle around the origin circle not function terms and gives two values and but function from each pair our circle corresponds exactly one For this reason you can really work with xincr you have idea how many values you need test for but you can work with tincr However when you hit golf ball its trajectory parabola which know function coordinates Our equations were vtcos theta and vtsin theta can write terms solving the equation for and then plugging that into the equation get equation and can use xincr normally even though this parametric equation Prog fully test cases included quiz note Week notes The test cases for programs and are fully all test cases are now included the gradesheets Also note for quiz most the material everything except the fixed point method form sec the book looking that over will help ALso Week notes root finding methods are Prog Week notes Final Quizzes Program problem the text Gradesheets can found with Program link the main web page not yet Program will today Both are due the last day class Program will count double grade Week notes will today well There will more quizzes Wed the and Wed the More detail will given Monday The Final will Tues the the same room class meets Prog note Prog Note Week Stack and Queue notes program told the grader concentrate mainly the pig latin part the assignment you read the lines from the keyboard and print screen instead disk long compiles and works correctly you won lose more than points program make sure maintain integer variable keep track priority queue size heapify and the other operations only operate the sections the array that are currently use Also remember never delete from the NAME and AGE arrays The age may deleted from one the data structures but not from all Week notes are help you with stacks and queues Quiz Solutions are available the Web Page Also got days mixed class Program due week from FRIDAY not week from Wed PROG DAT Program available room assigned for EXAM Yes long last PROG DAT now PUBLIC TICK anyone know where the paragraph comes from Program due week from Wednesday Yes that only week but short assignment The next one will short well covering the material for Program after quiz Wednesday Lastly room where having the exam Tuesday the Extension Program Quiz next Wed exam the Week notes Program now due Wed the Also Wed have quiz sorting searching and recursion explain what covered Monday Also the exam Tuesday the haven been given room assignment yet The Week notes Heaps available still editing the notes recursion Notes arrays Web Program Quiz Friday The Web Pages for the notes are updated Program indeed Pig Latin creator due Friday There some tricks involved loading and saving disk not easy sounds Also there will quiz Friday arrays One question arrays one multidim arrays will involve declaring arrays passing them out functions They total questions one which will writing small amount code VERSION PROGRAM NOW LAB COMPUTERS solution can found public tick prog for you wish copy your working directory get into your working directory and type COPY PUBLIC TICK PROG FOR filename where filename stands for whatever you want rename prog for presumably you already have your own version program called prog for you want rename version because always good keep your copy around case you decide later that you don want use version Most straight forward except for two things For NTWALL you can increment Marvin and coordinates and then check see wall because and you return FALSE Marvin now sitting the wall you already moved him However you copy and into two temporary variables you can move those temporaries then test those instead Only the temporaries will moved not the actual and coordinates actually used MKMOVE increment the temporary variables rather than having write out that part statement both MKMOVE and NTWALL The subroutine for printing the grid had quite lot very similar statements well made auxiliary subroutine SETGRD take care Look GRID before you look SETGRD The latter will easier follow you look GRID first Program reduced due date moved Week notes Web version Program coming soon Since many you have been finishing program until now the due date for program needed extended Monday Also program has been shortened Now there creating new board from within your program and writing disk and the board stays fixed size You will still read the board from disk from file called BOARD DAT Also you still adding the interior walls and the dimensional array for the board Once everyone program turned putting version program the Web You may add this version for program you wish Also Week lecture notes are the Web Exam Just repeat the first exam Tuesday the Chapters from Program Week notes Web Also remember Program due date extended this Monday the ReminderQuiz Wednesday One question writing and WHILE loops one question fixing logical errors and statements qeustion subroutine arguments Program Lecture Notes for Week Both are the Web The due date for Program Wed October Program Lectures Notes for Week and Week Quiz Solutions All the above are now the Web Program was too complex presented class been scaled down may implement some the other features later assignments The due date Mon September New things Web Program and Notes for Week are both the Web Consolidated Description What DOS Fortran now consolidated everything how log use fortran DOS etc onto one Web Page here the form set steps you can follow plus descriptions each step The actual steps are bold Make sure read the descriptions they will tell you when use those steps and when skip them Consultants good Fortran Click here for the schedule the consultants and list which are proficient Fortran Slight Alteration Program Program has been altered slightly Fri The current version the Program home page The Class location being movedStarting Monday class will Computer Science and Statistics Program available While not going graded Program will get you used working Microsoft Fortran well the few basic DOS commands that you need the future Also will give you sense how the directories are arranged for class will the lab both Friday and Monday Read our home page thoroughly Please make sure that you have read everything the class home page thoroughly contains everything you need know about this course gradesheets late policy academic misconduct etc This constitutes class hanout you are required familiar with everything Class Mailing List Please send piece mail from the same account you normally read your mail from your name students wisc edu otherwise somehow let know your mail address that can add you the class mailing list Click here send mail RemindersLogging Out Remember exit Windows logout before you leave the lab Otherwise the next person has complete access your account change your password delete your files etc Also remember remove your floppy disk before you case you forget make sure you have your name class and section number written all your disks that they can returned you Sending and Reading mail The default when you first run the mail program use your Computer Science mail account your name wisc edu However you probably want use your WiscWorld account most the time your name students wisc edu change this the Special menu the mail program select the Configuration menu option and change the account name your name students wisc edu When you send mail make sure you send from the account you will read your mail from because will reply the same account that you mailed from Forwarding mail forward all the mail sent your Computer Science account your WiscWorld account you need talk the lab administrator the floor
