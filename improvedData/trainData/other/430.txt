Objectives are engaged ambitious effort derive incremental programs automatically semi automatically from non incremental programs written standard programming languages This approach contrasts with our earlier approaches that aimed incrementally evaluate non incremental programs essence every program computes fixed point iteration expressed recursive functions loops This why loop optimizations are important loop body can regarded program parameterized induction variable that incremented each iteration change operation Efficient iterative computation relies effective use state computing the result each iteration using stored results previous iterations This why strength reduction and related techniques are crucial for performance Given program and input change operation program that computes efficiently using the result the previous computation called incremental version under Sometimes information other than the result needs maintained and used for efficient incremental computation call function that computes such information extended version Thus the goal computing loops efficiently corresponds constructing extended version program and deriving incremental version the extended version under input change operation general incremental computation aims solve problem sequence inputs that differ only slightly from one another making use the previously computed output computing new output instead computing the new output from scratch Incremental computation fundamental issue relevant throughout computer software optimizing compilers transformational program development and interactive systems Results Thus far have partitioned the problem deriving incremental programs into three subproblems Exploiting the result the return value Caching maintaining and exploiting intermediate results the computation Discovering computing maintaining and exploiting auxiliary information about information not computed summarize here the essence our methods Systematic Derivation Incremental Programs gave systematic transformational approach for deriving incremental version program under input change The basic idea identify the computation those subcomputations that are also performed the computation and whose values can retrieved from the cached result The computation symbolically transformed avoid performing these subcomputations replacing them with corresponding retrievals This efficient way computing captured the definition Caching Intermediate Results for Program Improvement gave method called cache and prune for statically transforming programs cache all intermediate results useful for incremental computation The basic idea extend the program program bar that returns all intermediate results incrementalize the program bar under obtain incremental version bar bar using our method for and III analyze the dependencies bar then prune the extended program bar program hat that returns only the useful intermediate results and prune the program bar obtain program hat that incrementally maintains only the useful intermediate results Discovering Auxiliary Information for Incremental Computation proposed novel approach for finding auxiliary information Auxiliary information definition useful information about that not computed Where then can one find The key insight our proposal Consider candidate auxiliary information for all intermediate computations incremental version that depend only such incremental version can obtained using some techniques developed for solving and use techniques developed for solving and instead just that the candidate auxiliary information includes auxiliary information useful for efficiently maintaining the intermediate results How can one discover which pieces candidate auxiliary information are useful and how they can used proposed Extend with all candidate auxiliary information then apply some techniques used our methods for and obtain extended version and incremental extended version that together compute exploit and maintain only useful intermediate results and useful auxiliary information Thus the one hand one can regard the method for extension methods for and the other hand one can regard methods for and suitably revised for their different applications here aids for solving The modular components complement one another form comprehensive principled approach for incremental computation and therefore also for efficient iterative computation generally Although the entire approach seems complex each module step simple CACHET Interactive Incremental

online materials that will point you later the semester library materials You should make your decision based both your interests and the areas that you are weak For old fashioned access info the Engineering library may better source than PCL The Engineering Library periodicals section filled with interesting materials related all aspects the communications field Drop and browse The book that you will probably refer most this semester book Java recommend that you buy book The one that specified the bookstore Core Java Cornell and Horstmann SunSoft Press Prentice Hall title ROM included For books Client Server socket prog suggest one these two Internetworking with TCP Volume III Client Server Programming and Applications BSD Socket Version Doug Comer and David Stevens Prentice Hall This book focuses the different algorithms for designing client and server more big picture book than the one below but also includes sample code and reference info make immediately usable asked the bookstores get few copies this one Unix Network Programming Richard Stevens Prentice Hall While this book bit older THE book referenced implementers For this course you would refer Chapter IPv new book HOT off the press and received copy yesterday will let you know Lecture required IPv The New Internet Protocol Huitema Prentice Hall Background Reading TCP protocols Since will focused protocol issues found the Internet you will need start getting speed the basic concepts found the Internet Protocols particularly UDP TCP some routing update protocols DNS and some the application protocols smtp snmp telnet ftp tftp nntp http you did not get this from then you may want reference book will need read online info Two reference books are Comer Internetworking with TCP Principles Protocols and Architecture Volume Prentice Hall This more date than Steven book Protocols are described high level minimal examples occasionally need refer specific RFCs Stevens TCP Illustrated The Protocols
