Table ContentsIntroductionData TransformationVisualization ProceduresResultsConclusionFigures and MPEG sAcknowledgeReferences Introduction Geographic Information System GIS powerful tool used many fields especially the environmental monitoring and analysis However most GIS software packages are focus the analysis they often have limited presentation ability The combination GIS and scientific visualization enables the researchers the field GIS present the processes and results their work the audience manner more realistic sense This project visualized the processes and results GIS analysis for simulating the distribution nitric pollutants watershed accordance with the geographic topological and environmental conditions The analysis was done team coordinated Prof Stephen DeGloria the Center for the Environment Cornell using various GIS software packages and independently developed programs The goal this project generat flexible prototype visualization modules for typical GIS work using IBM Data Explorer Data Transformation Like most visualization work the first task this project acquire all necessary data The data used the analysis include the digital elevation models DEM hydrology models runoff water content soil data landuse types etc The hydrology data were collected two year series The results the analysis consist the distribution three nitrogen compounds for the study time series Each nitric pollutant are simulated four different layers the same region study area Since the data came from different sources and the simulation was done the analysis team using different packages and self developed programs the data formats are diverse addition considering the huge data volume and the limitation data storage most machines the data are stored Cornell Theory Center UniTree mass storage set and then retrived via AFS whenever needed After the data were fetched they were converted into consistent format using several UNIX shell scripts and programs One the purposes the data conversion speed the data extraction from the two year master hydrology nitrogen data otherwise will time consuming deal with different formats different data sets Visualization Procedures Some the shell scripts and programs used data conversion were extended generate the input file for various data set for example DEM for importing the DEM into the These scripts and programs are flexible form the can retrive various data different time period without changing anything except the right parameters call the programs and scripts properly After importing the data needs conduct coordinate transformation because has right hand coordinate system and most GIS data are left hand coordinat systems some them are even their own particular coordinate systems addition since the data came from different sources they may collected different time and different cell resolutions two more data sets are involved one application the data have interpolated and manually adjusted correct the coordinate displacements Assume the data are all correctly correspondent positions the next step construct the prototype two dimensional and three dimensional display Several color look tables have been generated and the format compatible these LUT are for soil and landuse displays Hydrology and nitrogen data are colored the colormap module However because most the distributions the nitrigen and hydrology data are not linear special Log scale scheme was adopted log transform the data interactively The log algorithm described below adopting this algorithm the values data will scaled values between NewMin specified Unfortunately the results this log algorithm varies with user sepecified NewMin and NewMax therefore different data sets need different parameters accomplish reasonable redistribution the data values The last part the visualization procedures provide adjustible animation options for different scenarios this project both two dimensional and three dimensional animations are provided order provide ultimate flexibility parameters are built the control panels for users specify the values interactively These parameters include file data selectors data layer selectors coordinate correction parameters log algorithm parameters display options viewing control etc Results addition the shell scripts and programs code mentioned above several nets have been accomplished for this project They provide visualization and animation functions for different demands These nets are also equiped with control panel type user interfaces for inputing and interactively adjusting the data and displays well generating images and animations according different scenarios The final results are actually dependent the scenarios desired the visualization outputs can also redirected into other packages and instruments for post processing for example generating broadcast quality video tape have include several images and animations generated from the nets the Conclusion Scientific visualization techniques strengthen the presentation power GIS providing the thorough viewing options multi dimensional space extends the GIS into another world Moreover the interactive adjusting and psudo real time display changes for examining the data also improve the accuracy GIS analysis The nets generated this project provide the analysis team alternative review their work different perspectives and present the processes and results more effective and understandable way Since those nets were built provide prototype for visualizing the GIS work they can used generate various displays and animations accordance with different purposes They can also easily modified for similar GIS analysis projects adopt The tentative future work this project might incorporate the visualization algorithms with the internet utilities for example build the VRML applications the Web pages Pictures and MPEG perspective view colored DEM Last updated NOv The watershed
