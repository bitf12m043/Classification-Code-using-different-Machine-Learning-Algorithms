The graduate bulletin contains all the information about course requirements Other related administrative information available too Breadth courses and Depth coursesSend your course comments questions Masters Students Thesis Option Not Masters students have the option taking fewer courses and doing thesis taking more courses and not doing thesis The non thesis option usually faster You can Masters degree months under this option The thesis option usually takes years Students who like research are thinking doing PhD who just want stay school little longer should consider the thesis option you just want get degree and get job you probably want the non thesis option Send your comments questions Approaching the PhD The decision PhD major decision will have substantial affect your life and career you start the PhD take advantage the hindsight provided other graduate students The collected wisdom generations grad students and advisors can found below The famous How Research the MIT Lab document good place start And the legendary How good Grad Student Advisor always useful huge collection advice for graduate students available CMU Here Postscript version the advice guide from Rutgers University General adviceGet started research early Talk several professors during your first semester Don wait until get settled The social relationship with your advisor crucial you don feel that your advisor somewhat friend supporter then the path PhD will rough Push yourself Your advisor has need push you out You are doing valuable research for her him you want graduate you will need put yourself position Advice specific our departmentComment from Micheal Hewett Send your comments questions Advice for women Women feeling overwhelmed the male dominated sciences may interested group called Women Computer Science Ellen Spertus MIT has collected lot information gender related issues Systers another national organization catering women Computer Science There are also local chapters systers Send mail utcs systers request and austin systers request get the local mailing lists Funding Most PhD students the department will for least one two semesters during their graduate career positions are usually available any PhD student there particular class you would like for talk the professor who teaches that class the professor requests you for particular class you are likely get that class duties can range from simply grading homework most graduate breadth courses teaching two classes This reporter found that teaching two courses required less time than grading graduate level course but your experience may vary The hope course that your advisor will get big research grant that will support you for your graduate career This happens most but not all the time You can help yourself investigating research funding opportunities and learning how write grant proposals Also apply for fellowships since they pay tuition while and positions not include tuition waivers UCSB

Student comments the proposal process Still waiting for comments Send your comments the proposal The DissertationAdministrative Requirements come FormatThe Computation Center has LaTeX and Word

bit mux These next components were created Homework bit CLA adder bit mux Problem schematic Memory unit plus its component part schematics memory control unit RAM module Problem Implementing MYCALC requires you use the ALU and memory module that you created the previous two design questions plus you must make program counter which can count Beyond this the rest the design finite state machine which must able cycle through the instructions the memory which you pre loaded into the RAM and execute them The control for MYCALC must able synchronize the actions the memory and the program counter The ALU purely combinational deosn really require synchronization However would nice feature the output MYCALC the output the ALU was tristated off the value was invalid before the first instruction executed prove that MYCALC works correctly must simulated with wide range input sequences that exercises all MYCALC capabilities The simulation results must illustrate that every part works hiding something that doesn work will not suffice Course Account ece
