geometrically transforming object size orientation and location then combining objects make complex scene There are several example programs given below show you how combine objects and animate them Based these examples you will asked construct short animation Procedure First you may want download several example files this click each the filenames shown below When the text window opens use the save option put the file your own directory Name each file with the same name shown below you decide not look all them you may load them pairs net and cfg The program polyhedra unit net reads data file polyhedra unit You will need change the path name the Import module the program reflect the directory which you copy polyhedra unit The programs windmill net and cubeflake net also require the data file polyhedra unit transform net transform cfg windmill net windmill cfg cubeflake net cubeflake cfg rose net rose cfg polyhedra unit net polyhedra unit cfg polyhedra unit The first program example which shows how scale rotate and translate object Open the program transform net and control panel and execute while changing the rotation translation and scaling the simple object see Image The program also allows you select whether the translate control transforms the object before the scaling and rotation after them Note that you rotate the object that positive angle rotation corresponds counterclockwise rotation you are looking down the positive axis rotation toward The object defined have the base the arrows that the scale operation magnifies the objects but does not move the base Likewise the rotate operation which rotates around the origin leaves the base the origin translation performed last Investigate the effects changing the order the rotate translate and scaling operations using the operation order control and modifying the program module order Image The second program windmill net example hierarchically modelled animated object see Image The object windmill constructed from propellor and tower The propellor turn make two blades hub and shaft Open the sequencer and run the program The QuadricSurface module gererates spheres cylinders and other shapes The shape set integer The shape list may found double clicking the QuadricSurface module then clicking the Description button The import module reads the vertex list cube from polyhedra unit Edit the file see what else there Rotation the whole tower controlled compute module with conditional delay rotation Image The third example program cubeflake net combines polyhedra make interesting object see Image Open the control panel and run the program using the sequencer Note how multiple copies objects are positioned Image Other Lab demonstration nets polyhedra unit net see Image rose net see Image Image Image Assignment Using the three example programs background construct one the objects described below Use the various modules the macros category which produce shapes such NewQuadricSurface Also use the shapes defined the polyhedra unit file Animate the resulting objects specified The animation should frames length small Image window size perhaps will speed execution Construct one helicopter with fuselage tail skids main rotor and tail rotor The tail rotor should rotate twice fast the main rotor The helicopter should sit the ground until the blades are spinning then fly straight propellor airplane which the propellors rotate the same rate The plane should have wings tail engines and cockpit canopy The plane should sit the ground until the blades are spinning then roll forward and flowering plant with stem leaves and flower The plant should grow and bloom The flower should constructed from several petals There must least two leaves the plant robot with head body arm and least two wheels The robot must roll forward stop grasp object and move The head must have eyes cameras which move together bird landing tree The bird must have wings head eyes beak and feet The wings must flap and the feet must move the bird lands Some examples from Some examples from prepared demo your animation during section for maximum minutes You will graded the correctness the animation and the readability the program You may want MPEG compress your animation for rapid playback you wish submit the course web pages You must document your code Layout small groups modules which fit one screen and connect them other groups with transmitters You should use transmitters receivers macros and comments the Notation field each module that you and the grader can understand the program Control panels any should well organized labeled and with the appropriate numeric ranges The Lab grading guide will filled out consultant during section evaluate your work Back Main Page Lab

Algorithms for Switch Module Routing Problem Proceedings the Euro DAC September consider switch module routing problem for symmetric array FPGAs The work motivated two applications The first that efficiently evaluating switch module designs The second that evaluating the routability global routing paths for placement this architecture Only approximate algorithm was previously known for this problem this paper present optimal algorithm for the problem based integer linear programming Experimental results consistently show that our algorithm very efficient for practical sized switch modules further improve this technique doing some pre processing the given switch module also identify interesting special cases the problem which can solved optimally polynomial time Contact thakur utexas edu Yao Wen Chang Shashidhar Thakur Kai Zhu Wong New Global Routing Algorithm for FPGAs Proceedings the IEEE International Conference Computer Aided Design November traditional ASIC technologies FPGA routing usually consists two steps global routing and detailed routing Unlike existing FPGA detailed routers which can take full advantage the special structures the programmable routing resources FPGA global routing algorithms still greatly resemble their counterparts the traditional ASIC technologies particular the routing congestion information switch block essentially still measured the numbers available rows and columns the switch block Since the internal architecture switch block decides what can route through the block the traditional measure routing capacity longer accurate this paper present accurate measure switch block routing capacity Our new measure considers the exact positions the switches inside switch block Experiments with global router based these ideas show average improvement the channel width required route some benchmark circuits using popular switch block compared with algorithm based the traditional methods for congestion control
