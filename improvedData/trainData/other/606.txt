about much fun had grading them Next prelim good luck the home stretch Course Description credit course that introduces fundamental computer programming and problem solving concepts Programming projects are written the programming language Some assignments will also use Matlab assumes prior knowledge computing and has prerequisite computer science courses However majority the students recent years have had some programming experience prior taking The course may taken for letter grade your college program advisor allows UGeneral InformationCS Instructors Tim Teitelbaum Upson Mike Godrey

Open FTutoring All tutoring will out Upson Call visit the Undergraduate Office sign for tutoring appointments you are having trouble with the course You must sign least hours advance you need cancel appointment you must call the Undergraduate Office advance you miss two tutoring appointments without calling cancel you will not given further appointments Lectures Lectures for and meet the same times The first five lectures August through September for both and will meet Olin and Beginning Tuesday September lectures for and will meet separately Lecture section numbers times and rooms are follows LecturesCS Olin Olin Sections Sections DayTimeRoom Tue Phillips Tue Phillips Tue Morill Tue Uris Wed Phillips Wed Phillips Wed Phillips Wed Hollister Section meeting Tuesday has been canceled you are registered for that section you should attend section instead Sections are required part the course used clarify topics covered lecture discuss programming problems and work additional problems and exercises Graded programs and exams are returned sections and sample solutions and practice exams are handed out there All sections for each week will cover the same topics However there will some variations problems and exercises depending the instructor and the interests the students each section Computing Facilities Programming assignments will use Metrowerks CodeWarrior programming environment Macintosh computers The computer room the basement Carpenter Hall the primary lab for students have priority this lab and this where you will find consultants extra copies handouts unclaimed work and posted announcements and grades There are around Macintosh IIci computers the Carpenter lab each with main memory and hard disk running Apple System The Carpenter lab open when the Engineering library Normal hours are Mon Thurs Fri Sat Sun Hours will restricted during vacations and university holidays Although Carpenter the primary lab for CodeWarrior available all CIT public Macintoshes that have enough disk space and RAM support During peak periods you may want use machine another location avoid long lines Carpenter food drink allowed the computer labs Please keep the area clean and recycle Consultants duty the Carpenter Hall basement daily and most evenings starting Aug The exact schedule will announced class and posted Carpenter Consultants will Help you find program errors Consultants will not fix your programs for you they will suggest how you can find errors and fix them yourself Receive assignments Return prelims and programs that were not picked sections Bring you card with you when you pick exam Receive regrade requests Provide tutoring but only during slack periods Texts and Other Materials Text The Art and Science Eric Roberts recommended Getting Started with Matlab Rudra Pratap optional The readings listed the syllabi are suggested readings help you follow the lectures and section material Exams are not based the reading list they are based material covered lectures sections and assignments You are not responsible for material the book that not covered class Handouts Distributed class limited extra copies will available Carpenter Communications Announcements are posted the bulletin board your right you enter the Carpenter lab and are the newsgroups cornell class aSoftware Cornell Information Technologies CIT provides Metrowerks CodeWarrior and Matlab all its public Macintosh computers access Matlab you will given user name and password all students use the same user name and password not give this password others not forget the password The course staff has been instructed not give the password anyone you forget you will have see your instructor Disks You will need few inch floppy disks for your programming assignments student files may left CIT public machines they are cleanedout every day You must store your files your own floppy disks You also should keep back copies all your work separate disks This site under construction Sorry for any inconviences Last Updated Sunday October you have any comments suggestions please email them dwu cornell edu Date Tue Jan GMT Server Apache Content type text html

PublicationsComputational CombustionComputational Combustion PublicationsDetailed multi dimensional numerical simulations provide ideal vehicle study fundamental properties hydrocarbon flames The physical processes hydrocarbon flames are highly complex and interact strongly non linear fashion Numerical experimentation excellent way isolate physical processes study their interactions predict important properties such flammability limits The study flammability limits great practical importance fire safety Near the flammability limit several physical processes especially chemistry become very important and the interaction among them becomes crucial determining the flammability limit Only highly detailed models which include detailed chemistry and diffusive processes can obtain the correct flammability limits The extinction hydrocarbon flames multidimensional transient process date sufficiently detailed calculations for hydrocarbon flames has only been carried out for steady state flames Some preliminary calculations transient methane flames with moderately detailed flames have been carried out the Naval Research Laboratory These calculations clearly show the need for including detailed chemistry hydrocarbon flame modeling The reaction scheme used these calculations used species and reactions complete reaction mechanism for methane would involve species and reactions For higher hydrocarbons which are more interest the Navy the number species and reactions far greater These calculations are currently beyond the capabilities current supercomputers Parallel computers are only means currently available perform these calculations Thus imperative that the current detailed flame code ported parallel machine The existing sequential code has been extensively tested and verified ensure reliability the code should ported with only minimum modification The PARTI software will enable port the code wide variety parallel computes with limited disruption the existing sequential code The flame code not restricted hydrocarbon fuels and can generalized other energetic fuels parallel reactive flow code will provide the Navy with very powerful tool study these fuels Applications High Performance Compilers Tools Questions about the system webserver webmaster umd eduProblems with publications homepage wes umd edu
