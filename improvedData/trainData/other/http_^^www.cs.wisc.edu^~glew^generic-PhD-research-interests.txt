Statement Purpose being prepared part application for admission studies Computer Architecture Electrical Computer Engineering Introduction goals for graduate study and professional career can briefly described leading edge research high performance low cost computing design section below discuss these goals more detail and also talk about career options computer architect industry and researcher industry and academia section discuss research interests section very high level indicating the true breadth interests but section very specific level that propose for research almost embarrassed admit the degree abstraction and the theoretical nature some the things discuss section mention them mainly show that not boring drone with one track mind incapable understanding contributing fields other than the one which specializing section propose particular plan research have great hope that will productive However since necessary balance the abstract ideas research interests with the practical details graduate school and professional career section provide brief autobiographical sketch the hope that this background may help explain why wish achieve some the things setting out and give credence likelihood achieving them Autobiographical Sketch graduated from McGill University with Eng Electrical Engineering Between and worked programmer computer graphics company Formic and operating systems development group Gould and performance analysis company that manufactured computers Motorola completed the University Illinois under Professor Wen Mei Hwu Although Master Thesis was topic multiprocessor cache protocols the bulk research was out order speculative CPU microarchitectures Starting work Intel got the chance apply CPU microarchitecture research which had actually begun while undergraduate McGill and carried through the University Illinois was one the five principal architects the now called Pentium Pro microprocessor one the first and still most aggressive out order speculative microprocessors Now that the processor project completed have decided complete the research which suspended five years ago also entering new role Intel the first member the Microcomputer Research Labs Intel Architecture group Although competing necessarily takes priority hope perform balancing act between academic research and industrial research Goals for Graduate Study and Professional Career goals for graduate school are follows have specific area mind research into advanced CPU microarchitectures hope that research will relevant earlier work and that the designs will investigate will practical enough influence the design computers industry the completion hope that research will influence the design computers shipping the years But open other topics described interests section section below should obvious from autobiographical sketch section that already well established professional career have occasionally been accused being overly theoretical academic analyses problems computer design have been sensitive the dictum Those who can Those who can teach research but think that successful role disproves this Long term wish continue leading edge work computer design initially industry but also perhaps academic setting stay with Intel career goal become Intel Fellow with technical seniority sufficient influence the direction the corporation not however have plans become exclusively manager the other hand considering returning university teach and research perhaps native country Canada always with the hope keeping industrial contacts increase the chances performing relevant research Research Interests section describe one particular area which interested doing research Before this though section describe some very broad areas that are interest But again before this describe motivation most succinctly section can seen that although have chosen particular very practical area applied and experimental research computer architecture interests are more general MotivationI want make computers faster want make computers faster relieve humans intellectual drudgery want make inexpensive computers faster fast enough support natural modes interaction with users want make inexpensive computers fast enough that non computer literate people like parents can use them want make computers faster fast enough that artificial intelligence can reasonably studied without the constraints insufficient computing resources think that the study computers produces insights into both intelligence and the structures mathematical and logical systems for the moment contribution make computers faster but eventually interested working these other areas knowledge Broad High Level Overall interested the augmentation human intelligence using computers interested enough that did not already have topic mind would consider doing applied research developing software such thinking tools agents and improved ways representing human knowledge such the yet unachieved ideal Vannevar Bush MEMEX hypertext system became obvious when first encountered such issues that the user interface was major obstacle truly creating tools that augment human intelligence Hence interest graphics virtual reality and speech and handwriting recognition the mid when started career was obvious that one the greatest obstacles such improved user interfaces and thinking tools was lack computational power Therefore have spent most career date improving computer systems performance that one day the user interfaces that wish use will cheap and ubiquitous Similarly the fact that most computer systems not provide real time responsiveness even when computationally capable obstacle human interaction with computers Hence involvement real time operating systems design when was software developer and provision the hardware prerequisites for providing real timeliness hardware developer remain interested the incorporation time criterion most computer systems primarily software design not much the sense hard real time but the sense compile this program giving the best code you can produce half hour Although chief focus has been computer design have remained somewhat involved the first two areas research investigating computer enhancements increase performance these areas specifically and also through involvement Intel Natural Datatypes Technical Committee case these interests are insufficiently abstruse also admit continued interest sociology and economics specifically market imperfections which seem closely related issues such the cost computation and also the theory imperfect incomplete systems both logical and algorithmic However order make progress life one must focus and propose focus the areas described section Specific Research Focus The area that propose research which has been the primary focus last ten years increasing the performance computers facilitate the applications both thinking and user interface describe above Specifically interest increasing the computing power available the average member our society Although have worked for supercomputer manufacturer research capacity not concerned with techniques that are applicable only supercomputers Although many supercomputer techniques are relevant the mass market microprocessors that most use many are not fact the moment mass market microprocessor design investigating many techniques that the old supercomputer manufacturers never considered More specifically propose research uniprocessor single CPU performance This not because think that research multiprocessors inappropriate just that think that there lot headroom for improvement single CPU performance Furthermore may become obvious the more detailed explanation research interests the style CPU microarchitecture which propose investigate may also serve bridge between uniprocessor and multiprocessor CPU design The basic problem modern computer design that the speed the CPU increasing faster than the speed memory Also the economics the memory DRAM market tend prohibit the parallel interleaved memory subsystem techniques that have been used traditional supercomputers increase performance Although such techniques will eventually applied the gap between CPU and memory performance growing basic approach investigate extremely aggressive advanced CPU microarchitectures extending out order speculative and dynamic execution far beyond what are currently implementing The hope that creating large pool possible memory references that can use the existing limited memory bandwidth efficient manner possible The techniques that currently have mind include Microarchitecture The following list techniques starts with the most aggressive ending with techniques that are only little bit beyond the present state the art industry Skip ahead Modern CPUs execute instructions parallel and out order but they continue fetch instructions largely sequential manner Rather than looking ahead the sequential instruction stream propose skip ahead and fetch discontiguous instruction packets For example propose microarchitectures that can determine when subsequent procedures are independent each other and which will fetch and execute those procedures parallel Related research includes the general topic multithreading advocated Tera Computers and also the multiscalar research being carried out Guri Sohi Wisconsin However while these other researchers posit explicitly parallel instruction set which will also consider see below optimistic that these techniques can applied equally well existing instruction sets seeking parallelism implicit existing single threaded program rather than the micro scale parallelism present CPU designs the macro scale parallelism true multiprocessors propose investigate meso scale parallelism have some hope that such designs might allow more gradual evolution into true multiprocessing hence overcoming the market barriers that have hindered multiprocessing real life therefore envisage computer systems which micro scale parallelism taken advantage dynamic execution techniques such and coworkers employed the Pentium Pro processor meso scale parallelism taken advantage skip ahead mechanisms describe above and macro scale parallelism taken advantage explicit multiprocessors Convergent Code Also known Minimal Control Dependencies from Tjaden and Flynn seminal paper the this based the observation that much the time modern processor with speculative branch execution work after the close the ENDIF part independent the path through through the The goal avoid needlessly throwing useful work away Incremental and Selective Speculation Recovery fact the theme avoiding needlessly throwing correct work away can extended forms speculation other than branch prediction such data speculation joyful synergy found because the general mechanism for solving this problem also seems solve the problems convergent code and skip ahead processing Eager Execution Finally will consider Eager Execution executing both sides branch However since this something that already the verge being implemented industry and since research date shows that its benefits are mixed introducing extra memory traffic due executing unneeded paths undesirable the memory starved processor model have mind consider that Eager Execution ancillary the techniques already mention However the same mechanisms that support the previous techniques also support Eager Execution would foolish not investigate Instruction Set Design Finally some betters Intel are encouraging investigate possible new ISA paradigms better matched modern microarchitecture Just RISC instruction sets were well matched the simple pipelined processors the early and VLIWs are well matched the processor designs the early possible that new style instruction set may better matched the out order speculative processor designs the present perhaps the memory starved processors the future always keep the possibility new instruction set principles the back mind but also take care resist succumbing temptation too easily have often found however that designing new instruction set features useful technique since once new features have been designed you have only devise equivalent way implicitly predicting performing the same function hardware without the new instruction set features Conclusion conclusion therefore interests are broad but plan focus single area applied experimental research computer architecture believe this area both relevant industry but also challenging enough warrant Header glew public html RCS generic PhD research interests html glew Exp
