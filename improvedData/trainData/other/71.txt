courses taught during previous semesters can found using the links the bottom this page Introduction Computer Programming introduction elementary computer programming concepts Emphasis techniques problem analysis and the development algorithms and programs The subject the course programming not particular programming language The principal programming language The course does not presume previous programming experience Programming assignments are tested and run interactive stand alone microcomputers Standard version COM college level mathematics assumed Introduction Computer Programming introduction elementary computer programming concepts Emphasis techniques problem analysis and the development algorithms and programs The subject the course programming not particular programming language The principal programming language The course does not presume previous programming experience Programming assignments are tested and run interactive stand alone microcomputers Alternative version COM emphasizing examples and applications involving continuous mathematics including trigonometry and calculus Computers and Programming Intermediate programming high level language and introduction computer science Topics include program development proofs program correctness program structure recursion abstract data types object oriented programming data structures and analysis algorithms Java and Gofer are the principal programming languages Structure and Interpretation Computer Programs introduction programming languages and computer science Topics covered include functional programming including recursive and higher order functions object oriented programming analysis and understanding algorithms and correctness programs Several substantial sized programming projects are done using Dylan dynamic object oriented programming language The aim the course expose students wide range interesting and challenging concepts computing using programming tool Discrete Structures Covers mathematical aspects programming and computing Topics will chosen from the following mathematical induction logical proof propositional and predicate calculus combinatorics and discrete mathematics covering manipulation sums recurrence relations and generating function techniques basic number theory sets functions and relations partially ordered sets graphs Introduction Digital Systems and Computer Organization Web course material includes course info lecture notes homeworks project info and hopefully even lecture videos Topics covered the course include representation information machine assembly languages particular PowerPC processor organization interrupts and memory hierarchies combinatorial and sequential circuits data path and control unit design RTL and microprogramming Programming Languages and Software Engineering introduction the programming languages tools and methods used modern software development Programming methodologies modularity data abstraction object oriented programming Programming tools software libraries and interface definition languages General techniques will complemented with programming experience Data Structures Lists trees graphs arrays and other forms data structure and their implementation Relationship between language and data structure emphasizing abstract data types Dynamic storage allocation and memory management Detailed study searching and sorting methods Analysis determine the more efficient algorithm given situation Systems Programming and Operating Systems introduction the logical design systems programs with emphasis multiprogrammed operating systems Topics include process synchronization deadlock memory management input output methods information sharing protection and security and file systems The impact network and distributed computing environments operating systems also discussed This fast paced subject requiring constant attention Foundations Artificial Intelligence challenging introduction the major subareas and current research directions artificial intelligence Topics include knowledge representation search problem solving natural language processing vision robotics logic and deduction planning and machine learning Automata and Computability Theory introduction the modern theory computing automata theory formal languages and effective computability faster moving and deeper version Credit will not given for both Corrective transfers between and are encouraged during the first few weeks instruction Advanced Database Systems Advanced Database Systems intended give students solid background the design and development database management systems DBMS While DBMS one sense giant application program there are surprisingly many principles behind its development and use The database research community also active and there are always new problems addressed because the explosive amounts data that people wish access This course forms essential background for anyone who wants become systems engineer database development company become informed user database systems become database systems researcher develop systems any domain that manipulate large amounts data find out how teller machine really works number advanced fundamental DBMS concepts will covered Although this not intended introductory course the discussion various topics will begin with quick review basic material terms workload the course involves two exams small survey paper and programming project See http www cornell edu Info People praveen for more details Advanced Programming Languages study programming paradigms functional imperative concurrent and logic programming Models programming languages including the lambda calculus Type systems polymorphism modules and other object oriented constructs Program transformations programming logic and applications programming methodology Multimedia Systems Hardware and software issues involved computer manipulation audio video and images Topics include media capture representation compression editing processing storage and transportation Special emphasis the processing digital video including algorithms for special effects and automatic extraction content and applications parallel architectures video processing Analysis Algorithms Methodology for developing efficient algorithms primarily for graph theoretic problems Understanding the inherent complexity natural problems via polynomial time algorithms randomized algorithms completeness randomized reducibilities Additional topics such parallel algorithms and efficient data structures Information from previous semesters Information from previous semesters may retained for while but don surprised certain links don work Fall Spring
