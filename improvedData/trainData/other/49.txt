tasks for the United States Air force Europe The system facilitates scheduling critical mission travel distinguished visitors and officers serving Europe the former Soviet Union and Africa well transcontinental flights the United States heterogeneous fleet Aircraft including and planes available with differing capacities endurance speed and facilities Each type aircraft allocated fixed number flying hours The objective the process maximize overall efficiency the fleet This done supporting travel many eligible personnel possible within the constraints fleet size flying hours and other limitations The software allows entering requests for travel and information about airports aircraft and passengers Missions can scheduled either manually utilizing the decision support module number tools are provided facilitate the scheduler task including maps tables feasibility checking and summaries available flying hours line access dakota The online access Dakota restricted one user
