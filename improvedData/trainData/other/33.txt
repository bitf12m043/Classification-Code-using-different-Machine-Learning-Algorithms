following schema used the Campus Book Store TOY toyno toyname toytype color price BOOK bookno bookname booktype price MANUF mname address phone STOCK itemno mname quantity the above primary keys are boldface You can assume that each STOCK itemno value refers either toy book but not both Each manufacturer can make toys books both Express the following queries the relational algebra and SQL Print the phone numbers manufacturers who make toy type bicycle and book type animal story Print the toy types where every known manufacturer makes least one toy that type Print the names manufacturers who make both toy type truck and book type bedtime story Print the names purple toys made Acme Toy Company where the store has least them stock Print the phone numbers the manufacturers who make the most expensive book known the store Answer last updated Thu Oct EDT Files Consider relation with attributes some variable size Suggest record structure for tuples Suggest page structure for pages Instead storing entire tuple record horizontal partitioning relation another alternative store each column value for all tuples contiguously vertical partitioning Why vertical partitioning usually bad idea The records page usually belong the same relation Why bad idea store records multiple relations the same page Find one counter example each the last two questions one query for which vertical partitioning good and one for which good store multiple relations records the same page Answer Indexes Consider tree index Write pseudo code for the insertion algorithm for leaf page involving splitting case overflow Change the pseudo code consider redistribution with neighbor what cases does each approach make sense consider many few concurrent users desire minimize disk usage etc Answer Memory Management Consider the LRU replacement policy for buffer pool Describe database query processing scenario for which LRU ideally suited Describe scenario for which LRU terrible What the principle behind LRU and why does the principle fail for the second scenario there some way improve LRU correctly apply the principle work more cases Answer Memory Management Suppose there enough main memory say the system hold relation and relation Now you want join and using nested loops join there difference now between tuple time nested loops join and page time nested loops join How about blocked nested loops join all the algorithms learnt what would you recommend the best one use Find counter example where your answer the previous question invalid Answer Join Algorithms Consider the problem joining tuple relation with tuple relation both relations tuples fit page The system page size bytes and the join predicate specifies equality join between attributes and Explain how the GRACE hash join algorithm works What will the total cost perform GRACE hash join and assuming that there just enough memory available Discuss the memory needs GRACE hash join What the worst case scenario and when might this occur Can the GRACE hash join used compute non equality join Explain why why not Answer Query Processing You are asked write duplicate eliminating projection operation for new relational DBMS Your boss expert join algorithms and you want impress adapting join techniques this problem How can sorting used for projection How would you make efficient use main memory for this task How can hashing used and how would you make efficient use main memory for this task Now can you get yourself promotion showing your boss that the same code can used for processing aggregates GROUPBY well Answer Query Optimization The System optimizer Selinger paper describes one particular query optimization algorithm for SQL queries Where the assumption about uniform distribution column values used How would you change histograms were maintained about the column frequency distributions What the notion interesting orders System supported GRACE hash join there analogous notion How would you change the cost formulas for access paths take into account the difference between sequential and random What equivalence transformations the relational algebra make join optimization large search problem Show example where the System optimizer would not even consider the optimal query plan Answer Query Optimization There are several heuristics which are also used query optimization Demonstrate selection pushdown and case where doesnt work Demonstrate projection pushdwon and case where doesnt work Consider query with expensive selections and projections addition joins Can you suggest extension the System optimizer join enumeration strategy that will also consider the appropriate placement expensive selections and projections Answer MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan

statements instead program problem var string begin writeln enter the substring readln writeln enter the superstring readln copy pos length pos PROBLEM The procedure all that needed program problem var string integer procedure vowelCount var string var numberOfVowels integer var integer chr string begin numberOfVowels while PROBLEM The procedure all that needed program problem type integerArray array integer var integerArray integer procedure fib var fibArray integerArray var integer var integer begin fibArray don worry that might less than fibArray while PROBLEM not every Pascal program algorithm All Pascal program meet the first few requirements because Pascal Machine Pascal operations are well ordered unambiguous and effectively computable However not all Pascal programs meet the last constraint That some Pascal programs fail halt finite time because they contain infinite loop such the following program program infiniteLoop var integer begin while writeln looping end PROBLEM Since have dealt with array class use four arrays store our information title stringarray artist stringarray recording studio stringarray stock integerarray also need variable keep track the number unique CDs the inventory know when stop the loop print out report procedure called Print used parameters title artist recording studio stringarray stock integerarray index integer Function Given index location prints out the contents all four arrays that index search define procedure search Parameters item searched string array searched stringarray position integer Function goes through the array searched and gets the position where finds match with item searched then calls Print output report and does this for the entire array calling search with different parameters say title and the array title etc can perform all the three searches required this case PROBLEM Database Machine can built top Pascal Machine writing Pascal program that runs the Pascal Nachine and implements the operations the Database Machine These operations might include add record delete record search for record and PROBLEM program problem type realArray array real var Arr realArray integer sum avg real begin readArray Arr sumArray Arr sum avg sum writeln average avg printArray end PROBLEM program problem type integerArray array integer var Arr integerArray integer begin Initialize the array zeros while begin writeln enter integer between and stop readln end write out the frequency integers that occurred more than once while then writeln occurred times end readln end PROBLEM procedure formal parameters may have different names than the actual parameters used call the procedure This important for making the procedure modular and enabling its reuse program may use procedure without knowing the names the variables that the procedure uses Also the procedure may used many programs each which calls the procedure with different actual parameters PROBLEM part sentence noun phrase verb phrase determiner noun verb noun phrase the girl chases determiner noun ball part conceivable that grammar checker could written using such rules The grammar checker would attempt generate each sentence written with the word processor Those sentences that can generated using the rules would deemed correct Those sentences that could not generated with the rules would deemed incorrect However the set rules would very large complete set rules for English has not been developed Date Tuesday Jan GMT Server NCSA MIME version Content type text html Last modified Friday Jan GMT Content length University
