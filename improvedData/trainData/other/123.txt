Evaluation and Research Agency DERA The terms reference assigned the Board requested determine the causes the launch failure investigate whether the qualification tests and acceptance tests were appropriate relation the problem encountered recommend corrective action remove the causes the anomaly and other possible weaknesses the systems found fault The Board started its work June was assisted Technical Advisory Committee composed Mauro Balduccini BPD Yvan Choquer Matra Marconi Space Remy Hergott CNES Bernard Humbert Aerospatiale Eric Lefort ESA accordance with its terms reference the Board concentrated its investigations the causes the failure the systems supposed responsible any failures similar nature similar systems and events that could linked the accident Consequently the recommendations made the Board are limited the areas examined The report contains the analysis the failure the Board conclusions and its recommendations for corrective measures most which should undertaken before the next flight Ariane There addition report for restricted circulation which the Board findings are documented greater technical detail Although consulted the telemetry data recorded during the flight the Board has not undertaken evaluation those data Nor has made complete review the whole launcher and all its systems This report the result collective effort the Commission assisted the members the Technical Advisory Committee have all worked hard present very precise explanation the reasons for the failure and make contribution towards the improvement Ariane software This improvement necessary ensure the success the programme The Board findings are based thorough and open presentations from the Ariane project teams and documentation which has demonstrated the high quality the Ariane programme regards engineering work general and completeness and traceability documents Chairman the Board THE FAILURE GENERAL DESCRIPTIONOn the basis the documentation made available and the information presented the Board the following has been observed The weather the launch site Kourou the morning June was acceptable for launch that day and presented obstacle the transfer the launcher the launch pad particular there was risk lightning since the strength the electric field measured the launch site was negligible The only uncertainty concerned fulfilment the visibility criteria The countdown which also comprises the filling the core stage went smoothly until minutes when the launch was put hold since the visibility criteria were not met the opening the launch window local time Visibility conditions improved forecast and the launch was initiated local time Ignition the Vulcain engine and the two solid boosters was nominal was lift off The vehicle performed nominal flight until approximately seconds Shortly after that time suddenly veered off its flight path broke and exploded preliminary investigation flight data showed nominal behaviour the launcher seconds failure the back Inertial Reference System followed immediately failure the active Inertial Reference System swivelling into the extreme position the nozzles the two solid boosters and slightly later the Vulcain engine causing the launcher veer abruptly self destruction the launcher correctly triggered rupture the links between the solid boosters and the core stage The origin the failure was thus rapidly narrowed down the flight control system and more particularly the Inertial Reference Systems which obviously ceased function almost simultaneously around seconds INFORMATION AVAILABLEThe information available the launch includes telemetry data received the ground until seconds trajectory data from radar stations optical observations camera films inspection recovered material The whole the telemetry data received Kourou was transferred CNES Toulouse where the data were converted into parameter over time plots CNES provided copy the data Aerospatiale which carried out analyses concentrating mainly the data concerning the electrical system RECOVERY MATERIALThe self destruction the launcher occurred near the launch pad altitude approximately Therefore all the launcher debris fell back onto the ground scattered over area approximately east the launch pad Recovery material proved difficult however since this area nearly all mangrove swamp savanna Nevertheless was possible retrieve from the debris the two Inertial Reference Systems particular interest was the one which had worked active mode and stopped functioning last and for which therefore certain information was not available the telemetry data provision for transmission ground this information was confined whichever the two units might fail first The results the examination this unit were very helpful the analysis the failure sequence UNRELATED ANOMALIES OBSERVEDPost flight analysis telemetry has shown number anomalies which have been reported the Board They are mostly minor significance and such expected demonstration flight One anomaly which was brought the particular attention the Board was the gradual development starting seconds variations the hydraulic pressure the actuators the main engine nozzle These variations had frequency approximately There are some preliminary explanations the cause these variations which are now under investigation After consideration the Board has formed the opinion that this anomaly while significant has bearing the failure Ariane ANALYSIS THE FAILURE CHAIN TECHNICAL EVENTSIn general terms the Flight Control System the Ariane standard design The attitude the launcher and its movements space are measured Inertial Reference System SRI has its own internal computer which angles and velocities are calculated the basis information from strap down inertial platform with laser gyros and accelerometers The data from the SRI are transmitted through the databus the Board Computer OBC which executes the flight program and controls the nozzles the solid boosters and the Vulcain cryogenic engine via servovalves and hydraulic actuators order improve reliability there considerable redundancy equipment level There are two SRIs operating parallel with identical hardware and software One SRI active and one hot stand and the OBC detects that the active SRI has failed immediately switches the other one provided that this unit functioning properly Likewise there are two OBCs and number other units the Flight Control System are also duplicated The design the Ariane SRI practically the same that SRI which presently used Ariane particularly regards the software Based the extensive documentation and data the Ariane failure made available the Board the following chain events their inter relations and causes have been established starting with the destruction the launcher and tracing back time towards the primary cause The launcher started disintegrate about seconds because high aerodynamic loads due angle attack more than degrees that led separation the boosters from the main stage turn triggering the self destruct system the launcher This angle attack was caused full nozzle deflections the solid boosters and the Vulcain main engine These nozzle deflections were commanded the Board Computer OBC software the basis data transmitted the active Inertial Reference System SRI Part these data that time did not contain proper flight data but showed diagnostic bit pattern the computer the SRI which was interpreted flight data The reason why the active SRI did not send correct attitude data was that the unit had declared failure due software exception The OBC could not switch the back SRI because that unit had already ceased function during the previous data cycle milliseconds period for the same reason SRI The internal SRI software exception was caused during execution data conversion from bit floating point bit signed integer value The floating point number which was converted had value greater than what could represented bit signed integer This resulted Operand Error The data conversion instructions Ada code were not protected from causing Operand Error although other conversions comparable variables the same place the code were protected The error occurred part the software that only performs alignment the strap down inertial platform This software module computes meaningful results only before lift off soon the launcher lifts off this function serves purpose The alignment function operative for seconds after starting the Flight Mode the SRIs which occurs seconds for Ariane Consequently when lift off occurs the function continues for approx seconds flight This time sequence based requirement Ariane and not required for Ariane The Operand Error occurred due unexpected high value internal alignment function result called Horizontal Bias related the horizontal velocity sensed the platform This value calculated indicator for alignment precision over time The value was much higher than expected because the early part the trajectory Ariane differs from that Ariane and results considerably higher horizontal velocity values The SRI internal events that led the failure have been reproduced simulation calculations Furthermore both SRIs were recovered during the Board investigation and the failure context was precisely determined from memory readouts addition the Board has examined the software code which was shown consistent with the failure scenario The results these examinations are documented the Technical Report Therefore established beyond reasonable doubt that the chain events set out above reflects the technical causes the failure Ariane COMMENTS THE FAILURE SCENARIOIn the failure scenario the primary technical causes are the Operand Error when converting the horizontal bias variable and the lack protection this conversion which caused the SRI computer stop has been stated the Board that not all the conversions were protected because maximum workload target had been set for the SRI computer determine the vulnerability unprotected code analysis was performed every operation which could give rise exception including Operand Error particular the conversion floating point values integers was analysed and operations involving seven variables were risk leading Operand Error This led protection being added four the variables evidence which appears the Ada code However three the variables were left unprotected reference justification this decision was found directly the source code Given the large amount documentation associated with any industrial application the assumption although agreed was essentially obscured though not deliberately from any external review The reason for the three remaining variables including the one denoting horizontal bias being unprotected was that further reasoning indicated that they were either physically limited that there was large margin safety reasoning which the case the variable turned out faulty important note that the decision protect certain variables but not others was taken jointly project partners several contractual levels There evidence that any trajectory data were used analyse the behaviour the unprotected variables and even more important note that was jointly agreed not include the Ariane trajectory data the SRI requirements and specification Although the source the Operand Error has been identified this itself did not cause the mission fail The specification the exception handling mechanism also contributed the failure the event any kind exception the system specification stated that the failure should indicated the databus the failure context should stored EEPROM memory which was recovered and read out for Ariane and finally the SRI processor should shut down was the decision cease the processor operation which finally proved fatal Restart not feasible since attitude too difficult calculate after processor shutdown therefore the Inertial Reference System becomes useless The reason behind this drastic action lies the culture within the Ariane programme only addressing random hardware failures From this point view exception error handling mechanisms are designed for random hardware failure which can quite rationally handled backup system Although the failure was due systematic software design error mechanisms can introduced mitigate this type problem For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued provide their best estimates the required attitude information There reason for concern that software exception should allowed even required cause processor halt while handling mission critical equipment Indeed the loss proper software function hazardous because the same software runs both SRI units the case Ariane this resulted the switch off two still healthy critical units equipment The original requirement acccounting for the continued operation the alignment software after lift off was brought forward more than years ago for the earlier models Ariane order cope with the rather unlikely event hold the count down between seconds when flight mode starts the SRI Ariane and seconds when certain events are initiated the launcher which take several hours reset The period selected for this continued alignment operation seconds after the start flight mode was based the time needed for the ground equipment resume full control the launcher the event hold This special feature made possible with the earlier versions Ariane restart the count down without waiting for normal alignment which takes minutes more that short launch window could still used fact this feature was used once Flight The same requirement does not apply Ariane which has different preparation sequence and was maintained for commonality reasons presumably based the view that unless proven necessary was not wise make changes software which worked well Ariane Even those cases where the requirement found still valid questionable for the alignment function operating after the launcher has lifted off Alignment mechanical and laser strap down platforms involves complex mathematical filter functions properly align the axis the gravity axis and find north direction from Earth rotation sensing The assumption preflight alignment that the launcher positioned known and fixed position Therefore the alignment function totally disrupted when performed during flight because the measured movements the launcher are interpreted sensor offsets and other coefficients characterising sensor behaviour Returning the software error the Board wishes point out that software expression highly detailed design and does not fail the same sense mechanical system Furthermore software flexible and expressive and thus encourages highly demanding requirements which turn lead complex implementations which are difficult assess underlying theme the development Ariane the bias towards the mitigation random failure The supplier the SRI was only following the specification given which stipulated that the event any detected exception the processor was stopped The exception which occurred was not due random failure but design error The exception was detected but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should considered correct until shown fault The Board has reason believe that this view also accepted other areas Ariane software design The Board favour the opposite view that software should assumed faulty until applying the currently accepted best practice methods can demonstrate that correct This means that critical software the sense that failure the software puts the mission risk must identified very detailed level that exceptional behaviour must confined and that reasonable back policy must take software failures into account THE TESTING AND QUALIFICATION PROCEDURESThe Flight Control System qualification for Ariane follows standard procedure and performed the following levels Equipment qualification Software qualification Board Computer software Stage integration System validation tests The logic applied check each level what could not achieved the previous level thus eventually providing complete test coverage each sub system and the integrated system Testing equipment level was the case the SRI conducted rigorously with regard all environmental factors and fact beyond what was expected for Ariane However test was performed verify that the SRI would behave correctly when being subjected the count down and flight time sequence and the trajectory Ariane should noted that for reasons physical law not feasible test the SRI black box the flight environment unless one makes completely realistic flight test but possible ground testing injecting simulated accelerometric signals accordance with predicted flight parameters while also using turntable simulate launcher angular movements Had such test been performed the supplier part the acceptance test the failure mechanism would have been exposed The main explanation for the absence this test has already been mentioned above the SRI specification which supposed requirements document for the SRI does not contain the Ariane trajectory data functional requirement The Board has also noted that the systems specification the SRI does not indicate operational restrictions that emerge from the chosen implementation Such declaration limitation which should mandatory for every mission critical device would have served identify any non compliance with the trajectory Ariane The other principal opportunity detect the failure mechanism beforehand was during the numerous tests and simulations carried out the Functional Simulation Facility ISF which the site the Industrial Architect The scope the ISF testing qualify the guidance navigation and control performance the whole flight envelope the sensors redundancy operation the dedicated functions the stages the flight software Board Computer compliance with all equipment the Flight Control Electrical System large number closed loop simulations the complete flight simulating ground segment operation telemetry flow and launcher dynamics were run order verify the nominal trajectory trajectories degraded with respect internal launcher parameters trajectories degraded with respect atmospheric parameters equipment failures and the subsequent failure isolation and recoveryIn these tests many equipment items were physically present and exercised but not the two SRIs which were simulated specifically developed software modules Some open loop tests verify compliance the Board Computer and the SRI were performed with the actual SRI understood that these were just electrical integration tests and low level bus communication compliance tests not mandatory even preferable that all the parts the subsystem are present all the tests given level Sometimes this not physically possible not possible exercise them completely representative way these cases logical replace them with simulators but only after careful check that the previous test levels have covered the scope completely This procedure especially important for the final system test before the system operationally used the tests performed the launcher itself are not addressed here since they are not specific the Flight Control Electrical System qualification order understand the explanations given for the decision not have the SRIs the closed loop simulation necessary describe the test configurations that might have been used Because not possible simulate the large linear accelerations the launcher all three axes test bench discussed above there are two ways put the SRI the loop put three axis dynamic table stimulate the Ring Laser Gyros and substitute the analog output the accelerometers which can not stimulated mechanically simulation via dedicated test input connector and electronic board designed for this purpose This similar the method mentioned connection with possible testing equipment level substitute both the analog output the accelerometers and the Ring Laser Gyros via dedicated test input connector with signals produced simulation The first approach likely provide accurate simulation within the limits the three axis dynamic table bandwidth and quite expensive the second cheaper and its performance depends essentially the accuracy the simulation both cases large part the electronics and the complete software are tested the real operating environment When the project test philosophy was defined the importance having the SRIs the loop was recognized and decision was taken select method above later stage the programme this decision was changed was decided not have the actual SRIs the loop for the following reasons The SRIs should considered fully qualified equipment levelThe precision the navigation software the Board Computer depends critically the precision the SRI measurements the ISF this precision could not achieved the electronics creating the test signals The simulation failure modes not possible with real equipment but only with model The base period the SRI millisecond whilst that the simulation the ISF milliseconds This adds the complexity the interfacing electronics and may further reduce the precision the simulation The opinion the Board that these arguments were technically valid but since the purpose system simulation test not only verify the interfaces but also verify the system whole for the particular application there was definite risk assuming that critical equipment such the SRI had been validated qualification its own previous use Ariane While high accuracy simulation desirable the ISF system tests clearly better compromise accuracy but achieve all other objectives amongst them prove the proper system integration equipment such the SRI The precision the guidance system can effectively demonstrated analysis and computer simulation Under this heading should noted finally that the overriding means preventing failures are the reviews which are integral part the design and qualification process and which are carried out all levels and involve all major partners the project well external experts programme this size literally thousands problems and potential failures are successfully handled the review process and obviously not easy detect software design errors the type which were the primary technical cause the failure Nevertheless evident that the limitations the SRI software were not fully analysed the reviews and was not realised that the test coverage was inadequate expose such limitations Nor were the possible implications allowing the alignment software operate during flight realised these respects the review process was contributory factor the failure POSSIBLE OTHER WEAKNESSES SYSTEMS INVOLVEDIn accordance with its termes reference the Board has examined possible other weaknesses primarily the Flight Control System weaknesses were found which were related the failure but spite the short time available the Board has conducted extensive review the Flight Control System based experience gained during the failure analysis The review has covered the following areas The design the electrical system Embedded board software subsystems other than the Inertial Reference System The Board Computer and the flight program software addition the Board has made analysis methods applied the development programme particular regards software development methodology The results these efforts have been documented the Technical Report and the hope the Board that they will contribute further improvement the Ariane Flight Control System and its software CONCLUSIONS FINDINGSThe Board reached the following findings During the launch preparation campaign and the count down events occurred which were related the failure The meteorological conditions the time the launch were acceptable and did not play any part the failure other external factors have been found relevance Engine ignition and lift off were essentially nominal and the environmental effects noise and vibration the launcher and the payload were not found relevant the failure Propulsion performance was within specification seconds after command for main cryogenic engine ignition variations frequency started appear the hydraulic pressure the actuators which control the nozzle the main engine This phenomenon significant and has not yet been fully explained but after consideration has not been found relevant the failure seconds after approx seconds after lift off the computer within the back inertial reference system which was working stand for guidance and attitude control became inoperative This was caused internal variable related the horizontal velocity the launcher exceeding limit which existed the software this computer Approx seconds later the active inertial reference system identical the back system hardware and software failed for the same reason Since the back inertial system was already inoperative correct guidance and attitude information could longer obtained and loss the mission was inevitable result its failure the active inertial reference system transmitted essentially diagnostic information the launcher main computer where was interpreted flight data and used for flight control calculations the basis those calculations the main computer commanded the booster nozzles and somewhat later the main engine nozzle also make large correction for attitude deviation that had not occurred rapid change attitude occurred which caused the launcher disintegrate seconds after due aerodynamic forces Destruction was automatically initiated upon disintegration designed altitude and distance from the launch pad The debris was spread over area Amongst the equipment recovered were the two inertial reference systems They have been used for analysis The post flight analysis telemetry data has listed number additional anomalies which are being investigated but are not considered significant the failure The inertial reference system Ariane essentially common system which presently flying Ariane The part the software which caused the interruption the inertial system computers used before launch align the inertial reference system and Ariane also enable rapid realignment the system case late hold the countdown This realignment function which does not serve any purpose Ariane was nevertheless retained for commonality reasons and allowed Ariane operate for approx seconds after lift off During design the software the inertial reference system used for Ariane and Ariane decision was taken that was not necessary protect the inertial system computer from being made inoperative excessive value the variable related the horizontal velocity protection which was provided for several other variables the alignment software When taking this design decision was not analysed fully understood which values this particular variable might assume when the alignment software was allowed operate after lift off Ariane flights using the same type inertial reference system there has been such failure because the trajectory during the first seconds flight such that the particular variable related horizontal velocity cannot reach with adequate operational margin value beyond the limit present the software Ariane has high initial acceleration and trajectory which leads build horizontal velocity which five times more rapid than for Ariane The higher horizontal velocity Ariane generated within the second timeframe the excessive value which caused the inertial system computers cease operation The purpose the review process which involves all major partners the Ariane programme validate design decisions and obtain flight qualification this process the limitations the alignment software were not fully analysed and the possible implications allowing continue function during flight were not realised The specification the inertial reference system and the tests performed equipment level did not specifically include the Ariane trajectory data Consequently the realignment function was not tested under simulated Ariane flight conditions and the design error was not discovered would have been technically feasible include almost the entire inertial reference system the overall system simulations which were performed For number reasons was decided use the simulated output the inertial reference system not the system itself its detailed simulation Had the system been included the failure could have been detected Post flight simulations have been carried out computer with software the inertial reference system and with simulated environment including the actual trajectory data from the Ariane flight These simulations have faithfully reproduced the chain events leading the failure the inertial reference systems CAUSE THE FAILUREThe failure the Ariane was caused the complete loss guidance and attitude information seconds after start the main engine ignition sequence seconds after lift off This loss information was due specification and design errors the software the inertial reference system The extensive reviews and tests carried out during the Ariane Development Programme did not include adequate analysis and testing the inertial reference system the complete flight control system which could have detected the potential failure RECOMMENDATIONSOn the basis its analyses and conclusions the Board makes the following recommendations Switch off the alignment function the inertial reference system immediately after lift off More generally software function should run during flight unless needed Prepare test facility including much real equipment technically feasible inject realistic input data and perform complete closed loop system testing Complete simulations must take place before any mission high test coverage has obtained not allow any sensor such the inertial reference system stop sending best effort data Organize for each item equipment incorporating software specific software qualification review The Industrial Architect shall take part these reviews and report complete system testing performed with the equipment All restrictions use the equipment shall made explicit for the Review Board Make all critical software Configuration Controlled Item CCI Review all flight software including embedded software and particular Identify all implicit assumptions made the code and its justification documents the values quantities provided the equipment Check these assumptions against the restrictions use the equipment Verify the range values taken any internal communication variables the software Solutions potential problems the board computer software paying particular attention board computer switch over shall proposed the project team and reviewed group external experts who shall report the board computer Qualification Board Wherever technically feasible consider confining exceptions tasks and devise backup capabilities Provide more data the telemetry upon failure any component that recovering equipment will less essential Reconsider the definition critical components taking failures software origin into account particularly single point failures Include external the project participants when reviewing specifications code and justification documents Make sure that these reviews consider the substance arguments rather than check that verifications have been made Include trajectory data specifications and test requirements Review the test coverage existing equipment and extend where deemed necessary Give the justification documents the same attention code Improve the technique for keeping code and its justifications consistent Set team that will prepare the procedure for qualifying software propose stringent rules for confirming such qualification and ascertain that specification verification and testing software are consistently high quality the Ariane programme Including external RAMS experts considered more transparent organisation the cooperation among the partners the Ariane programme must considered Close engineering cooperation with clear cut authority and responsibility needed achieve system coherence with
