transformation systems main research interests lie the field meta programming Meta programming the activity creating programs that write other programs even themselves find both the theoretical and the practical aspects meta programming particularly fascinating belief that with the right support tools meta programming can not only become realistic programming technique but also significantly help the software design process Research Work member the Software Systems Generator Research Group working under the supervision Don Batory The group work concerns software system generators tools for assembling complex software from interchangeable reusable components Current ProjectsMy current work focuses both meta programming applications and language support essence generators and tools construct them Support for this project has been provided Microsoft Research Additionally during the past two summers worked for the Intentional Programming group MSR part this work designed and implemented code template operators for Meta programming Language SupportThe best known example language support for meta programming are the backquote and comma operators LISP and its variants Various techniques have been used for instance hygienic macro expansion facilitate writing programs that manipulate code fragments Unfortunately such techniques are oriented towards small scale program rewrites that are fairly local hygienic macro expansion fact based generating related code fragments single step work mainly tools help manipulate code fragments generated and altered many distinct program components acting different time instances These tools have been heavily used the implementation the DiSTiL application generator see below Meta programming ApplicationsFor the past year been working DiSTiL software generator for data structures The goal DiSTiL increase productivity enabling programming high level data structures primitives DiSTiL programs are automatically checked for consistency and transformed into efficient code DiSTiL packaged library for the Intentional Programming system The library structure highly factored with large number orthogonal abstract components These can composed variety ways form wide range concrete data structures DiSTiL has been demonstrated the ICSR International Conference Software Reuse and the Component Based Software
