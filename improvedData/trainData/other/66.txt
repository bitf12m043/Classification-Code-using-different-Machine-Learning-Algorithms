session Retrospective Where from here Binary trees Recursive search procedures More examples divide and conquer Algorithms and their worst case costs Binary search and mergesort Demos mergesort Unlike the demo lecture this program actually works Recursion Divide and conquer tool for solving problems Finding all combinations and permutations letters string Readings Chapter Queues Readings Sections Demos queue Abstract data types Concrete representations abstractions Dictionaries and stacks Readings Sections Hash tables hash table trick for speeding access the elements linked list splitting the list into many separate lists stored array find out which list each element goes one uses hash function that transforms each element into consistent but random looking number The effect bit like using filing cabinet with many separate folders store data instead one big stack paper See the demo program for example Demos hashtable Linked lists Traversal insertion deletion Demos linkedLists pReadings Sections Pointer basics Declaring pointer variables Operations pointers New and Dispose Declaring and adding elements linked list Readings Sections More file munching Using files communicate between different programs Demos draw Drawing program that saves its work file redraw Displays files the format generated draw autodraw Generates file suitable for loading redraw circle Output autodraw monet formerly huge drawing smiley face signed the master This compressed version the test file drawn class The compression was done Unix machine using program written Perl which demonstrates how data files with well defined formats can manipulated wide variety tools picasso Another fine work art from class Handouts Assignment Eight Files Reading and Writing files Basic file commands Reset Rewrite Close NewFilename OldFilename Readings Sections Demos cheapEdit Sets Readings Sections Demos sets Operations characters Chr and Ord Parsing using finite state machines Readings Section Handouts Assignment Seven Built functions for manipulating strings pos copy omit include and concat Readings Section Demos replacer With bonus YesMaster procedure not shown lecture Strings and characters The Length function Treating string like array characters Readings Sections plus Length description Demos stringMauler Variant records Readings Sections and Demos cheapdraw pHandouts Assignment Six Enumerated data types Readings Sections and Demos conquest This program didn appear all lecture but wrote beforehand while playing around with enumerated data types and has some nice examples doing things with them and arrays figured would make more sense put here than let waste Multi dimensional arrays and their uses Readings Section Ignore the discussion Section parallel arrays The technique discussed there almost always better done with array records described Section Demos toxic This version slightly improved from the one shown lecture includes version ButtonClick that works better Midterm The midterm will give class the usual time and location will closed book test covering everything discussed class You should comfortable with the material Chapters Sections only and Sections and and the book sample midterm available showing roughly the length and types questions you should expect you may wish try going through this before the review session see you have any questions Note that questions the sample midterm are not exhaustive the real midterm may touch different subjects and use different types questions Handouts Assignment Five Review session More tricks with arrays Computing minima and maxima searching sorting Readings Sections Demos arrayMauler Arrays Readings Sections Demos arrayExample Records and abstract data types Readings Section Yes this skipping ahead lot come back Demos abstractBall Procedures with state Most procedures maintain information from one call the next they always act exactly the same way Sometimes this isn what want used global variable call reference parameter can produce procedures like iterators returning etc pseudorandom number generators which return random looking numbers see also the library useful procedures Examples using call reference parameters and functions Getting input from the mouse Demos average illustrates use various techniques return information from procedures mouse simple drawing program button Detecting button clicks Handouts Assignment Four How Pascal uses memory Global variables local variables Call reference var parameters Functions Readings Sections Examples using while and repeat until loops Demos loopdemo More applications loops animation Unbounded loops Handouts Assignment Three Demos animation pReadings Sections More about for loops Debugging Fencepost errors Demos dashes ptimestables Introduction loops Bounded loops for and for downto Demos bottles Bottles Beer the Wall simple program using for loop circles Draws bunch circles example nested for loops Readings Sections first part The case statement Local variables Demos personality Case statement demo Handouts Assignment Two Readings Section case statement Sections More tricks with then statements Boolean expressions and variables Preview recursion Demos admission Yale College admissions program fancyFaces blinking faces recursive bomb timer program using recursive procedures Readings Sections Resist the temptation read Section the description how get the mouse position will not work Think Pascal Pascal syntax and the mysteries semicolon placement Begin end blocks then statements Readings Sections various forms then statements More graphics Decomposing tasks into subtasks and then building procedures all the subtasks Demos face Draws bunch cartoon faces Handouts Homework OneReadings Sections basic graphics commands Arithmetic Integers reals Graphics commands Demos drawing Basic drawing commands Readings Sections arithmetic drawing lines Declaring and using constants and procedures How avoiding redundancy increases clarity and power programs Demos Old MacDonald program Handouts HOW sheet Readings Sections simple procedures constants procedures with parameters You should probably also read Sections and input and output Introduction How the course set What programming all about Running Think Pascal Demos boring pHandouts Course InformationHomework ZeroIntroductory computer

project develop tools for exploratory analysis large non traditional datasets The name the project acronym Non traditional data EXploration Toolkit that also play the fact that major emphasis supporting sequence data exploration use the term sequence broadly and include examples trace data time series data from variety domains and satellite sensor observations The NEXT project has three main components First there visual data exploration tool called DEVise that supports paradigm called visual queries Each visual query essence abstract description how collection sequence data mapped the user screen The query serves template that can applied any data set with the appropriate schema and the visual presentation can subsequently explored detail standard operations such scrolling zooming and probing The second component NEXT system called SEQ that supports SQL style queries over sequence data SEQ distinguished from standard SQL that provides easy and efficient ways pose queries that use the sequentiality the data set for example Find the day moving average IBM SEQ can used conjunction with DeVise with DeVise serving visual browser and SEQ data manipulation backend The third component NEXT going effort investigate novel ways analysing large data sets often called data mining particular have developed tool called BIRCH that can effectively cluster very large data sets
