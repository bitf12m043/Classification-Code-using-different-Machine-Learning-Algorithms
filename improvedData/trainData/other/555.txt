transforms which uses inside the Image module You will write the transform Tview Tpers and apply few simple objects The resulting program will allow you view the objects world view and screen coordinates Procedure First you need download several example files this click each the filenames shown below When the text window opens use the save option put the file your own directory Name each file with the same name shown below CameraTemplate net CameraTemplate cfg Part CameraTemplate net constructs simple object made two cubes and few spheres see Images Fill the formulas the compute modules simulate the Tview and Tpers matrices given class and Watt pages and Note that used right handed display system you will have negate the view coordinate Notice that the program computes and vectors for you based the values the interactors Note that the images with the exeception the world image are incorrect until you fill the compute modules Part Add interactor which independently window height sets the width the view window Note that this operation will distort the picture because maps rectangular region square Part Convert the viewing frustrum given the program from view coordinates back world coordinates using inverse camera transform and collect with the original objects that the viewpoint and viewing frustrum are visible the world coordinate Image window There are three Image modules and one Display module that you can see the world view and screen coordinate systems plus the final view the object The Camera Display modules are hardcoded view the computed perspective from the correct angle The following images are example what the program should produce World Coordinates View Coordinates Screen Coordinates Screen Projection Questions Writeup Write out the formula from each compute module used for each transformation prepared demo your synthetic camera exercising all interactors given the template The program should include the viewing frustrum world coordinates The program should also include the modification for variable window width usual style counts Your network will graded readability and comments What happens vertex the object falls the plane Remove the clipbox module and explain what you see the object behind the viewpoint Back Main Page Lab Last modified Land Copyright Statement MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT
