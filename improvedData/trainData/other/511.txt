Cornell Nanofabrication Facility Phillips Hall nmacd cornell edu California Berkeley Biography After receiving his doctorate electrical engineering MacDonald remained Berkeley for year acting assistant professor became member the technical staff the Rockwell International Science Center and joined Physical Electronics Industries Inc entrepreneur instrumentation engineer and manager Physical Electronics was acquired the Perkin Elmer Corporation and from then until MacDonald held management positions Perkin Elmer these included the position general manager for the Physical Electronics Division attended the Harvard Business School Program for Management Development came Cornell professor electrical engineering and director the Program Microscience and Technology which sponsored the Semiconductor Research Corporation was appointed director the School Electrical Engineering MacDonald has specialized electron beam technology with emphasis microelectronic applications was instrumental combining Auger electron spectroscopy with scanning electron microscopy and developing the scanning Auger microprobe received the Victor Macres Memorial Award the Electron Probe Analysis Society America and Young Engineer the Year Award presented the Institute Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE serves the SEMATECH University Advisory Board the International MEMS Steering Committee and the Advisory Board for the International Symposium Electron Ion and Photon Beams EIPB chaired the EIPB symposium member IEEE the American Physical Society the American Vacuum Society the Electrochemical Society and the Materials Research Society Research InterestsThe theme our research nanostructure fabrication and characterization are interested the ultimate spatial limits for fabricating probing and modeling nanometer size electronic and mechanical structures Consequently research projects that address the generation and application focused electron beams for nanofabrication along with computer simulation and modeling are included the program Research subjects include fabrication nanometer scale electron devices and nanomechanical structures for information storage vacuum microelectronics electron beam microinstrumentation for lithography and characterization electron beam time resolved probing integrated circuits and nanostructures electron scattering and energy dissipation solids electron beam lithography and nanosensors The goal this research better understand the physical limits for fabrication integration characterization and inspection nanostructures Current Research ProjectsNanostructure Fabrication Electromechanical Optical and Electronic Devices Nanosensors and Nanoanalytic Instruments Simulation Electron Beam
