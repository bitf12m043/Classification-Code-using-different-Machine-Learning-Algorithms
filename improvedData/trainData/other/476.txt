Mathematics Environments Paul Chew Robert Constable Keshav Pingali Steve Vavasis Richard Zippel Computational science will the dominant paradigm for science the next century This proposal addresses one the major challenges facing this new kind science the demand for better software support for computational mathematics The task providing this support sufficiently central the national interest and sufficiently comprehensive that could serve Grand Challenge problem for computer science strategy for meeting this challenge has evolved from inter project cooperation Cornell the elements scientific computing This proposal represents collaboration among five computer scientists with diverse backgrounds scientific computing computational geometry computer algebra applied logic and programming languages various combinations these people have worked together and software from their separate projects has been linked Their experience with the difficulty this linking process has led the identification and the prospective solutions three major problems the connectivity problem the code generation problem and the explanation problem The problems and their solutions are briefly explained below This proposal outlines plan design and implement open system architecture that will integrate variety computational science tools into environment that supports collaborative activity Many interesting and powerful tools exist support computational mathematics for example Matlab Lapack Mathematica Axiom Ellpack PLTMG Autocad and LEDA but most these are focused one specific area one specific style computation These systems are largely self contained and closed connecting other software only very low level abstraction using for instance string string communication They not have common semantic base that would allow one system collaborate with another This the connectivity problem address the connectivity problem common mathematical bus the MathBus will serve the backbone the system Its communication protocols will based typed formal language which provides the semantics for collaboration major design objective raise the level communication among software tools allowing the communication mathematical objects instead being restricted simple strings Although existing software has contributed substantially scientific programming productivity the time taken generate code remains major impediment progress computational science This the code creation problem part this problem due the difficulty expressing certain mathematical techniques subroutines The problem code creation addressed with method transformation and refinement allowing the transformation high level mathematical expressions into more traditional code One the reasons that sharing code with colleague difficult because there common language for explaining what program does and for precisely giving the conditions necessary apply This the explanation problem The solution the connectivity problem also provides approach explanation namely provide formal and semi formal semantic standards for communications and linkage the proposed MathBus The problem solutions outlined here lead additional opportunity Once tools can inter operate and mathematical models can shared becomes possible create collections mathematical theorems explanations and examples and counterexamples Such mathematical database could capture important part mathematical knowledge that best poorly represented books and journals Collaborative Mathematics EnvironmentsPaul Chew Robert Constable Keshav Pingali Steve
