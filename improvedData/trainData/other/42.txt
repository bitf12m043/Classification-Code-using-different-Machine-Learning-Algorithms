Ray Tracing Program Ray Tracing Due May NOTE Assignment OPTION replace the second exam You are implement simple ray tracer which will allow for both mirrorlike polygons and transparent mirrorlike spheres You may assume that the only objects your scene will spheres polygons and you may assume that you have only very few objects the scene Your objects should specified center radius diffuse color specular color opacity and material for spheres and list vertices you may assume maximum vertices and the two color parameters for polygons You should also able specify color for the background the scene You should able place the viewer anywhere the scene specifying eye lookat point and top head point and you should able specify the width height number pixels wide and number pixels high window centered distance specified you along the viewing vector Your goal will produce interesting picture least one mirrored sphere and one clear sphere front large polygonal mirror showing interreflections and refraction effects You can assume that all light sources are directional points infinity and that you have more than light sources You should also able specify the position these All specifications the scene geometry should ascii input file which your program reads produce the internal description the situation You then run the ray tracing program produce array pixel colors the size specified for your window which your program outputs ppm see below file You can then use the filter pnmtotiff create tiff file which can displayed using that you need not write any display software You will need write routines for creating ray from the eye through the center each pixel the window computing the intersection any ray with sphere polygon computing the normal the sphere the polygon the intersection point computing the reflected and refracted needed rays from the intersection point and computing rays from the intersection point each light source You should use the Phong lighting model evaluate the local illumination for each point you will also need routine evaluate this model Remember that ray tracers are recursive you will need make sure the recursion terminates reasonable point the calculation There user interface requirement for this assignment You can use text editor create the input file and you will use display your results Once you have the ray tracer working you can expect get some really ugly pictures first Plan spend some time tweaking the parameters your Phong model make the images look more realistic ppm portable pixmap file format The portable pixmap format lowest common denominator color image file format The definition follows magic number for identifying the file type ppm file magic number the two characters Whitespace blanks TABs CRs LFs width formatted ASCII characters decimal Whitespace height again ASCII decimal Whitespace The maximum color component value again ASCII decimal Whitespace Width height pixels each three ASCII decimal values between and the specified maximum value starting the top left corner the pixmap proceeding normal English reading order The three values for each pixel represent red green and blue respectively value means that color off and the maximum value means that color maxxed out Characters from the next end line are ignored comments line should longer than characters Here example small pixmap this format feep ppm Programs that read this format should lenient possible accepting anything that looks remotely like pixmap There also variant the format available setting the RAWBITS option compile time This variant different the following ways The magic number instead The pixel values are stored plain bytes instead ASCII decimal Whitespace not allowed the pixels area and only single character whitespace typically newline allowed after the maxval The files are smaller and many times faster read and write Note that this raw format canonly used for maxvals less than equal you use the ppm library and try write file with larger maxval will automatically fall back the slower but more general plain format SEE ALSO giftoppm gouldtoppm ilbmtoppm imgtoppm mtvtoppm pcxtoppm
