Group not for profit arts technology organization located Austin Texas USA The Robot Group Mission The purpose The Robot Group shall promote excellence and innovation the integration advanced technology with the arts provide forum for interaction between artists and technologists serve non profit umbrella for and secure funding for projects which explore the relationship between arts and technology combat technophobia through educational outreach staging public events and involving youth Robot Group projects defined above The Robot Group Logo The Robot Group shirt You may order shirt

Hours Tuesday Wednesday mail davwils indiana eduNewsgroup newsgroup has been set for this course csci recommended that you post all questions this newsgroup you want know the answer question chances are someone else does too Also you know the answer question someone has posted encourage you post your answer and discuss the possible solutions All this course assumes you are following the guidelines academic honesty Format the Lab For the first nine weeks the lab except for the first lab there will assignment due the beginning each lab The assignment will typically consist both written work and working circuit your logic engine Since the PDP such wiring intensive project will divided into three parts with extended deadlines addition the lab assignments you will given laboratory exam relating the PDP This exam will come the end the semester and will test for practical depth knowledge your circuit Please note that general you will working pairs All written exercises are handed individually and will graded individual work You and your partner will operate all circuits however and will given single grade for your circuitry Because wiring experience will shared your responsibility make sure you understand what wiring your partner has done and make sure that you are doing your fair share You may divide the work however you and your partner prefer but see that one you consistently not doing enough work may arrange the groups Laboratory Grading The lab grade will broken down the following way Lab assignments Working PDP Final exam Lab Info Software Tools

Range Alaska volcano July The use robotic explorers such Dante opens new era field techniques enabling scientists remotely conduct research and exploration Mobile Robot Navigation using Stereo Vision JPL The NASA JSC Mobile Robot Lab recently demonstrated the integration stereo vision system with mobile robot for the purpose following people other robots During following the stereo system constantly feeding updated coordinates the agent being tracked the mobile robot system The mobile robot takes these coordinates goal positions and attempts attain the goal position while avoiding obstacles using its sonar sensors Tracking and Grasping Moving Objects Columbia Coordination between organism sensing modalities and motor control system hallmark intelligent behavior and are pursuing the goal building integrated sensing and actuation system that can operate dynamic opposed static environments The system are building multi sensor system that integrates work real time vision robotic arm control and stable grasping objects Our first attempts this have resulted system that can track and stably grasp moving model train real time Robot Tele operation USC The MERCURY PROJECT allows users tele operate robot arm moving over terrain filled with buried artifacts CCD camera and pneumatic nozzle mounted the robot allow users select viewpoints and direct short bursts compressed air into the terrain Thus users can excavate regions within the sand positioning the arm delivering burst air and viewing the newly cleared region Miscellaneous Robot Demos Speech DECface talking
