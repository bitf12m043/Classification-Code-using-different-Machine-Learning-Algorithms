propositions types correspondence Parenthesization control core General purpose definitions and theorems well fnd Well founded predicate Rank induction lemmas and tactics int Integer inequalities subtypes and induction lemmas for subtypes bool Definitions theorems and tactics for the boolean type and boolean related expressions fun Polymorphic identity and composition functions Lemmas covering properties suchas injectivity and surjectivity int Defines mod floor max and min functions over the integers Lemmas concern basic properties arithmetic functions over integers and induction principles list gen algebra Properties order and equivalence relations and algebraic functions commutativity associativity sets Family classes for types with computable equality and inequality relations groups Family classes for monoids and groups Summations with indices from integer subranges Exponential functions perms perms Introduces the binary relations lists permutation permutation and equivalent list Introduces variety standard list related functions that assume that list elements come from type monoid with decidable equality rings Family classes for rings integral domains and fields Ideals and quotient rings Sums and products mset Finite multisets and finite sets Summation with indices drawn from multisets Defines ADT for free abelian monoids and demonstrates instance this ADT using multisets factor Divisibility theory for monoids with cancellation Develops theorems characterizing when factorizations are unique and derives from these the fundamental theorem arithmetic Last

MisconductAcademic Misconduct and Academic misconduct serious issue university because part the value your degree lies the standards academic honesty and integrity maintained the university Also student you have the right expect that you and other students will graded fairly and thus you and your fellow students have obligation conduct your academic work according University standards The Computer Sciences Department deals with academic misconduct serious manner Academic misconduct encompasses the acts presenting work your own which part whole someone else authorship they classmate tutor etc giving your own work another student misrepresenting your work some other way simple rule thumb not share code for assigned work any form you should not look anyone else code allow someone else look your code addition don discuss program design with someone else the extent that you are actually discussing the code itself This not intended discourage conversations about the assignments the course material However there big difference between talking with somebody about assignment and sharing the code used accomplish also academic misconduct misrepresent your own work any way such handing printout program that does not match the program submitted electronically modifying your output any way except those specified turning output that was not created running your program The usual sanction for academic misconduct for the students involved withdrawn from the course and explanatory letters placed their personal academic files the very least zeros are recorded for the assignment question Cheating distasteful subject consider and instances cheating cause disappointment for those involved something that try hard avoid this end want make clear that will work with you gaining command the course material you are falling behind are having difficulty completing assignment come see your instructor during office hours Also you have any questions about whether particular practice considered misconduct please talk with your instructor about The Dean Students Office has brochure Academic Misconduct Rules and Procedures Guide for Students This brochure will handed out your instructor during the third week class See also the university guidelines for academic misconduct Last Updated Fri Jim Skrentny Coordinator skrentny wisc edu
