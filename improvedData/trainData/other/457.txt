AAAI Presidential Address August Woody Bledsoe Twenty five years ago had dream day dream you will dream shared with many you dreamed special kind computer which had eyes and ears and arms and legs addition its brain did not dream that this new computer friend would means making money for employer help for country though loved country then and still and have objection making money did not even dream such worthy cause helping the poor and handicapped the world using this marvelous new machine dream was filled with the wild excitement seeing machine act like human being least many ways wanted read printed characters page and handwritten script well could see part small camera which would fit glasses with attached earplug which would whisper into ear the names friends and acquaintances met them the street telephone which allowed converse with friend Germany German and English For you see computer friend had the ability recognize faces synthesize voice understand spoken sentences and translate languages and things like that admit that computer person had much larger head than envision for now Because then didn know about microcomputers dream computer person liked walk and play ping pong especially with And liked teach things because could learn dexterity skills well mental concepts And much more When awoke from this day dream found that didn have these things but did have some remarkable computers even then decided then and there quit job and set about spending the rest life helping bring this dream reality Sometimes forget this dream and for these periods life more drab Recently reporter asked why you scientists research answer well certainly not for money though wouldn mind being rich goes deeper yearning have make machines act some fundamental ways like people Period This reminded dream and brightened life again for awhile But you know this not fairy tale want see computer prove hard theorems difficult new theorems mathematics recognize faces diagnose diseases reason analogy learn many ways engage intelligent discourse use common sense play good bridge and tennis etc etc etc amazing how this seemed possible You know this still seems possible now that what really drives course some has happened There buck made now And don mind that fact the economic interest might just push forward part the needed research But believe that not that buck dollar yen Frank Pound Mark Lira Peso that drives the few who can and will really make happen march different drummer and proud part that battalion that responds that music don have explain why had and have this dream just does not require mathematician Engineer Computer Scientist just want the results well almost what want too surprised does not even require that good science though that would probably help not overdone dream Buck Rogers HAL Starwars the Turing test Objects the third kind Jules Verne all piled into one but with all the ridiculous things divided out like breathing vacuum and going faster than the speed light leaving what somehow possible our present knowledge science That what exciting doing the possible And not generous want actually see these things myself before die Pressing science along little bit won cut with unless part the excitement and see some the major milestones The physical parts the proposed computer person seemed important And this still excites now have robot run fall and get act autonomously moving companion well aware that the real problems are those the mind getting computer programs act they reason act they understand think learn plan enjoy hate etc That the challenge the age Some this has happened already and believe that have this room the talent bring about much the rest unfolds during the next years and decades let not fail stop occasionally enjoy smell the roses thrill each new milestone reached When began prepare for this talk wondered what would have say that was worth hearing And was this contemplating that brought mind the above thoughts this dream These are things that are important calling researcher These years have not been totally kind dream Shaky liked shaking more than running and thinking and was laid aside for season language translation sputtered died and was then resurrected facial recognition was pushed back the researcher stack automatic provers showed signs growing pains which disheartened the fainthearted machine stepped forward try the turing test robot arms were duplicating block castles instead playing squash etc etc etc many researchers lost faith and dropped out But curiously remained the fold and why Because these years have also been fruitful and exciting have much proud with much left done First and foremost have learned what are Just small child remains ineffective until taught given knowledge also with our machines Reasoning alone could not have enabled prehistoric man even invent the wheel matter how nimble his brain but the space age woman with her knowledge wheels gears engines computers aerodynamics and the like with the same reasoning power can discover much more Because knowledge king knowledge the key who are Even reasoning itself enhanced knowledge about reasoning and knowledge about what are reasoning about Ours essence the knowledge business Feigenbaum says that are working Knowledge Application Machines But you say Every smart program used solve problem regulate chemical process design bridge etc has key pieces knowledge built into what new about The answer that the scientist engineer recognizes this knowledge for what and has the case expert systems plucked out the program and placed separate knowledge base Not only does the knowledge give the power but provides the functionality The knowledge base acts new and powerful computer language which used the programmer carry out his will defines functionality and causes actions merely changing this knowledge base foremost have learned that must use knowledge the knowledge accumulated mankind over these last few thousand years are achieve these dreams And have accomplished great deal during these last years let mention some But first let express annoyance with some our detractors who criticise researchers for not jumping infinity one leap Somehow them work step step the dream obtaining controlled thermonuclear energy cure for cancer cure for the common cold but such step step process allowed for those trying partially duplicate the intelligent behavior human beings these cynics Natural Language system which converses with restricted form English somehow not legitimate step toward passing the Turing test know case the history science where such naysayers actually helped with new discovery Indeed almost all our accomplishments have been the partial kind natural language processors which handle subset English French etc systems that recognize and synthesize limited forms speech character recognition machines that read only typewritten characters expert systems which perform variety tasks but not all that human can theorem provers that can prove difficult theorems particular area mathematics which can handle the inferencing needed for elementary expert systems including non monotonic reasoning programs that play expert level chess programs that exhibit elementary level learning and reasoning analogy And the list goes Another key thing that have learned and are still learning the list crucial technologies needed continue the pursuit our objectives These partial results mentioned above have helped unearth the roadblocks that stand between where are now and where are trying with are beginning enumerate and classify these enabling technologies Foremost the list the representation and storage knowledge with the added requirement that the particular design will allow Learning ease acquiring and storing the knowledge Performance effectiveness using the stored knowledge perform tasks solve problems and answer questions believe that time build large very large knowledge bases Such knowledge base should contain common sense knowledge well encyclopedic and expert knowledge and structured handle the learning and performance requirements mentioned above effort this sort headed Doug Lenat MCC uses common sense knowledge fundamental way and uses analogy help with knowledge acquisition and problem solving believed that such large structured knowledge base would not only allow the sharing knowledge numerous systems but structured correctly could provide much more robustness and functionality than possible from number distinct smaller has been said that cannot have true machine intelligence until have effective machine learning that case have way But number good researchers are beginning make progress this area Earlier work machine learning tended too ambitious general whereas the recent efforts have had more success where the things being learned are controlled knowledge structures where the machine finds values facets within human supplied framework But even until see some real gain reasonable amplification capacity then some need rethinking the learning and analogy process from scratch This rethinking might also apply for some other areas research Twenty years ago one might have been tempted say that requires only two things build machine which appears think like human being machine learning and natural language understanding Because such machine can taught feeding more and more knowledge from existing books letting bootstrap itself higher and higher levels mental functionality But those two requirements are formidable indeed fact afraid that this characterization misleading lets believe that the major present needs can had through machine learning While that might correct principle for the long run won for the near term must press other areas well machine learning For example the important work speech acts should pushed now and not delayed until the machine can learn from books how carry discourse like Marvin Minsky suggestion that the ability program learn should proportional what already knows Such program when and achieved can exploited dramatic frightening way Causality another important research area our intelligent programs such expert systems begin fail want move from shallow statistical rules toward reasoning from basic principles Several research programs are pushing this direction believe the key here move toward basic principles step time and not basic principles one step For example knowledge actions can classified levels causality will try explain this first giving example one holds object his hand five feet above the ground and releases will Fall toward the ground Fall toward the ground with increasing velocity Fall with its height feet governed the equation with measured seconds Fall according Newton law attraction Same but also accounting for air friction Fall according the laws general relativity For most applications the first answer enough you release will fall For example might say child you drop that rock will hurt your foot This might called the shallow level Deeper levels give information that more and more precise but higher cost human could never get anything done operating continuously the third level let alone the fifth and neither could expert system The early expert systems tended operate the first level causality the shallow level This was fortunate because allowed these programs exhibit great deal expertise for minimum cost Such successes expert systems have been great value the field They not only helped build confidence the researchers that worthwhile accomplishments are possible but also promised financial returns the near term which can help pay for further research and development operating the shallow level not bad all when works The problem comes when that level not adequate when deeper causal reasoning needed And this point that our machines need directed one step deeper the causality chain Using causality properly then does not mean jumping the deepest causal level but rather working down through levels needed believe that the recent work qualitative reasoning correct step this direction But make work properly overall knowledge structure governed partly common sense needed control the process These new Super Expert Systems for the coming decade will absorb large percentage the research and development effort over the next several years and rightfully mean expert systems which have been endowed with large structured knowledge bases ability reason through various causality levels preferring the shallowest but resorting deeper levels needed limited ability learn automatically from experience and accumulate knowledge analogy truth maintenance systems enhanced human interfacing facilitate knowledge acquisition from experts and for ease use etc These super expert systems will evolve into the thinking part opposed the moving and sensory parts our dreamed intelligent machines the future Later versions will have enhanced ability learn learning directly from machine readable text and reason analogy and much more Now let list some the areas that feel will dominate research over the next decade have discussed most these already and now list one more automatic reasoning IMPORTANT RESEARCH AREAS Large Structured Knowledge Bases Knowledge Representation Knowledge Storage Retrieval and Use Expert Systems Technology large Effort Machine Learning Controlled knowledge structures Causality depth levels Human Interfacing Natural Language Processing Speech Recognition and Generation Automatic Reasoning Analogical Reasoning Common Sense Reasoning Default Reasoning have not tried complete this listing and have not even mentioned some important areas such robotics automatic programming and planning Automatic reasoning another area research that becoming increasingly important for number reasons Earlier expert systems required only modest inferencing power because they operated rules the shallowest levels But reach toward deeper causality the reasoning component challenged handle the switching levels and the added complexity the deeper levels this always knowledge plays crucial role Also the emergence logic basis for programming languages PROLOG LOGLISP PARLOG etc and means for storing knowledge Logic data bases logic based rules for expert systems has suddenly placed new load our automatic reasoning programs our provers Thus see the great interest Kilolip machines that perform large number logical inferences per second Such high performance will not only needed for horn clause problems such the use PROLOG but also for reasoning first order logic and even modal logic and higher order logic Thus the renewed interest Automated Theorem Proving will interesting see whether the new concepts for handling Horn clauses and first order logic which are expected produce raw horsepower the Megalip range will enough cope with the load that will imposed the next generation applications whether these methods will have spiced with special reasoning knowledge units for speeding proofs for particular applications any event automatic reasoning research should become more relevant the near future Let not misunderstood General purpose reasoning machines theorem provers alone are not enough Knowledge still the key But the requirements for reasoning about knowledge will intensified and partly satisfied these new high speed provers that are beginning appear have great faith that the community headed generally the right direction About half the new crop graduate students admitted the program Computer Science the University Texas this year selected their preferred field study This preference for seems duplicated throughout the world and are talking about some the very best students These young people hold their hands the future this discipline The power and influence the earlier pioneers will wane these new researchers emerge urge these new students and all new researchers set themselves vision the future and have the courage make major new departures question the old and get with the new There much learn from have pointed generally the right direction but the major gains are yet made personally favor the bold approach over the timid And there are certain bold experiments that have made One such effort was the Mechanical Translation work the early Some have called failure but not had tried seems rather obvious now that you cannot have without language understanding That awareness was made much clearer these earlier experiments they helped focus research the important area Natural Language processing And look how exciting that has become and where has led even the resurgence similar story could told about early speech recognition quality speech recognition not possible without language understanding Early experiments with Perceptrons represent another such example all these cases lot work compensated somewhat for the lack great idea The Shakey robot project SRI another example but that case the value the early work widely appreciated The principle want make this when you have what looks like good idea give your best shot waste little money get some early feedback Don take forever study the problem because that even more expensive and less exciting course this strategy this scientific method requires character the part the researcher she must willing analyze those experiments reformulate theories and press Otherwise that person does not qualify for the work and should not entrusted with research funds was recently reading about Thomas Edison and his team the time they developed successful light bulb started with what thought was good idea and plowed ahead was brash was cocky bragged about what they would build widely usable electric light bulb his early ideas were wrong believe that they were lucky even with all their brilliance could have taken years But this another example like Language Translation where early expensive failure returned information that helped finalize successful solution believe that position today where these kinds bold experiments are needed but not the bold bragging They need conducted men and women with character with wisdom and persistence enough succeed Another concern have the flash the pan researcher the person with limited theory who does trivial application none all gets useful feedback builds program that cannot surprise him any way and leaves others prove and extend his work His fragment had better pretty brilliant anything become More likely real researcher will rediscover the fragment part larger effort and absorb most the credit might recall that most pioneers are well known for what they did not what they theorized What the most important characteristic good researcher Answer does good research Successful people somehow find way succeed others fail course native intelligence important ingredient but alone not enough equally important characteristic the ability and inclination combine theory and experiment again would say young people Set dream Set goal your part bringing about that dream Tool education employment facilities Pursue with vigor and impatience want today never seen content researcher who was worth his salary Don easily deterred those who don have your insight and training Work hard provide momentum don give easily Don spend too much time extolling the work others you will never properly recognized satisfied until you make your own personal contribution Compare and compete These are rules for researcher any field conviction that the field worth your finest efforts have told you about dream have offered advice for young researchers and have offered opinion important areas research But all the predictions that could make the one that most sure about that will again surprised Acknowledgement want thank Doug Lenat Mary Shepherd Clive Dawson Joe Scullion Hassan Ait
