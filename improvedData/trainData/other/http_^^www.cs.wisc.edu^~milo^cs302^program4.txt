Program Due Monday October Objective Give the student practice doing file input and output Program Description You have been hired golf pro the Big Shank country club Big Shank actually consists different hole golf courses each which has separate par score Notes for people unfamiliar with golf the object golf obtain low score possible Your score for each hole the total number shots takes get the golf ball the hole Your score for the entire round the sum your scores for each holes Par for hole generally the score that good golfer would receive that hole and par for the entire course the sum the pars for each individual hole Golfers try get score lower than par for the course For example each hole hole course would have par score par for each hole was then par for the entire course would golfer scored each hole that course the golfer would have score which very good since less than under par fact since say the golfer under par the other hand golfer scored each hole the golfer would have score and would over par which not good Note that You have been assigned work golf tournament being held Big Shank number players are each playing one round each course Thus each player will have different score for each the courses addition each the five hole courses Big Shank has different par score All this data will stored into input file The file will have the following form The first line lists the par score for each the courses Thus par for the first course par for the second and The next lines list the scores for each individual golfer each course The first part each these lines the golfer number which you may assume fits into int You may also assume that each number unique The remaining numbers hold that golfer score for each the courses Thus the first golfer has and has scores and Finally included the file which means that the listing scores now complete When you read instead positive you can assume all the players have been listed there any input data after the you can ignore NOTE The data the actual input files will different than the data given above Thus you may NOT assume anything about the number golfers the par scores for the rounds and Also the input file may have different spacing and line breaks than the one listed above For example the above data could present the input file the following form Note that the data the same the only difference that the spacing and line breaks have changed Your job Determine the score for each golfer that the golfer score relative the par score Scores over par should output with positive numbers scores below par should output with negative numbers and even par score should output Determine the average score for each course and the average par score for all golfers Determine who won the tournament and what the winning score was The winner the tournament that person with the lowest overall score relative par You may assume that there unique lowest score that that there will not multiple winners with the same lowest score Print all this information neatly output file Here how your output file should appear for the sample data given above Player Round Round Round Round Round Final Par Par Average The winner player with score under par The second line which begins with Par lists the par score for each the rounds The following lines list data for each individual golfer First the golfer displayed Next the golfer scores each the courses displayed Finally the golfer overall par score displayed the Final Par column For example the golfer with the scored and rounds respectively Thus these scores are listed the Round columns The sum these scores more than the sum the par scores for the courses Thus displayed for golfer the final par column where means over par The next golfer with scored and the rounds Thus that golfer total score one less than the par score recorded the golfer final par signaling under par The scores for the remaining golfers are then printed out well their final scores and under par The line beginning with Average lists the average total score for each the courses For example since the average and printed the average for Round The remaining averages for the other rounds are printed out Finally the average tournament par score for all golfers printed out The final line displays the the golfer who won well that golfer score relative par Note that receive full credit this assignment you must format your output file exactly the same way the sample above For example each column should characters wide and the averages should displayed with trailing decimal points have provided test input file for you use which called golfin txt You may find the public program directory Please note that may use different input file when testing your program but will have the same name and will formatted the same way golfin txt and the example given above You should also sure make your own input files use test your program well You should name the output file produced your program golfout txt Your solution should use functions where appropriate but you may not use global variables You should check make sure the file was opened correctly You need not any error checking when you read the data from the file except for the following one the input scores smaller than the number holes which course impossible your program should penalize that cheater changing the score that round Your program should print out the following statements the screen Beginning file processing Done with file processing Output file written What Turn Once you have your program working you should use the test file provided golfin txt your input file Then print out copy the golfout txt file your program produces Repeat this for your own test data including the printout Also print out copy the source code and submit electronic copy your source code and executable described the project directions Created Jeremy Stenglein and Dave Zimmerman
