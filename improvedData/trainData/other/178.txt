Department This report compilation several hundred examples context free language and very irregular expressions Contributions were submitted over the past several years numerous computer science graduate students who collected these now immortal words classes and seminars wish express our gratitude the faculty guest lecturers and students who provided the bulk this work This work entirely nonsupported National Science Foundation grant UFQ Computer ScienceGreg Andrews Sep the banker algorithm There are parallel paths confusion through Oct six months people figure out how use their machines until they overused That called enhancement Oct the project tried make painless possible but will painful Oct the midterm All know point exam and McGraw got and beat points Oct This string stack snack shops uhmm snap shots Nov the last page the priority list three take the threeth page Nov Let just throw few distinct partitions memory Nov queuing models not going through all that crud don understand anyway Dec Everything has written down and not head because don know head from hole the wall Sep There are two ways share data The first that you don You either share you don you know what mean you don Nov There nothing profound here and that may true the whole lecture Nov This important but the stuff understand completely irrelevant Sep then there are idiots like myself who try hang Sep The Dining Philosophers interesting problem posed Dijkstra Many interesting problems with practical application were posed Dijkstra Sep show you some syntax and you yuck and that the state the art Sep would sure nice not need another mechanism for every problem Sep This room monitor One person active and everybody else asleep Oct had nice clean solution paper until the referee told wasn legal Oct Gries you sweet rat Nov Student Excuse been little confused lately Andrews Like about years Dec There way can hope get done today suspect dribble over Monday Dec amazing how much you can lecturing when you realize how little there Dec There mistake the notes from the last lecture all but the following line incorrect Becky Bennett Sep The computer getting constipated Corky Cartwright Sep This ambiguous but try resolve the ambiguity with more prose May sort have the minimal knowledge hardware you can have and come out Stanford Sep shouldn even mention keypunches connection with LISP That heresy Sep Can you put obfuscation into words Sep claim that every other possibility impossible Oct that question keep hearing these grunts Oct Let get quickly the handwaving can Sep Computer scientists are accustomed reality that when they are given the opportunity create illusion they won Sep After solve the reliable software problem must solve the reliable lecture problem Sep Programming languages should not subject whimsical variations semantics that depend the mood the person who wrote the compiler Sep Gries Why don you just show the whole slide Corky Can quarrel with God Oct should come with programming languages that don require telephone book describe their little pathologies Nov Outside this expression language APL sucks Nov program comment means for getting from precondition what you want Oct SNOBOL just someone that looks from the outside and grimaces Oct hard say what elegant SNOBOL program Oct This real whiz bang program Oct would consider that obscene programming even SNOBOL Nov Sound like Let get away from and another topic Bob Constable Oct you read the proof Hopcroft and Ullman and you need read after this Jan The only way false can true Mar Let change the theorem one can actually prove Feb Now only have ten minutes left for hard science But that probably enough Feb really kinky semantics that would support the slickest proof rules Mar Student Number doesn make sense Constable Well let write out bigger Mar What going amazing that next time able prove that itself will amazing Apr Let back where believed Apr This syntactic sugar looking terrible syntactic pepper May Stanford gobbled the really good women Feb are experimenting with constructive set theory and may wrong Feb One reason that concept peculiar that mathematics one always deals with extensional objects and thus never discusses them while computer science one rarely deals with extensional objects and thus never discusses them Jan This wealth knowledge will get confused Jan want lift ourselves out the primitive recursive muck Feb the Axiom Choice constructive mathematics has the same status classical math You can worry about Feb Truth and computation are identical Feb don think ever written RAM program Feb Sometimes the empty set causes pause Feb not not algorithm Apr Nothing makes sense the last five minutes Apr Let pictorial proof again Oct are able remove logic completely Nov Student never seen computer that implements the integers Constable Unfortunately they not building them the way they ought May Well looks like today lecture going more confused than normal Dick Conway Feb might have this form Dijkstra damned Sep This unreasonable but been doing that way for long time Sep relational data bases don know anything about the mathematical basis but read many times think can reproduce verbatim Oct JCL always been able find some grad student who has been able understand all this and never had learn any Oct This all done for you mirrors think kind cute Oct RPG shame Oct For anybody else that silly but not for Dijkstra Oct Gries You cheating but still haven figured out how Sep This instantaneous which pretty fast May not chronic dumper IBM but here they need three colors May can quit without telling you about the lunatic fringe Information Retrieval May wouldn want quoted but can cover all the interesting facts hour Sep Don seduced lovely query language Oct Undo abomination Oct Try that your old IMS system Nov Ullman describes fourteen the basic seven Nov COBOL Its procedures are absolutely lousy Nov IMS Protects against small children and honest men Nov reading chapter Ullman you really masochistic ahead Alan Demers Sep The key this that that Feb not good semi colon Mar Student Constants matter the real world Demers Well especially since infinity here Mar Jesus Bald Christ Apr don want sound like avoiding answering your question just want avoid answering your question Apr Jesus How you give talk like this with Reynolds the audience Apr One reason you might want say Why not rather one reason you might want say Why actually reason you say not Sep Let suppose and this big assumption gets asterisk Sep Student Isn that inspired construction Demers When thought was insufferably proud myself for hours Sep Let say what not going the moment Sep After looking that for some time the and the are not the same are they Sep Not only not obvious claim general false Oct That Knuth volume tree Oct the way all you people understand this proof will all but double the number people the world that Oct When comes out that way When Tarjan does comes out that way proof intimidation Oct Let take this whole section the board and write big dubito over Oct The precise definition motivated that bow tie Oct The reason can say that because not true Nov sure wish had snappy comeback Nov commutative ring can whole lot cavalier things Nov not general obvious how but was hoping that would slip Nov This may impossible least hard don know how Nov When divide what get Well get over obviously Nov tape non deterministic Turing machine this umpteen tuple Nov Demers Here the promised Fast Fourier Transform example worked for the two examples tried fairly sure correct Student Proof exhaustive testing Demers Well sure exhausted Nov did not prove correct sat terminal midnight and fiddled with until worked Nov depends something that really don want get into depends honesty Nov just wouldn you any good apply the pumping lemma the doesn stay that long Dec spaces out every time look Dec can write the expression down polynomial space and time fact going write down about three seconds the board here Feb You put handcuffs yourself and try swim the English Channel something Mar Demers Why did switch from call reference call value when switched from procedures functions Donahue don know Demers guess that good answer any Aug don want remove temptation from malicious people want them malicious and then have the pleasure killing them Jan You don solve complete problems your compiler Jan think right linear Feb disaster right Feb The Algol phenomemon little bizarre Apr After Bowen annual spring haircut That really far out don know should deliver eulogy Apr After using both adr and addr abbreviate address are idempotent Apr People who generate self modifying code are state mortal sin Aug the back mind LSI Nov You can lose tenure You can get either Nov Bliss frightening Sep not married but have medical excuse Oct Gee bottoms are getting bigger and bigger Jan explaining this though were well known technique but fact just invented Feb would tremendous help could talk and write the same time Feb There exists alpha such that God Feb are just about the end can bullshit now Feb not Bob Constable here perfectly willing consider functions ordered pairs Feb Can erase this board Obviously just done Mar Demers don say gack lecture all the time Student Yes you and sigh Demers Sigh Mar This language also has garbage commands that guarded commands didn say that John Dennis Mar Chebyshev sure wouldn something false Apr teaching induction freshmen One year one the bachelor professors got girl understand and married her Apr the Remes algorithm not sure gonna math lecture religious experience Apr gonna say this hope true Apr sequences that off hell wheelbarrow Apr that were clear then very offended May guess kind numerical analytic Eichmann the guy says fit with line fit with line Sep just gonna old Texas analysis teacher used say jump and ride till falls Dec Suppose that God someone high government told Jim Donahue Feb The proof took five blackboards the method worthless Feb can fill blackboards great hurry you can fill blackboards very quickly then must interesting Feb Eventually more than just push bottoms around Mar This sort denotational bootcamp Mar After while your mind gets warped enough you tend think these terms Sep Take type now real dumb doing this Jan Why are doing this Because there are some neat theorems proved the end this course Jan You really wouldn want work out the successor Feb don have copy this never even read but gets referenced lot Feb Why using complete lattices Well what was brought Feb turns out that restricting yourself continuous functions great act heroism Feb call this phi and psi again just confusing Feb You can easily show that any space you can imagine buried within infinity somewhere Mar There are infinitely many bottoms around Mar This probably the most influential paper semantics that never been published Mar Admissibility Fixed Point Inductions First Order Logic Typed Theories Igarashi This report about impenetrable its title Mar the time you read the details you should either completely lost completely understand what going Mar haven said anything and said everything Mar Well not going talk about string quartets today Mar probably wanted get the point where could define one side card Apr would like say proven such theorem for Russell but Alan been awfully slow about Apr got plus and times and all that other neat stuff May you spend lot time building the mathematics the model the time you done you tired Oct terminal node not one that about die Oct Its predecessor somewhere off the great beyond Mar Gads this ugly Diane Duke Mar The water being shut off hour you better now forever hold your piece Dec trying very hard make sure that this Christmas tree isn anti semantic May Referring the fact that Becky and Geri had just finished their exams and All the little testies are now overies May Every time Michelle gets drunk have wash her pants May Michelle get your hands off Aug Michelle aren your pants off yet Nov After reading the review Yeoman hope she the reviewer never tries take any courses John Gilbert May Becky Can you guarantee get minus Gilbert What kind arrangement did you have mind David Gries Sep Salton Gerry when was the last time you wrote program Sep Hopefully David Gries from Cornell Oct Conway Half proof might very long but not very helpful Gries Yes and whole proof might wrong Mar Yes Not really Probably there but have think about Nov Gries Could you explain where the term modal comes from Constable Gries Thank you Mar first year students The only reason here and you there that older than you Oct Student the recursive Towers Hanoi program how you prove that you never put disk smaller disk Gries You prove recursion Student You prove recursion Gries Sure you just say recursion Mar Student Could you lower the blinds please Gries Are you sure not brilliance that blinding you Apr Gries dereferencing and ref referencing anti dereferencing Student How about referencing Gries That too simple Sep writing the board can read tell Feb Schneider Which DeWitt are talking about Gries thought was DeWitt around here Jun Research Summary Well didn get much done this year tried but wasn too successful Something always kept from making the significant creative advances wanted make Maybe next year will better but this year was washout don mean offer these excuses but here are some the things that interrupted thinking and kept all those neat ideas from springing out know they somewhere was charge the United Way fund for our department Three cases sexual harassment going both ways were handled position graduate field rep One student hurt his head and was the hospital for week Christmas time Somebody had look after him visited him and read comics him every day Because don really have any opinions own and can therefore called neutral was called mediate the usual political fights between faculty members which all know are ruining our department The heat didn work and the bathroom stunk and the traffic bureau wanted revoke our sticker and student dog bit another student and Eng student failed the colloquium course and one student ate five doughnuts before one colloquium and went student over our quota and student lunch was stolen from the refrigerator Each these called for careful page letter These are only few the incidents that took care did write and prove correct line program January but made the mistake testing our VAX and had error which two weeks searching didn uncover there went one publication out the window guess could have slipped into IPL anyway since editor for but since have tenure already didn feel right doing that did work the four color problem The work Illinois had convinced that you didn have prove your programs correct publish math journals the messier the program the more likelihood acceptance But after week had draw maps with four colors and the secretaries were out the non permanent colored transparency pens and lost interest Every once while would try get something done home but that too was bomb Terak would act couldn write and pen was broken was assistant the assistant coach both baseball and soccer for son team that the only way could get him play regularly had spend lot time Cass Park Then there was boy scouts and those awful camping trips the rain which would lay bed for weeks time with fever and runny nose Something always arose stop from working home top off one evening two weeks ago was working hard home trying creative would have something say this damn report when neighbor dog ate the last our guinea pigs and that began crisis that lasted for days and ruined the few thoughts had Well much for the research summary Maybe next year will better References Ithacating Ithaca Journal Limerick Contest April Finalist Shih Ping Han Sep Worst cases very rarely happen Nov The numerical methods can always produce number but the problem has solution the number will meaningless Feb Safety better than the wrong answer May just found this matrix like fell from the sky Juris Hartmanis Apr Student What are you trying prove Hartmanis don know never know when start Sep Clearly Turing machines obviously Sep have good news and have bad news The good news that not Hopcroft The bad news that Hopcroft will back May polynomial goddamn big function May But that irrelevant just stalling for time May You can brutal things polynomial time Sep Finite means you can stuff box Sep long talk fast wave arms vigorously going good shape Sep easy with arrows But you write iff never know proved the the only Sep even put necktie today not make any mistakes Sep This known today the Sticky Fingers Louie method Oct This may look you like chalk faster than your eye Oct goofed didn yes didn Oct just brutally stuffs the stack Nov choose fat and big that one won make any difference Nov Hopcroft would tell you that this divide and conquer that seems like lots fingers Nov the date the final exam Why don tell you Wednesday and Wednesday tell you lied Nov Any comedian who tried get away with the jokes telling would get booed off the stage People like should not flattered apparent wit Mar very cheap trick which works Oct seminar speaker who unlike himself spoke with accent Will the rest the talk English Feb Student Can you over that again Hartmanis hope still true Mar could have chosen another proof but don know any other proof Oct Gerry Salton going come back and going ask what learned Nov Formalize all the hell out Mathematics Nov can write quintuples high speed Nov really can but Nov Assume you talk Algol for all care Nov Assume you behave like programmer should and

proof Watch man squirm Nov Even chalk refuses write this Nov Now the amusing claim make several Nov brave take the complement the language Feb Perverse means nice Feb could show you scars psychological scars Feb the nonconstructive gaps the gap theorem Ergo Constable can see them Feb That not the only thing can see Mar This department run the model the Austrian empire benevolent despotism moderated incompetence Oct Gary Levin the guy David Gries tries imitate Mar While you being interrupted let just comment Mar The recursion theorem just like tennis Unless you exposed age five you never become world class Jun The books should writing are written John Hopcroft Jun This skinny you see sparse set Jun the polynomial hierarchy collapses there panic some institutions Washington Jun Somebody once asked John Hopcroft about the problem and answered Tuesdays try prove that they are equal the rest the week that they are different believe that has reduced the time try show that they are equal Sunday afternoons Jun strongly suspect that this set complete have not written yet proof because none occurred the correct statement have not written yet proof because none occurred students John Hopcroft Sep About the first pages Aho Hopcroft and Ullman kind leisure reading Oct Everything this class power two Oct have think about not the mood think Oct Not everything say correct correct modulo the little details you going have worry about Sep Somebody should warn when get the end class walking out tend keep talking Nov have floating around which guess haven mentioned today Nov Without loss generality for reason that temporarily eludes Sep One thing like ignore details Sep Two sets half size being approximately Nov Student That means zero the zero zero Hopcroft Observations like that lead believe that you understand what doing Nov suppose none these algorithms are really useful Jan Whenever doesn make sense stop because there good chance wrong Mar After messing proof forgetting how use induction should never things carefully Mar hate leave you for vacation without showing you how prove that problem complete Mar going call that picture proof Apr This obvious educated person Apr have you know spent hours preparing this lecture nobody had better sleep Apr Let sub your favorite complete problem Sep Does everyone see the intuitive idea before get into the details Does anyone want see the details Oct How about proof example Oct Now can prove problems right and left complete Oct Let show you how easy show things space complete Oct can move you win Nov You can cube you don like squaring Oct you mind prime power two Oct have figure out how let interesting things happen Apr the Hopcroft Ullman book can make sense what the book Debbie Joseph Feb Joseph you MIT some point you should try lose the audience Hartmanis you don they feel insulted Daniel Leivant Feb You can grasp infinity easily but how can you grasp sup Mar you have cycle you can spread truth anywhere Frank Luk Sep course not wait until goes infinity Oct The accuracy should not doubted because numerical analysis sends people the moon Oct won give you sketch the proof because the sketch wouldn sketchy Oct The proof this simple that going give Oct seems have transformed difficult problem into impossible one Oct zero strictly less than one Nov not know its sup derivative even harder come Jan Usually course you stop after finite number steps Feb This very vague argument but valid practice Nov You have seen more norms than you want Gerry Salton Feb obviously obvious you Mar Incidently was Aiken last student you can believe that Sep Now what were taught Harvard Mar From where sit and total ignorance sure Sep Business people definition are not smart Sep

this page will tell you what like what don like what cheers and what bores death Want date Drop note and yes photo fine too Find offensive Calm down just remember one gets hurt What Like Like many people like alot things here you Arts not artist but like colorful pictures alot especially like the visual effects rendered different combinations colors Purple and yellow blue and green purple and green purple and white sure got their technical names all wrong they all are simple and generic colors yet they all present their unique character themselves Unfortunately after numerous painting lessons have attended during youth remain the worst painter among clan friend Victor the other hand talented computer artist has his own cyber art gallery that you might want take look favourite picture his the Gold Fish Music not musician either Nor crazy about Tina Turner And course will turn around and run for life when see Michael Jackson But after many won tell you how long just too long years learning piano and gave the end have come appreciate little classical music Almost all later piano years been playing Stephen Heller boring work personally rather prefer the work Schbert have never developped taste for Jazz some them are GREAT but most them just don care for Sure like some pop music too Some best pals formed band called Siren back few years ago not going say how good they are but had tremendous fun going the band practicing sessions Travel have done some serious travelling during youth and have been many exotic places Excluding home country stepped foot the soil more than countries Lucky have seen some the greatest wonders the world such the Giza Pyramids Giza Egypt the Mayan pyramids Chichan Itza Mexico the lost Inca city Machu Piccu near Cuzco Peru the Great Walls China and many more have also the chance visit some the most artistic buidlings the face the earth such the Peter Cathedral Vatican Taj Mahal Agra India and the Opera House Sydney Australia will never forget flying over the mysterious Nazca lines walking for days Nepal from Tibet hour custom check where they have can sardine rayed and mistook plastic Coke bottle missle war head the port Hyfa Isarel favourite city the world Queens Town New Zeland which town wrap tight splendid sceneries Other cities that fascinate includes Kathmandu Nepal Istanbul Turkey Paz Bolivia Jerusalem Isarel for some Palestine for some Jordan don really care and Cairo Egypt What dislike Don get wrong not promote hatred but annoyed behaviour some Irresponsible smokers much hate people smoking can care less they lock themselves home and smoke till lung cancer get them Smokers are generally irresponsible Not only when they are killing themseleves they are also endangering the lifes their neighbours when they smoke public not mention the unpleasant stinky smell they bring about Yes smokers you stink Most smokers are irresponsible also way that most them not dispose their cigarettes properly All they throw them the ground worse still the lawn the bushes they will vapourize themselves These people have concern about someone actually has pick their stinky saliva filled little piece crap one one Only one little perceptive will notice that the majority garbage the ground are cigarettes You don see coke can very often you don see candy wrapper very often but cigarettes are everywhere little experiment conducted over period weeks shows that over garbage see the ground are cigarettes And just don understand why someone would think smokers have style That course not more come maybe after

Information Disk When writing new block file three disk things need updated These are The new block the file that contains the data written The disk block free list The inode file descriptor what order must these operations done able safely recover from system crash Get the disk block from the free list Write the data the block Update the inode Recovering from Crash When operating system crashes often leaves the data that stores the disk inconsistent state inconsistent state mean that file system data structures not correctly describe what should the files directories descriptors and free lists This can happen because takes several disk reads and writes update file its inodes file descriptors and the free list Remember that multiple processes and users can updating their files the same time interval When the operating system rebooted necessary validate that the file system and its data structures are all right figure out how fix them With allocation scheme based block groups and free block bit map such that used DEMOS possible tell after crash block that marked free the bit map should not how not why not you first removed block from the bitmap did the Question then you know that block marked free then should really free block you want double check just make sure that your system was behaving properly you could the following recovery algorithm after the system was rebooted Create new bit map memory that indicates all blocks free all Start the root directory and traverse the file system tree each descriptor record the new bit map which disk blocks are allocated for that descriptor Compare the new bit map the one that disk This will show files that should bit map but are not and files that are the bit map but should not you can see from the last step above can tell which blocks are really free and which are allocated file After crash suppose know that disk block appears both the free list map and file there some action could safely take not want make matters any worse and would like make them better what not why not block occurs both the free list and only one file then usually safe take out the free list and keep the file block somehow appeared multiple files pointed multiple inodes then you have manually try fix the problem Last modified Thu May CDT bart
