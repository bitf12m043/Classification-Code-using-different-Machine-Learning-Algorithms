application virtual reality aid students examination practical and theoretical applications was presented Built based virtual reality unit demonstration students part two member team Grade received May Major Qualifying Project Electrical Engineering Micromouse III The Theseus Project Design and implement sensor system for autonomous robot designed solve maze competition The system was based infra red detectors and shaft encoders determine the position the robot The design had small yet efficient enough reliable Since the project was made six students this was very useful opportunity learn how cooperate group and was aid understanding intercommunication project part six member team Grade received May Major Qualifying Project Computer Science Micromouse III The Theseus Project continuation the above project Continue integrate the different parts the project redesigning the software that was developed Assembly and Extensive testing and debugging the robot was required achieve competitive Micromouse Grade received Fall Masters Engineering Research Optimal Video Transmission This project will improve upon existing prioritization algorithm for bandwidth constrained video transmission The object determine which frames video sequence drop optimize perceptual continuity the received sequence The algorithm will modified take the rate motion into account when prioritizing frames for transmission that frames with more motion are less likely dropped The results would probably published complement the paper already published discussing the optimal frame prioritization extension existing contenious media playback system will also implemented Still ongoing Skills Work Experience Summer Aerated Concrete IndustriesKuwait City KuwaitJunior Engineer
