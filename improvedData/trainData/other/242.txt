surprisingly emotional turmoils are often reflected the verses The Emigrant SoldierWhat soil sand rock did tenderly kiss the holy ground homeland Whose water wine sweetened liquor care lift quench thirsty throat From whom did accept gold silver and that which glitters payment for the crimson stains upon metal Undisturbed save the chilly winds wilderness slept under foreign skies with unknown shrubbery bedding resting place lay unmarked save rusty broken sword The Electric KissIn the darken world digital songs bounded whirling bits zeroes and ones kissed Devoid sensations yet felt your lips upon mine tender moist tinted with the lightest touch passion smelled the scent your fragrant locks and tasted the wetness your mouth Though separated time place and physical laws kissed uncaring unbound enjoying only the moment joining the pleasures nanosecond With sadness and tearful reluctance parted separated Ended the ghost like Electric Kiss DeclarationThe smile your tender lips brightens leaden heart The swirl your soft flowing locks warms like the life giving sun The batting your gentle eyelashes makes steady hand quake The laughter your glittering eyes makes life full joy dear one How love you How fleeting the ticks clock when with you Soft chuckles and heartfelt laughter did enjoy with you What little else can say but love you PrisonerNo rings iron nor ropes hemp bind walls concrete enclose cuffs steel nor pillory wood shackle Yet prisoner Memories our tender kiss muffles voice Thoughts our shared secrets restraints action The door cage unlocked open Yet remained within Yet prisoner Prisoner loving you Three LovesWhat love they asked Which love answered Tell the first they asked cried thought the answer but tears came had dried long ago screamed memories came back but sounds agony issued had silenced long ago Trembling answered The first love like poisoned blade thrust your heart the pale hand loved one slowly twisting uncovered hand from chest and black blood yet flowed trickling down stain the floor walked they asked again What love they asked Which love answered Tell the second they asked lifted leather sack and opened heart beats within surrounded sharp glittering glass shards shook the bag and felt the pain Cursing spit out mouthful scarlet That the second love answered Pain from thousand cuts twisting churning the gentle touch your loved one placed your heart bag broken glass walked they asked again What love they asked Which love answered Tell the third they asked cried tears came but blood streaked Streaked down face screamed but voice cracked throat tightened noose fell knees The beating heart within the sack The sword wound upon chest Nothing Nothing Tell the third they pressed again can gasped There isn VoicesUnder the pale moon chatted with digital shadows Men and women with phantom like voices flowing through web web glass copper tubes Each mask electrons wears Deceitful smiles delight flashed their curious eyes game romantic intrigue they played without tender yielding flesh without gentle kisses red roses without any form golden bands drifted amidst sea banshee sounds Blind and Numb hear the Lake Souls Save save Tell that IMHO the cried and laughed with them Yet the end They are little more than distant voices them Tender the NightTender the night when Luna luminous glow fell upon your lovely face and stars winced bright jealousy Soft the evening breeze that the whispers air send your locks rippling like ocean waves caressed the gentle curves your neck feeling the comforting smoothness your skin Gently kissed your half closed eyelids Embracing you felt our bodies tremble tingling resonance our hearts pounded fearful yet full love delightful joy Tender the night when Luna grew bashful behind the formless clouds and stars twinkled glitters envy Envious ModesWhistling breeze through tattered veils Broken shards light and glued shadows Pale transluscent marble floor Dried droplets blood and tear Wandering did breathless moans lust Tender whispers yearning yet echos Pacing the needle like thoughts Ringing laughters and fleeting smiles Lonely House Two Tattered Veils Three Broken Windows and Four panels Stained Floor And would the one hold you down kiss you hard take your breath away Dark Winds over SethanonWith cynical intelligence and festering passion fought upon the wall grey Sethanon beneath Dark Sun and Dark Moon Each moment hectic exertion Each moment sorrowful introspection Fleetingly fell the sands time the embers hope grew dimmer Howling winds cleaved its chill bone Grimacing steel laced through flesh tasted the bitterness blood Hot salty tears streaking down soul Once you and kissed farewell street devoid others Farewell Kiss Like stringless kite flew caring thoughts you longer able enter your world longer able warm your heart saw the tragedy acted out Neither laughter nor joy the finale Only frozen shards dreams remain that sudden moment understood little the promises that would never that blinking the eye Your face was unfamiliar longer the one had known Snow descended world cold cold that could not love cold that expose every hidden regret You and kissed farewell alley with others letting the wind mock weakness incapable pushing you away You and kissed farewell the chaos night heart waiting anticipating sorrow and despair Buttermilk FallTho brilliant sunlight streamed across face And glittering blue flowed the sky above Dark and shadowy swirled thoughts Tho spring green grass swayed breeze And aqua lotus leaves floated upon the rippling pond Black and grey trembled feelings small tome love poems the gentle reminder that difficult truth Tis better loved and lost then loved all Depression and Desolation mine Dark Shadowy Black and Grey Until thought your gentle face your hazel eyes and dark locks your beautiful carefree smile Slowly gradually almost imperceptiblly the corner lips turned smiled thought you Monologue Broken VersesIn the silence the night troubled the noise the day worried Shards dreams rained upon their sharp points and razor edges bled Why that must ever turn inward face that abyss within alone confronting the demons Why ask why you not hear the laughter within the wind Mocking silly laughters that sends chills spine you not hear the cries within the cackling fire Taunting eerie cries that burns tears sadness screams sorrow Only embers resentment now remain the end only the flame anger and hatred remains burn away the excessive emotional burdens burn away the impurities burn away all but the focus sighed the sands the rocks the azure heavenlies must fight alone the end must pay laughed there joy the sound laughed Musings DemonsIn the twilight broken visions when left arm clots scarlet constant companions are but two Death and Despair Where are tears long wondered Perhaps they fled this cruel mortal shell leaving expressionless What twisted creature within mocks That should laugh and taunt own misery Death and Despair Death and Despair How you been with always false laughter ill constructed joke mocking own screamless torments cannot break your companionships Longing for the end Mayhaps Blood stained white roses Teardrops upon broken granite Lightning gray tempest These are but few favorite things Thunderstorm ISky gray edge edge Thunderous boom resound heavenlies Billiant glare lights above Tear drop rain softly caressed Amidst storm stood awed Stilled Nature mood Thunderstorm IIThrough eye edge steel sky held Sudden flashes ripped blacken clouds Echoed still thunderous clash Chilled rain washed burning tears Impressions Diamond sColored shadows filtered ambient light Neon brilliance stared out cloaked streets Airy curly lazily drifted puffs virulent cigarette smoke Harshly speedily pressingly pounded drums voices and metallic strings Hazel transluscent emerald and scarlet ebbed vessels sense numbing ethanol Notes trembled through walls floors and wavering forms Portraying feverish beating dream Familiar faces lighted inhaled tobacco whispered softly into half deaf ears Why people come such places don know but hey barkeep could you get another one References
