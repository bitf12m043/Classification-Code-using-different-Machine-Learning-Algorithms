Linear Programming Olvi Mangasarian Nick Street and William Wolberg December Two medical applications linear programming are described this paper Specifically linear programming based machine learning techniques are used increase the accuracy and objectivity breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis The first application breast cancer diagnosis utilizes characteristics individual cells obtained from minimally invasive fine needle aspirate discriminate benign from malignant breast lumps This allows accurate diagnosis without the need for surgical biopsy The diagnostic system current operation University Wisconsin Hospitals was trained samples from patients and has had chronological correctness diagnosing subsequent patients The second application recently put into clinical practice method that constructs surface that predicts when breast cancer likely recur patients that have had their cancers excised This gives the physician and the patient better information with which plan treatment and may eliminate the need for prognostic surgical procedure The novel feature the predictive approach the ability handle cases for which cancer has not recurred censored data well cases for which cancer has recurred specific time The prognostic system has expected error months which better than prognosis correctness other available techniques How view this documentDisplay the whole document
