done groups two with different partner than homework Hand one solution per group printed not manuscript The little problems below will get you started with writing Split programs the Measure the LogP parameters for Split Write program that determines the LogP parameters for the various Split remote access primitives You should determine produce table the processor overhead the requesting side the processor overhead the serving side the gap between successive requests the latency for the following Split primitives read int write int get int put int store int Remember always time chunks code loop long enough overcome the granularity and overhead the clock Heat diffusion small Split application Write small Split program that simulates the diffusion heat surface arbitrary shape Display the simulation window Background The dissipation heat object example diffusive process which modeled differential equation which assume the material uniform takes the form where the temperature the object position time this problem set will look one and two dimensional objects wires and plates but the generalization obvious Heat Dissipation wire For infinite wire with initial temperature distribution can shown analytically that the temperature distribution time order discretize the problem first restict ourselves finite length wire say from and divide the wire into sections length The temperature function becomes where will let segment centered and segment centered segment centered will also have finite time steps length convenient notation will write mean the temperature the segment after time steps may approximate the derivatives and then replace the differential equation the finite difference equation which allows immediately generate one time step from the previous one Sequential test Use the above scheme our test problem take and run until holding for all time Compare the results the analytical solution Try workstation for each time varying orders magnitude For example with try Hand plot the analytical solution and your experimental one when and This approximation scheme not stable the numerical solution will not converge the true solution when Explain your experimental results using this fact Sequential program for heat diffusion The generalization the heat transfer formula for problems assuming Write program for your favorite workstation that simulates arbitrary shaped plates fixed grid The easiest you use bitmap editor draw shapes and read that into your program Then allow the user enter hot spot and start simulating Your program should display the progress the simulation using windows Display every time step and allow the user determine Keep the display code simple you not doing this win graphical design contest Make your grid cover area and Parallel heat diffusion Parallelize your heat diffusion code You should somehow divide the grid among the processors and have each processor simulate its subgrid independently You obviously need worry about communicating the boudary regions Also sure choose the grid size and time step wisely that your solution will converge Simulate the following shapes large disk with hot spot the center long skinny rectangle placed the upper part your workspace with hot spot anywhere and barbell with hot spot the center one disk each case measure the Mflops you achieve per processor Also measure the ratio between the busiest and the least busy processor Note that the part you should parallelize the actual computation Don worry about the initialization the windows display that one processor For the timings you probably need turn the display output off display the first and last time step you can see that everything worked fine For and produce snapshots your simulation for the three shapes defined above with and the final time For each shape make sure you use the same grid size time step and for both the sequential and parallel simulation Please provide with the URL web page with the snapshots with enough annotations that know which plot corresponds which case Color printouts are strictly forbidden MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length
