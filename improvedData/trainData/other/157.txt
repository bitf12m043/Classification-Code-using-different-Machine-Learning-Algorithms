Graduate Students Graduating Students Architecture AlumniIndustrial Impact Computer Architecture Research the University Wisconsin Madison updated June This document highlights the industrial impact research Computer Architecture the University Wisconsin since There are four broad areas contributions processor design with emphasis instruction level parallel processor technology cache memory systems iii multiprocessor systems and enabling technologies Processor Technologies One the early contributions instruction level parallel also called ILP processor technology was the development the decoupled architecture concept Developed before the term superscalar was coined decoupled architecture fact superscalar architecture that supports issuing multiple instructions per cycle from sequential instruction stream What now commonly regarded the first commercially available superscalar processor the Astronautics appeared and was developed direct spin off the University Wisconsin research efforts Since the many superscalar processors have used the decoupled architecture principles separate addressing activity from computation activity thereby increasing the amount instruction level parallelism that can exploited Recent processors which follow the decoupled architecture principles include the IBM Power series processors and the Silicon Graphics previously called the Silicon Graphics TFP Another major contribution was the development precise interrupt and register renaming techniques for out order instruction execution Smith and Pleszkun provided the first published work directed specifically implementation precise interrupts This paper laid out the fundamental problems and proposed number solutions and techniques Sohi extended the precise interrupt maintenance mechanisms carry out register renaming and articulated the organization dynamically scheduled superscalar processor using register renaming and having precise interrupts This body research has been fundamental the emergence superscalar processors the The mechanisms proposed researchers are the core many modern superscalar processors including the Motorola the recently announced PowerPC and the upcoming PowerPC Several other soon announced superscalar processors also have the above mechanisms their core Industrially relevant work ILP processors continuing Recent research contributions include novel ways integrating guarded execution into existing instruction sets and new paradigm for exploiting instruction level parallelism This new paradigm called Multiscalar has several inherent properties that make more promising than the existing superscalar and VLIW paradigms for turn the century processor Cache Memory Systems Wisconsin researchers have also had long history contributions the design memory systems particularly caches Anticipating the era when memory bandwidth would severely restrict system performance Goodman showed that caches can used not only reduce average memory latency but also limit peak memory bandwidth requirements focusing temporal rather than spatial locality Wisconsin researchers provided much the motivation for the recent shift from set associative direct mapped caches Smith and Goodman showed circumstances under which direct mapped caches obtain better hit ratios than fully associative caches Hill demonstrated that direct mapped caches can yield better performance than set associative ones despite having larger miss ratios and provided insight into cache design with the model which separates the compulsory capacity and conflict components the miss ratio the area cache design Goodman showed how Static Column DRAMs SCRAMs can used poor man cache providing some the benefits cache memory without using SRAM Hill and Wood participated the first studies multi megabyte cache design which some contemporaries criticized never become practical Sohi showed why processors would have change from using then prevalent blocking caches non blocking caches they became more aggressive exploiting ILP Each one these contributions can found varying extents modern computer systems For example both Sun Microsystems and Compaq have built computers containing SCRAM caches direct mapped caches are now least common set associative ones multi megabyte second level caches are widely used and most recently announced superscalar microprocessors use non blocking caches Multiprocessor Systems multiprocessor systems Goodman published the first paper describing snooping cache coherence protocol Snooping cache protocols enabled the construction shared bus multiprocessors also called symmetric multiprocessors the marketplace Such multiprocessors were one the earliest available general purpose multiprocessor systems and have become the most common form multiprocessing available today Among the earliest snooping cache systems were the Sequent Balance and the Encore Multimax both which were directly influenced the Wisconsin work Some microprocessors such the Motorola have implemented almost exactly the write once protocol described Goodman Recent multiprocessor workstations and servers such those manufactured Sun Microsystems also use snooping cache protocols Goodman and Sohi contributed the IEEE standard Scalable Coherent Interface the first commercial grade directory based coherence scheme Goodman contributed extensively the basic cache coherence protocol and the development options for achieving higher performance Goodman and Sohi were primary contributors the development protocols for large numbers caches kiloprocessor extensions The Convex Exemplar system the first commercial system use the Scalable Coherent Interface but many other systems are currently under development including Unisys and IBM Goodman and Vernon developed the first synchronizing prefetch primitive which was incorporated the SCI standard This technique known QOLB for synchronizing shared memory accesses also inspired software implementations for implementing efficient locks that minimize network traffic during contention particular the QOLB inspired MCS lock has become the standard locking mechanism for shared memory multiprocessors Another synchronization mechanism invented researchers novel technique combine Fetch Increment operations The applicability this technique likely grow more powerful multiprocessors with more aggressive synchronization requirements are built Another area contributions memory consistency models which specify the semantics shared memory Wisconsin researchers were among the first recognize that memory consistency was not synonymous with cache coherence Goodman defined processor consistency that codified the general effect buffering writes Hill showed how weak ordering could viewed sequential consistency the strongest model data race free programs This formalization and subsequent generalizations allow more sophisticated compiler and hardware optimizations than were previously possible The full industrial impact memory consistency models has yet felt however and probably must await the wide deployment out order issue processors non blocking caches and software hardware hybrid coherence solutions Practical research multiprocessors continuing Wisconsin Recent research includes contributions the middle interface below languages and compilers and above system software and hardware For example researchers are developing Tempest novel approach provide support for shared memory message passing and hybrid combinations the two Enabling Technologies The design computer system requires quantitative assessments various design criteria Wisconsin researchers have advanced both theory and practice these important enabling technologies Hill developed new algorithms and software tools that use these algorithms for simultaneously simulating multiple alternative cache organizations Larus developed new techniques and software tools using these techniques for rewriting executables profile programs Wood and Hill advanced the state the art trace sampling techniques which are important techniques the study very large caches Equally important Wisconsin researchers have transferred their new techniques and software tools industry and academia that others can synergistically build the work Tools such cprof dinero tycho qpt have been used more than one thousand other academic and industrial sites researchers have also provided data that industry uses design computers For example designers can download SPEC miss ratio data from our ftp site which would otherwise require four machine years regenerate More recently researchers developed the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel the first effective parallel simulator parallel computers Running Thinking Machines the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel permits efficient evaluation real application performance proposed hardware Current projects Multiscalar Galileo Wisconsin Wind TunnelFaculty James Goodman Mark Hill Gurindar
