traffic control and other operations Two software designers explain what can done make networks more robust Horus flexible Group Communication System Robbert van Renesse Kenneth Birman and Silvano Maffeis Communications the ACM April The emergence process group environments for distributed computing represents promising step towards robustness for mission critical distributed applications Process groups have natural correspondence with data services that have been replicated for availability part coherent cache They can been used support highly available security domains And group mechanisms fit well with emerging generation intelligent network and collaborative work applications Masking the Overhead Protocol Layering Robbert van Renesse Proceedings the ACM SIGCOMM Conference Stanford September Layering protocols has been advocated way dealing with the complexity computer communication has also been criticized for its performance overhead this paper present some insights the design protocols and how these insights can used mask the overhead layering way similar client caching file system With our techniques achieve order magnitude improvement end end message latency the Horus communication framework Over ATM network are able send and deliver messages varying levels semantics about microseconds using protocol stack four layers that were written high level functional language World Wide Failures Werner Vogels Proceedings the ACM SIGOPS European Workshop Connamoran Ireland September The one issue that unites almost all approaches distributed computing the need know whether certain components the system have failed are otherwise unavailable When designing and building systems that will need function global scale failure management will need considered fundamental building block This paper describes the development system independent failure management servcies which allows systems and applications incorporate accurate detection failed processes nodes and networks without the need for making compromises their particular design Framework for Protocol Composition Horus Robbert van Renesse Kenneth Birman Roy Friedman Mark Hayden and David Karr August The Horus system supports communication architecture that treats protocols instances abstract data type This approach encourages developers partition complex protocols into simple microprotocols each which implemented protocol layer Protocol layers can stacked top each other variety ways run time First describe the classes protocols that can supported this way Next present the Horus object model that designed for this technology and the interface between the layers that makes all work then present example layer that implements group membership protocol Next show how given set required properties appropriate stack can constructed look example stack protocols which provides fault tolerant totally ordered communication between group processes The work contributes standard framework for protocol development and experimentation provides high performance implementation the virtual synchrony model and introduces methodology for increasing the robustness the protocol development process Trading Consistency for Availability Distributed Systems Roy Friedman and Ken Birman April This paper shows that two important classes actions non left commuting and strongly non commuting cannot executed concurrent partitions system that provides serializable services This result indicates that there inherent limitation the ability systems provide services consistent manner during network partitions Deciding Partitionable Networks Roy Friedman Idit Keidar Dalia Malki Ken Birman and Danny Dolev November Motivated Chandra and Toueg work study decision protocols model that closely approximates real distributed systems Our results show how the weakest failure detector and associated consensus algorithm can adapted network which omission failures can occur during periods when processes suspect one another faulty For protocols which majority subset the participants can reach decisions behalf the system whole also characterize series stages that necessarily arise during execution Jointly these findings establish direct relationship between extended version the three phase commit protocol which makes progress even when traditional three phase commit would block and the consensus protocol Chandra and Toueg Although not explore the linkage here our results should also applicable other agreement protocols for systems this sort such leader election and dynamic group membership Strong and Weak Virtual Synchrony Horus Roy Friedman and Robbert van Renesse August formal definition strong virtual synchrony capturing the semantics virtual synchrony implemented Horus presented This definition has the nice property that every message delivered within the view which was sent However shown that order implement strong virtual synchrony the application program has block messages during view changes alternative definition called weak virtual synchrony which can implemented without blocking messages then presented This definition still guarantees that messages will delivered within the view which they were sent only that uses slightly weaker notion what the view which message was sent implementation weak virtual synchrony that does not block messages during view changes developed and shown how use system that provides weak virtual synchrony even when strong virtual synchrony actually needed capture additional ordering requirements the definition ordered virtual synchrony presented Finally discussed how extend the definitions order cope with the fact that process can become member more than one group Packing Messages Tool for Boosting the Performance Total Ordering Protocols Roy Friedman and Robbert van Renesse July This paper compares the throughput and latency four protocols that provide total ordering Two these protocols are measured with and without message packing used technique that buffers application messages for short period time before sending them more messages are packed together The main conclusion this comparison that message packing influences the performance total ordering protocols under high load overwhelmingly more than any other optimization that was checked this paper both terms throughput and latency This improved performance attributed the fact that packing messages reduces the header overhead for messages the contention the network and the load the receiving CPUs Using Virtual Synchrony Develop Efficient Fault Tolerant Distributed Shared Memories Roy Friedman March This paper shows how define consistency conditions for distributed shared memories virtually synchronous environments Such definitions allow develop fault tolerant implementations distributed shared memories which during normal execution operations can performed very efficiently and only those operations which take place during configuration change must delayed Three well known consistency conditions namely linearizability sequential consistency and causal memory are redefined for virtually synchronous environments then shown how provide efficient fault tolerant implementations for these definitions Protocol Composition Horus Robbert Van Renesse and Kenneth Birman March Horus communication architecture that treats protocol abstract data type Protocol layers can stacked top each other variety ways run time This paper starts out with describing the many classes protocols that can supported this way Next describe the Horus object model that designed for this technology and the interface between the layers that makes all work then present example layer which implements group membership protocol Then look example stack protocols which provides fault tolerant totally ordered communication between group processes conclude with presenting some remaining challenges our project Horus Flexible Group Communications System Robbert Van Renesse Kenneth Birman Bradford Glade Katie Guo Mark Hayden Takako Hickey Dalia Malki Alex Vaysburd and Werner Vogels March The Horus system offers flexible group communication support for distributed applications extensively layered and highly reconfigurable allowing applications only pay for services they use and for groups with different communication needs coexist single system The approach encourages experimentation with new communication properties and incremental extension the system and enables support variety application oriented interfaces Achieving Critical Reliability With Unreliable Components and Unreliable Glue Mark Hayden and Kenneth Birman March Even the most aggressive quality assurance procedures yield best probabilistic confidence the reliability complex systems Distributed systems because their large numbers components are enormously complex engineering artifacts and hence may appear inherently unreliable despite the best efforts researchers and developers cellular distributed systems architecture offers the hope drastically improving the reliability current technologies settings where reliability critical The approach combines stateful style distributed computing within cells with loosely coupled probabilistic inter cell computing model based probabilistic broadcast primitive give implementation this primitive called pbcast and demonstrate how use implement this methodology Our approach compatible with the use popular distributed computing and reliability technologies while offering considerable isolation against the spread failures among cells Preserving Privacy Network Mobile Computers David Cooper and Kenneth Birman March Even wireless networks create the potential for access information from mobile platforms they pose problem for privacy order retrieve messages users must periodically poll the network The information that the user must give the network could potentially used track that user However the movements the user can also used hide the user location the protocols for sending and retrieving messages are carefully designed have developed replicated memory service which allows users read from memory without revealing which memory locations they are reading Unlike previous protocols our protocol efficient its use computation and bandwidth this paper will show how this protocol can used conjunction with existing privacy preserving protocols allow user mobile computer maintain privacy despite active attacks Incorporating System Resource Information into Flow Control Takako Hickey and Robbert Van Renesse February Upcall based distributed systems have become widespread recent years While upcall based systems provide some obvious advantages experiences with these systems have exposed unanticipated problems unpredictability and inefficiency Incorporating system resources information into flow control essential solving these problems Variants window based flow control suitable for distributed systems are investigated Next message packing which improves network bandwidth usage efficiency and consequently message throughput presented Finally back pressure mechanism which controls admission messages into the system blocking applications high load presented The combination the window mechanism and the back pressure mechanism provides end end management system resources The former manages network resources while the latter manages operating system resources The combination maintains good throughput even under high load Design and Performance Horus Lightweight Group Communications SystemRobbert van Renesse Takako Hickey and Kenneth Birman december The Horus project seeks develop communication system addressing the requirements wide variety distributed applications Horus implements the group communications model providing among others unreliable reliable FIFO causal total group multicasts extensively layered and highly reconfigurable allowing applications only pay for services they use This architecture enables groups with different communication needs coexist single system The approach permits experimentation with new communication properties and incremental extension the system and enables support variety application oriented interfaces Our initial experiments show good performance Support for Complex Multi Media Applications using the Horus system Werner Vogels and Robbert van Renesse December distributed multi media application involves more than just protocols for the dissemination video and audio data any other distributed application protocols are necessary that guarantee the consistency fault tolerance and security shared data objects The Horus system offers framework for buildin complex distributed systems that involve any number protocols well variety protocols for the diffe rent aspects distributed application including some protocols specific multi media applications believe that this integrated approach superior combining different toolkits and illustrate this with detailed example existing video demand application Security Architecture for Fault Tolerant Systems Michael Reiter Kenneth Birman and Robbert Van Renesse June Process groups are common abstraction for fault tolerant computing distributed systems present security architecture that extends the process group into security abstraction Integral parts this architecture are services that securely and fault tolerantly support cryptographic key distribution using novel techniques detail the design and implementation these services and the secure process group abstraction they support also give performance figures for some common group operations Preserving Privacy Network Mobile Computers David Cooper and Kenneth Birman October Even wireless networks create the potential for access information from mobile platforms they pose problem for privacy order retrieve messages users must periodically poll the network The information that the user must give the network could potentially used track that user However the movements the user can also used hide the user location the protocols for sending and retrieving messages are carefully designed this paper will describe set protocols that have developed allow user with mobile computer communicate without compromising privacy Uniform Actions Asynchronous Distributed Systems Dalia Malki Kenneth Birman Aleta Ricciardi and Andre Schiper September develop necessary conditions for the development asynchronous distributed software that will perform uniform actions events that performed any process must performed all processes The paper focuses dynamic uniformity which differs from the classical problems that processes continually leave and join the ongoing computation Here first treat static version the problem lacking joins and then extend the results obtained also include joins Our results demonstrate that contrast Consensus which cannot solved asynchronous systems with even single faulty process dynamic uniformity can solved using failure detection mechanism that makes bounded numbers mistakes Because dynamic uniformity arises systems that maintain safety within primary partition network our paper provides rigorous characterization the framework upon which several existing distributed programming environments are based Understanding Partitions and the Partition Assumption Aleta Ricciardi Andre Schiper and Kenneth Birman June The paper discusses partitions asynchronous message passing systems such systems slow processes and slow links can lead virtual partitions that are indistinguishable from real ones This raises the following question what partition asynchronous system overcome the impossibility detecting crashed processes asynchronous system our system model incorporates failure suspector detect possibly erroneously process failures Based failure suspicions give definition partitions that acccounts for real partitions well virtual ones show that under certain assumptions about the process behavior any incorrect failure suspicion inevitably partitions the system then show how interpret the absence partition assumption Virtually Synchronous Communication Based Weak Failure Suspector Andre Schiper and Aleta Ricciardi April Failure detectors more accurately Failure Suspectors appear fundamental service upon which build fault tolerant distributed applications This paper shows that with very weak semantics that delivers failure and recovery information specific order suffices implement virtually synchronous communication VSC asynchronous system subject process crash failures and network partitions The VSC paradigm particularly useful asynchronous systems and greatly simplifies building fault tolerant applications that mask failures replicating processes suggest three component architecture implement virtually synchronous communication the lowest level the component top component that defines new views and component that reliably multicasts messages within view The issues covered this paper also lead better understanding the various membership service semantics proposed recent literature Process Membership Asynchronous Environments Aleta Ricciardi and Kenneth Birman February The development reliable distributed software simplified the ability assume fail stop failure model discuss the emulation such model asynchronous distributed environment The solution propose called Strong GMP can supported through highly efficient protocol and has been
