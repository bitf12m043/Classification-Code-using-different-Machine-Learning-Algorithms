Learning the Past Tense English Verbs Raymond Mooney and Mary Elaine Califf Journal Artificial Intelligence Research This paper presents method for inducing logic programs from examples that learns new class concepts called first order decision lists defined ordered lists clauses each ending cut The method called FOIDL based FOIL but employs intensional background knowledge and avoids the need for explicit negative examples particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions such learning the past tense English verbs task widely studied the context the symbolic
