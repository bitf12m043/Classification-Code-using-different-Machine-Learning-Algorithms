useful graphics operations including texture mapping volume texture mapping and bump mapping Procedure First you need download several example files this click each the filenames shown below When the text window opens use the save option put the file your own directory Name each file with the same name shown below imageRead net imageRead cfg Image Texmap net Image Texmap cfg Volume net Volume cfg Bump net Bump cfg Texture Mapping The program imageRead net will show you how read image display and find its size Note that image has physical size corresponding its initial resolution world units resolution image world units size the plane with one corner the origin The reduce module lowers the resolution but does not change the size the image you can see from the output the Statistics modules which are configured determine the max and min the coordinates the image Vary the interactor change the image resolution image consists field vectors representing the red green and blue values each point Marking the component colors image allows manipulation the image The program Image Texmap net creats flag image then animates texture mapped parametrically distorted plane Volume Texture Mapping volume texture map see page Watt produces surface color object which function the coordinates the surface The program Volume net gives example two volume textures stripes and noise see Images Bump Mapping Bump mapping attempts give surface more interesting texture varying the normals the surface The procedure causes the lighting model assign different colors patches surface making appear rougher Two bump maps are shown below random perturbation the normals and one that resembles tiles Assignment Construct scene which includes flag your own design waving the wind image from the afs theory courses TexMaps directory backdrop hemispherical mirror which reflects image the flag This wide angle image rendered from viewpoint behind the flag then parametrically deformed into hemisphere The following image one possibility flag reflected mirror which placed behind and below the flag The sky image which has been parametrically warped into cylinder The image the right shows view the scene zoomed out show the sky Design functions produce volume textures simulating wood grain concentric growth rings marble fiberglass The new textures should incorporated into the existing selector list the control panel addition modify the program map the textures sphere and add interactor select between the sphere and the planes The volume textures supplied the program are shown below Starting with the program Bump net design bump maps which resemble Snow covered ground corn field Bricks with mortar prepared demo Your waving flag reflected hemispherical lens The three volume textures The three bump maps You must document your code Layout small groups modules which fit one screen and connect them other groups with transmitters You should use transmitters receivers macros and comments the Notation field each module that you and the grader can understand the program Control panels any should well organized labeled and with the appropriate numeric ranges Back Main Page Lab Last
