project select projet and place page proposal what you want the web The proposal must address the following points title page project description goals plan attack expected kind results how determine sucess failure critical steps get done soon Create subdir vol www Info Courses Current Projects and place the proposal there Name the file Welcome html Here are some ideas that could lead interesting projects Some these are short term self contained projects that could easily accomplished within the context term project Others could eventually expand into publications Meng project you pick problem with wider scope you must sure isolate piece that can adequately addressed within the semester You may work teams two possibly three but there should clearly identifiable role for each member the team especially for three person teams New High bandwidth SeeMe Couple Split Net and Split SolarisMP Build ATM Fast Ethernet gateway using Net level and Net level Implement Net kernel endpoints and run standard over Net Add packet filter SBA firmware Fast Ethernet Implement Active Messages flow control for shared fast ethernet Implement port parallel gdb for Split Splash benchmarks Perfect fast RPC Net implementation urpc from last year Perfect distributed shared memory from last year USIT Instruction Set Design and MeasurementCondition codes not that the question Suggested David Wood Most architectures designed the and employ condition codes Several the recent RISC architectures not yet others For example the MIPS architecture does not have condition codes yet has SET instructions that put the result comparison into general purpose register The has virtual condition code registers which can set either side effect ALU instruction explicitly compare instructions Explore the similarities and differences these two schemes one clearly better than the other Are the differences technology dependent processors become increasingly integrated which scheme will lead the best performance Analyze instruction issue strategies Analyze and compare Scoreboarding Tomasulo algorithm and the scheme Where the beef How much the advantage dynamic scheduling achieved static scheduling and delay slots How the trade offs change with increased processor memory speed ratio Are lock free caches write buffers critical can pull together some good tools that students built Berkeley years ago they didn have much time left study the results though you could leverage their work Address spaces beyond bits According some observers the demand for virtual address space increases the rate bit every years Thus while bit architectures were quite acceptable throughout the and they eventually became too constraining and have almost entirely been replaced this rate have just few more years before bit addresses begin constrain our programs Some architectures have introduced segments extend the address space Some computer architects suggest that only full bit machines integers and addresses will solve the problems Explore the cost performance programming and compatibility issues these approaches Most RISC architectures have already defined bit MIME Version Server CERN Date
