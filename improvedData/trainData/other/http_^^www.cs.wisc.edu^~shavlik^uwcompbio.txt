biology offers wealth research opportunities the University Wisconsin Madison scientists from chemistry computer science genetics mathematics molecular biology plant pathology and other disciplines are applying computational methods various biological problems Some investigations the Department Computer Sciences involve DNA sequencing and analysis experiment management modelling ecological communities protein folding prediction and species identification Cross disciplinary training programs are available for graduate students interested careers computational biology Research groups investigating computational problems biology are three subfields computer science artificial intelligence databases and theory Each group collaborates with various biological laboratories campus summary some the research activities follows The artificial intelligence group working with Professor Jude Shavlik applies machine learning techniques several problems molecular biology Problems under investigation include predicting protein secondary structure distinguishing protein coding and noncoding regions and recognizing promoters splice junctions terminators introns and ribosome binding sites Machine learning methods aid the discovery concepts underlying phenomena through the examination multiple examples For instance system can learn find genes examining many DNA sequences each classified whether not contains gene This technique powerful and potentially very valuable the biological community Currently the primary research focus involves the incorporation existing biological knowledge with computational discovery methods The database group headed Professors Yannis Ioannidis and Miron Livny developing desktop experiment management system that will assist scientists managing their experimental studies The goal the system have single tool controlling the experimentation processes managing the generated data and efficiently processing user requests for data object oriented database system the core the system under development This project proceeds collaboration with several laboratories campus primarily those the Departments Soil Sciences Molecular Biology and Genetics These groups are involved simulation based modelling plant growth microscopic imaging and DNA sequencing respectively The research group led Professor Deborah Joseph applies techniques from theoretical computer science develop algorithms for computational biology applications One research project collaboration with the Wisconsin coli Genome Project leading computational methods that generate accurate alignments overlapping DNA sequences Other work analyzes sequence data for interesting biological features For instance collaboration with group plant pathology one class DNA sequence being used develop quantitative methods for identifying possible biological control organisms ecological communities Some the algorithms developed this project have been implemented the department parallel computers Two training programs offer cross disciplinary training for doctoral students early their graduate programs The NIH funded Biotechnology Training Program was established train scientists and engineers effectively apply interdisciplinary research tools solve problems biotechnological significance This program has students throughout the biological and physical sciences involved research problems specific biotechnological relevance The Applied Mathematics Training Program being established train scientists effectively apply mathematical and computational tools wide range scientific endeavors Although specific mathematical applications students this program can address broad range research problems including many the biological sciences Traineeships both programs can awarded students entering graduate school Training Programs Applied Mathematics Training Program Biotechnology Training Program Amy Kryder kryder wisc edu and Carolyn Allex allex wisc edu are current holders Biotechnology Training fellowships feel free contact them with questions about the program Graduate Study Computer Sciences Electronic Access Wisconsin Papers The Wisconsin department maintains electronic ftp archive technical reports other papers and software The subdirectory machine learning shavlik group contains additional papers Shavlik research group See the file abstracts
