Upson office hours Mon Fri pmWhat WhenLecturesTue Thu Kimball SectionsMon Hollister Tue Comstock Wed Hollister Attending sections required New material will presented that you will need know order complete the homeworks and the projects Attend one section each week Sections will begin the second week classes You may attend any the sections regardless your registration However would helpful you attended the same section each week TutoringThe course TAs will available during regular office hours for extended consulting help Schedule appointment sending email the least hours advance you not schedule appointment you may find the busy and thus unable spend time with you ConsultingConsulting help available Upson The hours have not yet been finalized Consultants will grade your homeworks well answer questions about the computer system programs homework assignments and other things related the content the course help ensure that consulting time used best advantage ask you observe few ground rules When your program doesn work try decipher the error message find the location the error your listing and look the relevant registers and memory before seeing consultant Have current listing your program written good style show the consultant Consultants will not spend time attempting trace uncommented code Plan spend more than minutes the consultant time you need more time then set appointment with the Texts and ReferencesMost the information relevant the course will handed out the form lecture notes You are required buy one textbook which actually manual for the PowerPC and rather cheap recommend the Patterson Hennessy textbook because very good and you will refer many years hence remind you how processors memories caches disks etc work However that book uses different processor and there isn correspondence between lectures and sections the book For this reason not required Some people like sit down read book order learn order find out more and the book works well for that Others like review the lectures using textbook and this book doesn work for that your call RequiredCS lecture notes Available line through the course home page Motorola IBM PowerPC RISC Microprocessor User Manual Motorola catalog MPC IBM catalog MPR UMU Available the bookstore should cheap OptionalPatterson and Hennessy Computer Organization and Design Morgan Kaufmann Available the bookstore expensive but very good Bartee Computer Architecture and Logic Design McGraw Hill Book Company Useful your have difficulties with boolean algebra IBM The PowerPC Architecture Edited May Silha Simpson and Warren Morgan Kaufmann Expensive luxurious not clearly better than the cheap PPC user manual but little more general MetroWerks CodeWarrior academic edition assembler development environment Available for the bookstore case you have PPC and want work home Lecture notes Homeworks Projects Exams and GradesYou will have weekly homework assignments and five two week projects Strong emphasis will placed timely completion the homeworks and projects will use merit demerit system see below encourage this you cannot meet the due date assignment because serious illness other extraordinary circumstances use the merit demerit system catch you really really need exception contact Brian before the assignment deadline for extraordinary extension Primary sourceThe primary source for lecture notes informational handouts and assignments will line the web URL http www cornell edu Info Courses Current will update the line versions errors are discovered assignments need clarification The line system will permit you make annotations lectures and assignments allowing you ask questions and see responses order able reach the line course materials you need sign with the Web page annotation system called CoNote Signing with CoNote what homework all about you should back the course home page and click the course materials link You will asked and password just click cancel and then fill out the form that pops Then you get what looks like nasty error message but fact page that allows you request student access level talk about friendly user interface Simply click the Request Student Access Level button and you almost done Almost because you now get enter the you just chose with the password After all this you should get message that indicates that you now have permission author annotations Hint click File NewWebBrowser Netscape now get new window follow these instructions this way you don loose the instructions from sight You are responsible for checking the line version for changes hours before you hand assignment make change and you didn take into account because you didn check will your problem You are not responsible for changes assignment after you have handed should you hand something early PrerequisitesCS equivalent Students are expected have programming experience using you know another programming language PASCAL you are expected acquire expertise your own will assume familiarity with recursion arrays records pointers linked data structures and stepwise refinement HomeworksHomeworks will handed out thursdays and due the following thursday They will relatively simple and allow you check whether you understood the material presented lecture and section The homeworks will graded the spot the course consultants You will not allowed drop homeworks off you have have them graded the spot The crunch tends come around Thursday you want avoid waiting you should turn your homework early and get extra merits Also sure not miss the consulting hours Answer sheets for all homework assignments will distributed one week after the assignment due These should studied and understood Homework questions have been known reappear examinations ProjectsProjects will handed out tuesdays and due two tuesdays later The second third projects will centered around subset the PowerPC assembly language called PPC the first project you will write small assembler program the second project you will write PPPC machine language simulator the third project you will build PPC CPU three phases phase datapath logicphase datapath implementation control logicfinal all implemented and workingYou will work groups two all the projects exceptions unless there odd number students When working group submit for grading single printout that includes the names both students the group The same grade will given both students Both students are expected equally able answer questions about the program project The projects will graded the spot having you demonstrate them course consultant Sign sheets for these demos will available later ExamsThere will two prelims one and one either not determined yet There final exam Grade computationYour course grade will computed follows first prelim curve second prelim curve homeworks absolute project asm programming absolute project simulator absolute project design parts absolute merits demerits Merits demeritsWe designed the merit demerit system allow you some flexibility turning your assignments Here how works Homeworks projects will accepted calendar days late til sunday for homeworks but each day will result one demerit Homeworks projects will also accepted calendar days early starting monday for homeworks and each day will work off one demerit give you credit for the future Each demerit left the end the course will cost you your grade almost homework any time you reach demerits there goes your grade you will receive harsh ultimatum being time average you earn your grade Extra merits will only affect your grade you are the boundary between two grades guarantees though Merits and demerits are personal group project that late costs each member Grading and RegradesGrades will posted indexed secret number you provide the Web you believe that have made grading error please first discuss the matter with one the course consultants teaching assistants after such discussion appears that mistake has really been made bring the error our attention but later than one week after your assignment has been returned submit problem set program exam for regrading obtain regrade request form from one the consultants from outside Upson Fill out the request form and leave the request along with the assignment question Upson regrade request can cause your grade down Regraded assignments will returned the course consultants Academic IntegrityThe work you submit expected the result your individual effort You are free discuss course material approaches problems and details the system with your colleagues instructors and Computer Services consultants but you should never misrepresent someone else work your own Permissible cooperation should never involve student possessing copy all part another student program other work regardless whether that copy paper computer file hard disk floppy disk The only exception these rules when two students work together submit joint project also the student responsibility protect his her work from unauthorized access For example not discard copies your programs public places Violation the Academic Integrity Code very often results failure the course and permanent notations your Cornell academic records you have any question what constitutes ethical behavior ask the instructor first will not sympathetic

Agenda Vision Since the debut the first usable computer almost half century ago the world has witnessed dramatic improvements computer and communications technologies Whereas breakthroughs computer technology have stimulated the integration digital continuous media such audio and video with computing rapid advances communication technology have made available high bandwidth fiber optic networks modest cost The synergy between the advances computer and communications technologies promises create infrastructure for designing information management systems wide range application domains The functionality and the performance attained most the existing information management systems however are insignificant compared their potential capability believe that the reasons for this limitation stem part from the fact that traditionally researchers and developers have almost exclusively focussed individual aspects system design and application development Consequently very little attention has been devoted towards designing integrated system architecture that can efficiently support modern applications which may involve text audio video images animation etc Attaining breakthrough designing and evaluating such system architectures however will require orchestrating coherent and comprehensive effort that integrates expertise media compression information storage and retrieval database systems high speed networking and systems engineering The main goal the Distributed Multimedia Computing Laboratory facilitate such broadly based research and provide excellent environment for integrating research work various aspects high performance networked multimedia systems Current Research The main research projects currently underway the Distributed Multimedia Computing Laboratory are design and implementation multimedia storage server and development network and transport protocols for digital audio and video Design and implementation multimedia storage servers this project are developing methods for efficient placement and retrieval digital media streams from disk arrays Our placement policies exploit the sequentiality media playback maximize the disk array throughput during retrieval and the inherent redundancy video streams rather than error correcting codes recover from disk failures Our retrieval techniques the other hand exploit the human perceptual tolerance maximize the utilization the server resources The admission control algorithms that have developed make possible provide deterministic statistical and predictive service guarantees clients thereby addressing the heterogeneous quality service requirements clients are currently investigating techniques for efficiently supporting interactive control operations such fast forward and rewind well methods for enhancing the scalability the multimedia servers prototype multimedia storage server that instantiates the results our research being implemented the laboratory Network and transport protocols for digital audio and video this project are developing channel admission procedures bandwidth allocation policies and scheduling disciplines that are optimized for supporting media communication from multimedia servers client sites are investigating the utility employing guaranteed rate scheduling algorithms conjuction with traffic shaping mechanisms for efficient delivery video and audio streams from multimedia server client sites are also investigating feedback based protocols for video communication over high speed networks Finally are developing resource reservation and routing algorithms believe that these algorithms will lay the foundation for addressing the heterogeneity the computing and networking infrastructures well the diversity the quality service requirements clients the multimedia computing infrastructures the future Since believe that many the important and difficult research issues are likely ignored without ambitious implementation plan are currently instantiating our research findings designing and implementing integrated multimedia file system Such prototype implementation will not only validate our system design but will also form
