study which you prepare Software Quality Assurance Plan for organization Option has you preparing review guidelines for some common software review activities Option Software Quality Assurance Plan you elect this option for Exercise you must prepare Software Quality Assurance Plan SQAP for the project described the accompanying case study SureSafe Security Systems Company You should prepare your SQAP following the outline provided IEEE Std The IEEE outline provides that the following sections should include your plan Purpose Reference documents Management Documentation Standards practices conventions and metrics Reviews and audits Test Problem reporting and corrective action Tools techniques and methodologies Code control Media control Supplier control Records collection maintenance and retention Training Risk management Additional information available IEEE Std Guide for Software Quality Assurance Planning December IEEE announced the approval revised standard IEEE Std Guide for Software Quality Assurance Planning which supersedes IEEE Std but will probably not general circulation for few months Although the IEEE format being used you not need have the IEEE standard available order select this option for Exercise most cases the contents document section can prepared following common sense approach software development based good software engineering and sound management practices you need some assistance want see the IEEE standard please contact individually This SQAP must written though will applied real project real company Therefore you may have make assumptions and decisions about what the company going define and implement software quality assurance guessing that well done SQAP for this assignment should require from pages Due dates campus students April Off campus video outreach and NTU Students April Case Study SureSafe Safety Systems CompanyThe company individuals and situations describe this case study are entirely fictional Any similarity existing company organization purely coincidental Company Description SureSafe Safety Systems relatively small company with total employment about people The company located Seattle where all development and manufacturing activities are performed Several wholesale offices are located other major cities The company markets its products independent retail home security product vendors and installers SureSafe was founded Robert Atwood who still participating daily company operations its president Atwood has and degrees electrical engineering Prior founding SureSafe designed intrusion monitoring equipment for major industrial supplier Shortly after Atwood left his former employer hired John Smithson collaborate electrical designs and Gary McMillian provide product design and mechanical engineering support During their first year operation additional personnel were gradually hired supporting roles including office personnel laboratory technician and manufacturing personnel Although capital funding for the start SureSafe was scarce the company has had ten consecutive years profitable operations The company still maintains frills attitude with respect facilities and equipment response continual growth sales and employees major company reorganization occurred Gary McMillian was promoted Manufacturing Manager McMillian beginning think about the possibility retiring During the reorganization John Smithson was promoted Engineering Manager subsequently left the company His replacement was Charles Taylor who joined SureSafe with previous experience the security systems field although had years system design experience and years management experience the electronics industry Taylor consolidated all the staff responsible for software development activities into single organization reporting directly himself search was initiated for person manage this newly formed group The successful candidate was Julie Johnson Julie was selected over number internal and external candidates She initially began her employment with SureSafe direct college hire after completing her BSCS degree the time her hiring there were only seven employees doing software development Today there are Since SureSafe produces equipment destined for consumer use not directly regulated federal state government entities the case for example medical device manufacturers However their equipment does need safe for use consumers and must comply with general product safety requirements and national electrical codes SureSafe became interested the possibility being certified ISO compliant manufacturer They hired consultant review their development and quality assurances practices After one week site evaluation the consultant reported that did not believe that SureSafe had adequately defined development and manufacturing processes ensure successful ISO compliance review indicated that SureSafe personnel appeared generally unaware the requirements for certification and the impact that these requirements might have development practices particular the results the audit indicated that SureSafe had clear well documented product development process and that supporting software development documentation was inconsistent non existent Further findings cast serious doubt the thoroughness with which software was being tested result SureSafe hired another independent consultant draft Software Development Standard for use all software development projects Several current software developers were asked contribute and review the Software Development Standard was developed July the current version the Software Development Standard was approved Taylor Starting New Project While their year history has been successful SureSafe now wishes expand its operations developing easily expandable and customizable unit allow them more cost competitive existing markets and enter additional markets The Marketing group believes that technology has advanced the point that this new product can built and successfully sold improve SureSafe profitability The Marketing group has produced preliminary requirements document which identifies the key product features and market needs The Engineering group has begun the detailed engineering functional specification The rights use software developed another company SoftCraft have been purchased This software provides voice recognition features that are planned for the new products SureSafe will port the SoftCraft code run the processor used the security system The ported code will integrated with some new software being developed SureSafe Extensive reuse code from existing SureSafe products anticipated SureSafe New Products Development group headed Jerry Gibons performing all the electrical and mechanical design for the product New Products Development considers itself have leadership responsibilities for the new generation SureSafe products Three months ago when the project was started management felt that time frame months was realistic because their previous track record computer controlled security systems extensive leveraging from existing systems and also because the voice recognition software purchased from SoftCraft had already been developed thus eliminating major portion the design work However due several significant specification changes and the resulting rework the project now projected two months behind schedule Software and hardware design are underway and prototype hardware unit due completed the engineers within the next two weeks Some the software should ready try the prototype about three weeks attempt keep the project moving fast possible management has instituted bonus plan whereby the project team will monetarily rewarded for meeting future project deadlines this time the following documentation available Marketing Analysis Preliminary Functional Specification Preliminary electronics schematics mechanical assembly drawings software architecture diagram module hierarchy and major data structures source code listings for the SoftCraft programs Marketing now believes that the market window very narrow and pushing for the most expedient development path possible important trade show only weeks away and important that Specialty Medical have working system show potential new clients The Assessment The Manager Martin Adams has openly expressed his concerns that the organization not adequately prepared for meeting all the demands this development project believes that the company may pushing too hard meet the upcoming trade show deadline cutting corners some the design work particularly concerned that faulty system would serious harm the company reputation has heard about your extensive experience the software field and has retained you consultant wants you study the situation and prepare Software Quality Assurance Plan that will effective helping ensure that only high quality products are delivered Option Review Guidelines you elect this option you must prepare comprehensive Review Guidelines for three the following types reviews Software Requirements Reviews Preliminary Design Review architectural design Usability Review Detailed Design Review logic design Code Review Test Design Review Test Case Review User Manual Review review guideline must comprehensive list items check during the review stating point can the information presented class during Sessions and Your guidelines must substantially extend the information presented class sure address the follow Entrance criteria Required items Review issues and points checklist things look for Measurements Exit criteria You can use your own experience help with the expansion but you may also find advantageous consult other sources you want develop guidelines that are tailored your own organization you are welcome provided your results aren considered proprietary Due dates campus students April Off campus video outreach and NTU Students April
