html Last modified Mon Sep GMT Content length Easy steps having your own WWW Page Easy steps having your own WWW Page the UNIX Machines this document will through step step procedure for creating simple WWW Home page the departmental workstations should take you about minutes complete the steps described here The page you create will probably not exactly what you want but going through these instructions will give you general idea what involved creating Web pages and after you understand more how the system works you can back and edit replace Some what said this document isn strictly true you will see when you continue learning about the Web Note The term Home Page has come mean two different things Some people refer page that describes person institution its Home Page Others think Home Page page you create for your own use that contains list links the sites you visit frequently The page you are creating the first type Step What you should have front you Chances are you have probably completed most this step already This document assumes you are logged into the console UNIX workstation the department and that you are running Mosaic for view this page you are using some other browser you aren logged into machine some the instructions below won work and might not make sense and you will have move prepared improvise You will probably want read both this document and the page you are editing the same time make that easier you can create second Mosaic window Keeping mind that you will have put the first window back top continue reading press the New Window button the bottom Mosaic use this other window later addition Mosaic you should have window with shell available because you will typing few commands Finally you should have your favorite text editor fourth window This document doesn assume any HTML specific editor modes you will editing the file directly Make sure you can switch between the windows easily Step Create your public WWW directory you have never put document the Web you will need create your publicly accessible WWW directory your shell execute the following command mkdir public html This directory where you will keep all your Web documents has special place the namespace our Web server this command did not work because you not have public directory you have little more work Please see this note Step Copy the sample home page your shell run the following command common www home sample html public html username html where username your own UNIX login name This file contains WWW home page for you personalize Step Edit the home page file What you accomplish this will depend what editor you use The first few lines the file should look like this HTML HEAD TITLE Felix Home Page TITLE HEAD BODY Don change anything yet Step View the document Mosaic the other Mosaic window you created click the Open button the bottom dialog box with text field and some buttons will appear there anything the text field press the Clear button Now type http www wisc edu username the text field you make mistake the Backspace key should delete the character before the cursor and the Delete key should delete the character after the other Mosaic window there should short list directories and files one which username html Just the string username public html complete path the filesystem pointing the directory you created the string http www wisc edu username complete path full URL that same directory the Web namespace you had wanted load the document directly you could have entered http www wisc edu username username html However the server was nice enough make directory listing for you you can just click the name the file view Step Examine the file The file you are editing written HTML the Hypertext Markup Language are not going into detail about HTML here but there reasonably complete description another document Here over simplified summary HTML markup you read look for examples the file Markup HTML done with Elements and Entities Elements consist tags which are names inside angle brackets TITLE Tag names are not case sensitive Some elements are containers which consist two tags start tag and end tag Start tags and end tags are generally the same except that end tags start with For example FOO start tag FOO its end tag Whatever between the start and end tags inside the container Entities are names that start with and end with that represent characters which cannot normally written ASCII and characters used for markup The only entities you need know right now are for for and amp for Also notice that tabs spaces and newlines separate words but are otherwise interchangeable You can format your HTML document however you want and any combination whitespace characters will not have effect the finished product While there blank line between paragraphs the sample file the tags that cause space included the Mosaic window make HTML document you simply need know the elements and entities and how use them The use entities very simple Whenever you need enter character special markup character into your document instead typing the character itself you type the entity The use elements more complicated for now will just tell you what you need know alter the sample home page There are number tags that get included every document that will not discuss Here will only discuss the Title and the Body Step Edit the title The third line the sample home page looks like this TITLE Felix Home Page TITLE you look the top your Mosaic window where says Document Title you will see that the string the TITLE container displayed there Different browsers use the title different ways The title should short and summarize the contents the document this case you can replace Felix with your own name After you have made the change save the file without exiting your editor and press the Reload button the bottom the other Mosaic window The new title should appear From now whenever you make changes the file you can save your editor and reload into your browser see the result Step Edit the body The body everything between the BODY and BODY tags you look the end the document you will see the BODY tag The body where you put your text entities and most the elements The sample file has number elements you might want use your own home page Don delete sample element until you have left least one example its use the file decided you don want use you look the sample page your editor and Mosaic should become clear what the different elements Mosaic for Different browsers have different interpretations the tags Here list the elements the document and what they Mosaic container that emboldens its contents container that italicizes its contents stands for emphasis container that creates heading separates paragraphs creates bullet list stands for unordered list used specify list items inside list container used make link another document IMG used include picture There are also number elements not included the sample document Here list some them through are like and create headings with progressively smaller fonts like but creates numbered list stands for ordered list makes horizontal rule inserts line break Two the included tags and IMG had attributes The container was used create link another document which was specified the HREF cgi bin finger keeper spacely attribute this case that document script that fingers user keeper spacely and creates document with the result Note that path URL the document starts with When you link from one document another the Web you can refer the new location relative the current one this case could omit the http www wisc edu because both documents are the same server The IMG tag said before used include picture The picture must either bitmap GIF file The SRC attribute used specify the location the picture The filenames bitmaps must end with the extension xbm and GIF filenames must end gif you had GIF file called gif and you wanted include your document you could put the same directory where the document located and use the tag IMG SRC gif The ALT attribute specifies string printed browser cannot display pictures Now that you know what the elements you should figure out what you want say the hard part and then use the tags and text create the look you want Remember that you can preview what you create Mosaic you along saving the document and clicking the Reload button Every night every page that matches the pattern username public html username html mapped into the master list home pages Step Read the other documents You don have read them now but before you more work with HTML the server you should get the complete description how they work particular read the HTML document Using Mosaic test your HTML for correctness can leave your documents looking pretty Mosaic and non sensical other browsers
