PageObject oriented Systems Analysis OSA Tutorial This page tutorial for students Computer Science Software Creation and other individuals wishing learn the OSA model Systems Analysis defined the study specific domain interacting objects for the purpose understanding and documenting their essential characteristics The key words used this definition are Study Understanding Documenting OSA object oriented modelling technique under which the study understanding and documenting system occur The final OSA documents contain the results the study performed and convey the understaning gained the systems analyst This document consists brief description model driven analysis discussion the temporal logic OSA and concludes with summary the different components OSA model instance Model Driven Analysis OSA model driven analysis technique There are three different levels the OSA model hierarchy The Meta Model Model Instance Data Instance The OSA meta model describes valid model instances model instance model specific system such air traffic control system plant nursery database data instance system that contains real world data Examples data instances are the Salt Lake City International Airport Air Traffic Control System and the Cherry Hill Nursery database analogy the OSA model hierarchy the programming language world Data Instance Program Model Instance Compiler Meta Model yacc description Some programming languages such Smalltalk allow the programmer access its meta model Modeling techniques that allow meta model information the model instance level are seamless OSA seamless because the analyst can access meta model level information from model instance Also the OSA meta model can described OSA model instance The power this seamless property will revealed throughout this tutorial Model Driven Analysis Method Driven Analysis OSA model driven that gives meta model for valid OSA models The OSA models turn describe valid system data and behavior OSA does not give step step procedure for analyzing and documenting system Instead allows the analyst create model the system example the difference between model and method the problem finding the way terminal airport People can either ask steward the way specific terminal and receive step step instructions look airport map The steward will tell person down the breezeway turn left the cafeteria down the escalator and then turn right However person misread his ticket and arrived the wrong terminal then will have ask another steward how get the correct terminal contrast person looks the airport map that gives abstract view the airport and reference position with the You Are Here arrow then person will able find his way his terminal misread the ticket can recall his mind where terminal relation terminal and will able find his way Both model driven and method driven analysis techniques have their merits This tutorial will contain hyperlink the method driven approach OSA the future However this tutorial chiefly concerned with the model driven approach and will describe that approach detail Temporal Logic OSA has temporal logic incorporated the data instance level Simply put the data instance can change over time any given time certain object may part the data instance particular model However the object may not have been part the data instance time prior and may not part the data instance time after This reflects the temporal nature data Files operating systems are created used and then deleted Memory programming languages allocated used and then freed Bank customers open checking accounts deposit money take out loans cash checks pay off loans and close accounts Temporal logic necessary part for any modelling technique that attempts model real world systems and data Time OSA defined the set all non negative integers Hence time when the system first begins operating The smallest increment time Anything occuring smaller time increment considered instantaneous the data instance time equal the data instance time then the data instance was not changed during that time increment Components OSA Every model instance OSA consists three component models These are Object Relationship Model ORM Object Behavior Model OBM Object Interaction Model OIM High Level Components The Object Relationship Model describes how different objects and object classes relate one another People have names airplanes have registry numbers husbands are married wives leaves are parts plants and boys scouts earn merit badges All these relationships are binary nature Other relationships involve more than two objects classes person could take trip June flight from Salt Lake International Airport aboard aircraft that leaves MST and arrives Chicago CST Such complex relationships are part nearly every system and the Object Relationship Model allows the analyst keep tabs how objects are related one another The Object Behavior Model allows the analyst construct abstract computation machine called state net that models the behavior objects particular object set state net non deterministic machine that allows multiple threads processed Hence object can have one more states activated any one time thread can change states passing through transitions transition consists trigger and action Common triggers are switch activations key presses mouse clicks receiving message change some conditional value For example when person reaches the age that person becomes teenager This could transition between the child state and the teenager state The trigger would the condition that person age greater than equal When trigger true object can also initiate action associated with particular state transition When key pressed the corresponding action the trigger that character echoed the screen Trigger and actions allow objects able react input and generate output The Object Interaction Model allows the analyst model interaction and communication between objects various classes person can talk another person employee can complain his her boss and client can request service data from server All these interactions can easily modeled the Object Interaction Model interaction between two object sets has name list objects that are sent from the source the destination and another list object returned the sender the receiver its basic form interaction originates action object set state net and influences the triggers another object set state net However can also used general high level communication model order keep track which object sets influence one another Large projects modeled OSA tend become very large and confusing order combat this problem High Level Components have been developed High Level Components abstract arbitrarily large portions information the OSA diagram High Level Components exist for objects object sets relationship sets states transitions and interactions High Level Components are very useful when quick overview system needed when clear understanding the system being modeled can achieved through further abstraction were model kitchen would have such High Level Objects the oven the microwave the refrigerator the sink and the cupboards among other things Within these High Level Objects their parts behaviors and interactions would modeled However would easy see the main parts the kitchen along with their primary functions Server Netscape Communications Date Monday Nov GMT Last modified Wednesday Oct GMT Content length Content type text html Wisconsin Madison Astronomy
