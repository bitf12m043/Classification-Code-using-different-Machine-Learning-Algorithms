they both sign effect Fig withdraw account deposit your account The Transaction Model independent processes each which can fail random communication reliable timeout and retransmission Stable Storage types Storage RAM volatile power failure machine crashes disk survives CPU failures but can lost disk head crashes iii stable storage designed survive any failures Fig Transaction Primitive Begin Transaction Start End Transaction terminate and commit iii Abort Transaction kill and restore old value Read Write Fig Properties Transactions Atomic indivisible from outside Consistent maintain system invariants iii Isolated interference from other concurrent transactions Durable committed changes are permanent atomic append file consistent the law conservation money isolated serializable Fig serial not serialized but since values are consistent illegal Nested Transactions top level transaction fork off children which may execute one more subtransactions when subtransaction commit its results are visible the parent transactions the parent transaction aborted committed subtransaction must undone Implementation how undo intermediate updates Private Workspace give private workspace copy needed Fig Writeahead Log intentions list files are actually modified place before changes record written the write log stable storage which transaction which file block old new values After the log files are changed Fig commit commit record written log abort changes undone rollback The log can also used for recovering from crashes Two Phase Commit Protocol how commit transaction atomically why difficult The General Paradox two generals want agree time attack even though some messengers not get through Impossibility Proof Assume exist shortest sequence msgs The goal commit protocol all the sites agree either commit attack abort not attack transaction Relax the req that the number msgs used commit protocol bounded fixed number msgs Fig SiSh Date Tue Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type

You will lose points you don this Put your answers the questions together separate sheet paper the grading your paper can not easily find your answers you will lose points Homework due the end the class period late homework accepted Grading Policy The two midterms and the final are each the final grade The assignment score the final grade The assignment score the sum the highest assignment scores out the assignments your own work Each student must his her own work considered cheating turn all part someone else work your own You may discuss homework problems with other students but you are not copy anyone else written work code You must not work for another student Penalties for cheating will imposed
