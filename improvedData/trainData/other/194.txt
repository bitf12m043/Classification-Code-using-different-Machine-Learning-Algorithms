Fernandez Valerie Ohm and Amith Yamasani October OverviewRivl language extension Tcl for manipulating images and video sequences comes with set primitives such fade rotate overlay etc The purpose this project extend the set primitives and use them for creating complex transitional effects between two images video sequences DeliverablesA set primitives create transitional effects between two images one image creating sequence intermediate images Effects would include Flip Deform Squish Peel Fold Melt Bounce squish Morph The same transitional effects video sequences MilestonesStudy the implementation Rivl and understand the internal representation images and video sequences Work some the simpler transitional effects such Flip Melt and Peel Get these effects working single image and transition between two images The algorithms will modified work video sequences Implementation the other effects like Fold Squish and Deform work both images and video sequences Test the functions extensively and optimize them for maximum speed time permits Create simple interface accept points two images and use the points references for the morphing one image the other Documentation parts which could done concurrently with the coding and testing Technical OverviewThe effectsFlip This basically shearing operation with fixed line either the two axes The parameters would the position and orientation the fulcrum the image and the angle through which flip the image the case flipping video the frames would processed one one with the angle increasing gradually Melt The image seems melt into liquid and flow down out sight This would involve generating random smooth wave and shearing the image with the wave The wave would also have change shape gradually that doesn look like curtain falling Fold This effect simulates the folding piece paper over and over again How the image folded can determined parameters the function The image can folded opaque piece paper transparent one Peel This real cool effect like peeling off sheet paper placed over another one Even video sequence can peeled off expose another sequence The direction peeling can specified parameter This effect could extended rolling away like scroll Squish Squishing image would cause get compressed with bulge the middle Bounce squish variant this where the squishing little springy This involves shearing the image unevenly applying sine function the shear and gradually increasing the amplitude the sine wave Deform Deforming image would involve squeezing rectangular image into nonrectangular area which could quadrilateral oval First the image would resized both dimensions fit the bounding rectangle the destination shape and then would sheared fit the actual shape most these effects one video sequence gets transformed the next sequence fills the background MIME Version Server CERN Date Tuesday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last Modified Wednesday Oct GMT Inductive Logic
