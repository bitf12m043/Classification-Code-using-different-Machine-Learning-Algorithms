HTMLWritten Kurt Revis modified Steven Fought This document introduction HTML the Hypertext Markup Language The vast majority the documents that you have seen the Web have been written using HTML HTML was intended structural markup language traditional word processor desktop publishing program you indicate how you want the different parts your document look structural publishing system you indicate what the different parts your document are and elsewhere outside the document you indicate how each element should shown user the case HTML each browser decides how will render the HTML elements The original developers HTML wanted browsers developed wide variety systems they kept simple and tried avoid including elements that made assumptions about Web user computer such the ability display pictures The visually oriented tags that are now HTML were simply added into browsers their developers and have since become popular important understand that HTML designed specify the structure the document and not its visual appearance because while you might like for your document show point Times double spaced with inch margins all sides those kinds decisions will made not you but the person reading your document Tags HTML files are just plain text with tags mixed for formatting Tags are used like this Operating Systems Tags usually come pairs called containers that surround pieces text The tags themselves are made the tag name and The first tag called the start tag the text inside Operating Systems called the content and the second tag called the end tag The tag signifies that the content text should displayed header the means that level the largest When viewed the browser Netscape lynx whatever the above line will look like Operating SystemsAlthough most tags work this way some tags don have end tags For example the tag for specifying the beginning paragraph doesn need the end the paragraph will discuss this tag and others later this document Tag names are not case sensitive and are equivalent Some tags may also have optional attributes which modify the interpretation the tag For example the IMG tag which tells the browser display image can have SRC attribute specify the image name ALIGN atttribute specify the alignment compared the surrounding text With attributes tag might used like this IMG SRC gif ALIGN top Structure HTML file All HTML files should follow this general format HTML HEAD TITLE This the title the document TITLE HEAD BODY This the body main text the document BODY HTML The first tag HTML indicates that the contents the file are fact HTML format good idea enclose the whole file HTML HTML although not strictly required right now Although your documents may interpreted correctly browsers currently use this may change the future Each HTML file split into two parts the header marked HEAD HEAD and the body marked BODY BODY All text the file should enclosed within these tags The header specifies information about the document general Usually only used specify the title with TITLE TITLE This title usually displayed the top the screen for example this document title Introduction HTML Note that this does not automatically display the large line the beginning use for that The body where the actual text the document goes Note that HTML character and line spacing are unimportant the example above could have written for example HTML HEAD TITLE This the title the document TITLE HEAD BODY This the body main text the document BODY HTML and gotten the same result Note that there are huge number documents the Web that are not written strict HTML Often the HEAD section will completely missing When Mosaic became popular NCSA documentation which does not stress proper construction was what many people used learn HTML The emphasis was not using HTML correctly but creating documents that looked good Mosaic which very forgiving bad HTML The result that many documents look good Mosaic and bad many other browsers The same holds true for Netscape and MSIE which support and encourage wide variety features outside the HTML spec Paragraphs and Spaces One the problems beginners have with HTML that spaces tabs and newlines known collectively white space are all equivalent type This test This test This test will always shown the browser This test just adding blank line your document will not start new paragraph make paragraph use the tag the beginning the paragraph For example This the first paragraph babbles and never really going anywhere The second paragraph however little more weird has some very short lines for instance There are also other lines that seem forever fact they are rather long extending for more than characters but decidedly finite scope Also contains blank lines the middle itself This HTML rendered This the first paragraph babbles and never really going anywhere The second paragraph however little more weird has some very short lines for instance There are also other lines that seem forever fact they are rather long extending for more than characters but decidedly finite scope Also contains blank lines the middle itself Related are the and tags produces line break without the extra vertical space that puts inserts horizontal rule line extending across the page Section Headings The most common HTML tags are the section headings like the tag used earlier fact there whole range these tags from for top level headings for the bottom These tags tell the browser use different type size indentation color Heading level Heading level Heading level Heading level Heading level Heading level These tags not denote section numbers See Chapter Section but section levels You can course use section level tag more than once document Type Styles HTML allows the use number different type styles The most useful are for adding emphasis like this and STRONG for stronger emphasis Browsers may display the text italics bold characters underlined all capital letters with asterisks around general best use and STRONG since they give good results all browsers you need however you can use which produces italics which produces bold text There also typewriter style like this produced with the tag EntitiesEntities are names that start with and end with that represent characters which cannot normally written ASCII and characters used for markup For example because the angle bracket characters are used tags avoid ambiguities the codes and are used produce and respectively Similarly the ampersand character produced with amp The semicolon the end the code necessary Other codes include quot which produces the double quote character not sure why this code necessary never seen browser get confused the character itself All the characters the ISO Latin set can also expressed CERN provides table the codes For example produce with umlaut the uuml code used Another useful structure the HTML comment produced with and The contents the comment should not displayed the browser However some versions Mosaic are broken and still interpret tags within comments you can comment out tags This unfortunate For example the text This here right here comment should appear This here comment Lists Lists are very useful construct HTML There are three types lists ordered unordered and descriptive Ordered lists produce list numbered items make ordered list use the ordered list and list item tags like this Get two slices bread peanut butter and jelly Spread jelly one side one slice bread Spread peanut butter the other side the other slice Put the sandwich together and eat The result this Get two slices bread peanut butter and jelly Spread jelly one side one slice bread Spread peanut butter the other side the other slice Put the sandwich together and eat you can see the items are automatically numbered order Unordered lists are similar but aren numbered Instead and use and For example Bread two slices Jelly Peanut Butter Descriptive lists are little different they are used when giving lists items and their descriptions like dictionary The tag for descriptive lists predictably and each item has term defined and definition tag The example should make the usage clear This the first term defined This the definition that term piz open pie made typically thinly rolled bread dough spread with spiced mixture tomatoes cheese and ground meat and baked This the first term defined This the definition that term piz open pie made typically thinly rolled bread dough spread with spiced mixture tomatoes cheese and ground meat and baked all the different kinds lists you are not limited short items fact they can long you want and can even have multiple paragraphs This example some really long items list This text can and and for quite some time really You get the idea The next sentence will new paragraph started with Surprising another paragraph with blank space separating from the previous text but still indented correctly This item has nothing with the previous item though Pictures Adding pictures HTML document not difficult The picture itself must GIF format and have filename that ends gif you have file some other format you can make GIF file using utility such the pbm programs include image use the IMG tag The usage little different than the other tags have seen far itself the IMG tag does nothing you must use the SRC attribute the tag specify the name the image Inside the quotes the SRC insert the URL the image example Here picture Felix IMG SRC felix gif Here picture Felix default the text was lined with the bottom the picture using the ALIGN MIDDLE ALIGN TOP attributes you can change this For instance Felix the center all things IMG SRC felix gif ALIGN MIDDLE Felix the center all things Felix IMG SRC felix gif ALIGN TOP top the world Felix top the world Another important attribute that you can add IMG tags ALT browser not capable displaying graphics will instead show any text that you put inside the quotes Lynx text only browser example your page would incomprehensible without the pictures very good idea use this alternative IMG SRC felix gif ALT Felix was quite skier was quite skier Links full explanation how create links between documents beyond the scope this document However can give quick introduction Links sometimes referred anchors are specified with the tag Like the IMG tag does nothing itself The HREF attribute specifies the URL that the link points you click HREF link html here you will see the file link html you click here you will see the file link html you can see the text inside the and tags marked link create link using URL just put the URL the HREF part the anchor For example link and its original HTML source The UWCS home page The HREF http www wisc edu UWCS home page Another attribute for the NAME attribute This attibute specifies that the text within the anchor should associated with name Other links may jump directly that anchor specifying theURL name target For example might surround the heading for Chapter book with the anchor NAME Chapter Chapter Three Then from anywhere else the document could provide link Chapter writing HREF Chapter Jump Chapter Felix had book with the URL http www wisc edu felix book html any document could jump Chapter the book specifying HREF http www wisc edu felix book html Chapter Chapter Felix book Other Tags There are number other tags more and less useful quick survey PRE Preformatted text rendered monospace font Unlike most HTML white space significant Tags are still honored though This style useful for tables information since tabs work LISTING Similar PRE but smaller size Meant for program listings Supposedly embedded tags are ignored BLOCKQUOTE Indented text meant for long quotes from other material ADDRESS Address formatting different browsers give different results Use the code for multiple lines Some other tags are not very useful since one seems know exactly what they should used for DFN Definition CITE Citation CODE HTML codes KBD Keys keyboard like Return SAMP Sample codes VAR Variable names Other Sources Information now you should have good idea what HTML all about and you should able create your own HTML documents you want see more have links other more complete sources information here you might want read some our other documents
