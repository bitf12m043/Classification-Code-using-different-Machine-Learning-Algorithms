and Engineering program for middle school girls designed encourage them study science and math The first EYH conference was held Cornell and involved about girls and their parents Since that time the program has expanded and workshops were offered and nearly girls from all over Tompkins County participated Why EYH The Text The Data The Doonesbury Cartoons How does EYH work From the recruiting brochure What this Expanding Your Horizons Conference about opportunity for girls grades and their parents learn about careers that use mathematics and science You get information straight from the source Come meet women who are doctors engineers computer scientists biologists chemists veterinarians You can ask them questions like your lab you work with other people What was your favorite class high school See for yourself how important mathematics and science classes are What will Hands activities You have chance perform scientific experiments work with computers study barnyard animals and lots other great stuff And what really great that you get choose which workshops you want and our best make Each will have cool science mathematics engineering activities and women who are real scientists engineers mathematicians What get You get fun day filled with great hands science engineering and mathematics activities folder full interesting materials about mathematics engineering and science lunch shirt and science toy What the accompanying adults get There will special workshops for the adults show them how help you explore mathematics science and engineering they have any questions about careers for women mathematics science and engineering there will plenty professional women offer answers The adults will get with you one two workshops and see all the cool stuff you are doing Above all there will plenty coffee for them drink Computer Science Workshop The Computer Science workshop called Image Processing show girls how computers store and manipulate pictures use program called popi manipulate pictures the girls Click here for our handout Image Processing Click here for some manipulated pictures MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text

points This problem appeared slighly different format the Internet Programming Contest Due Date Early bonus Wednesday October midnight Final Due Date Monday October midnight This assignment will provide practice with structs vectors sorting reading from files using getline streams writing classes and iterative enhancement Table Contents Introduction Input Output Coding Grading Submitting Extra Credit Makefile and sample input files are accessible ola cps kwic the acpub system sure create subdirectory kwic for this problem and set the permissions for access prof uta typing setacl kwic ola cps read Introduction Searching and sorting are prototypical computer applications For this assignment you write program that organizes titles sentences for efficient human search based different key words Given list titles and list words ignore you are write program that generates KWIC Key Word Context index the titles KWIC index title listed once for each keyword that occurs the title The KWIC index alphabetized keyword Keywords are any words that are not listed the list words ignore For example words ignore are the and and the list titles Descent Man The Ascent Man The Old Man and The Sea Portrait The Artist Young Man KWIC index these titles given portrait the ARTIST young man the ASCENT man DESCENT man descent MAN the ascent MAN the old MAN and the sea portrait the artist young MAN the OLD man and the sea PORTRAIT the artist young man the old man and the SEA portrait the artist YOUNG man Each title listed many times there are key words the title For example Portrait the Artist Young Man listed four times once each for portrait artist young and man Input Output Your program should read from file whose name you enter when you run the program Legal input files contain list words ignore one per line followed list titles one per line The string line itself used separate the list words ignore from the list titles Each the words ignore appears lower case letters line itself and more than characters length Each title appears line itself and may consist mixed case upper and lower letters Words title are separated whitespace title contains more than words There will more than words ignore more than than titles and more than characters the titles and words ignore combined characters other than and white space will appear the input The Output The output should KWIC index the titles with each title appearing once for each keyword the title and with the KWIC index alphabetized keyword word appears more than once title each instance potential keyword other words the title Rose Rose Aphorism would appear three times once for each occurrence Rose and once for Aphorism The keyword should appear all upper case letters All other words title should lower case letters Case upper lower irrelevant when determining word ignored Titles should roughly centered shown above with all key words capitalized and justified somewhere near the middle column screen don worry about this part first Assume titles will fit line don worry about handling weird cases just handle cases assuming that the longest title will fit properly Titles the KWIC index with the same keyword should appear the same order they appeared the input file the case where multiple instances word are keywords the same title the keywords should capitalized left right order sort that maintains the original order elements with equal keys called stable sort Insertion sort stable The code for insertion sort can found the Tapestry text reproduced below for vector ints void InsertSort Vector int numElts precondition contains numElts ints postcondition elements are sorted non decreasing order int loc int hold for Sample Input the and but Descent Man The Ascent Man The Old Man and The Sea Portrait The Artist Young Man Man Man but Bubblesort DOG Corresponding Output portrait the ARTIST young man the ASCENT man man man but BUBBLESORT dog DESCENT man man man but bubblesort DOG descent MAN the ascent MAN the old MAN and the sea portrait the artist young MAN MAN man but bubblesort dog man MAN but bubblesort dog the OLD man and the sea PORTRAIT the artist young man the old man and the SEA portrait the artist YOUNG man Coding Requirements and Help Ideally you will maintain only one copy each title you will not store title once for each keyword although you will print title once for each keyword You may choose not worry about this This assignment worth points and the points are for minimizing storage storing titles only once first pass you may decide store each title once for each occurrence keyword That might lead the following declarations diagram below shows how the struct KwicTitle used store the title The Old Man and the Sea struct KwicTitle Vector myTitle int myKeyIndex bool operator the diagram below the title stored KwicTitle objects once for each keyword Note that when two two KwicTitles are compared using less than operator the index the keyword determines which string the KwicTitles are compared you may need think about this Minimizing Storage One option for storing titles once use vector titles storing each title once the vector course the titles may vectors strings but this isn problem you can also make the titles structs that contain vector strings Then you can replace myTitle the declaration KwicTitle with index into the vector titles With this solution there will still four KwicTitle objects for The Sun Also Rises but myTitle now index title rather than title again think about this carefully and ask questions Developing Class You probably find useful develop class solve this problem For example public member functions could include Read and PrintIndex There will probably several private member functions that will called from PrintIndex and that will call each other For example you might store the words ignore Vector string myIgnore and then write function shown below search this vector bool Kwic IsIgnore const string int for course you don need this just example private member function Kwic IsIgnore that could useful Grading Standards This assignment worth points Points will awarded follows Behavior Points Generates KWIC index Sorted Properly Handles duplicate key words title Nice output centered Memory Efficient Coding Style uses classes comments README Submission You should create README file for this and all assignments All README files should include your name well the name anyone with whom you collaborated the assignment and the amount time you spent submit your assignment type submit kwic README kwic Makefile sure submit all source files you may decide write seperate header file although this NOT required Extra Credit For extra credit you should not use vector store the words title you should use List see chapter Tapestry You can still use index for each keyword but you need count words rather than index directly the keyword because the list class doesn support random access You are free change KwicTitle completely but you must minimize storage and you must use Lists store any titles submit the extra credit assignment type submit kwic xtra README where you include all the files you use for this version the kwic program Date Mon Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Mon Aug GMT Content length Assignments for Assignments for dec There will assignment every
