Content Length Last Modified Monday Oct GMT Program Interactive Hierarchical Modeling using Mesa Program Interactive Hierarchical Modeling using Mesa Due November You are create industrial style robot arm similar that the picture above and user interface which can used interactively control the arm You should also create cube that can picked the arm when both fingers the arm are touching opposite faces the cube You will create the robot arm hierarchical model based only few simple base primitives perhaps only cylinder You will use Mesa control the viewing camera parameters and the lighting and material properties the robot The robot should rendered set opaque closed objects your primitives will consist filled surfaces and you will use back face culling and buffer based hidden surface removal for display Your lighting should designed carefully make the three dimensional shape the robot clear You must use least lambertian flat shading for the surfaces you may choose add smooth shading and specular lighting well but not overdo the lighting the expense interaction speed The number light sources used also your choice Your model should structured along the lines the picture and should have the degrees freedom indicated Cylinder should rotate about the common axis shares with the base The rest the arm should rotate with should fixed with respect except that too can rotate about its axis should fixed with respect should able translate along the common axis shares with and also rotate about its axis should fixed with respect and and should pivot about the ends they can used grasp things Both the base the robot and the movable cube will initially sit common table plane The cube should positioned randomly within the reach the arm The user interface your program should have mode which the mouse can used move the viewing position with respect the world containing the robot arm and cube You should also have mode for controlling the arm arm control mode when the left mouse button pressed sideways motion the mouse should rotate and forward and back rotation the mouse should rotate When the middle button held sideways mouse motion should rotate and back and forth motion should translate The left and right arrow keys should always open and close the fingers The right mouse button should exit the mode bring menu viewing mode when the left mouse button held down sidways mouse motion should move the observer longitudinally about imaginary sphere centered the robot arm and back and forth motion should move the view latitudinally With the middle mouse button down mouse motions should lengthen and shorten the radius the imaginary sphere The right button should behave arm control mode You should also able reset the robot arm its initial configuration Your user interface should implemented using GLUT the toolkit included for this purpose with our Mesa installation You can get head start this project looking pages the OpenGL Programmer Guide and the GLUT Walker demo src Mesa GLUT progs demos walker this src Mesa progs demos walker the lab Good luck and have fun Server Netscape Enterprise Date Tue Jan GMT Accept ranges bytes Last modified Mon May GMT

dimensional equations for Boussinesq convection The initial conditions for this computation were taken from paper and Shu and consist smooth bubble density zero flow field the bubble begins rise strong fronts the density field form shown the contour lines the figure and vorticity baroclinically produced along this front shown the color shading the numerical method begins under resolve the flow the density front destabilizes and rolls under the influence the vorticity Because the experience gained from studying the appearance spurious vortices under resolved flows the correctness the front roll questionable despite the fact that consistent with the evolution the bubble order investigate this problem further have developed adaptive mesh refinement techniques for the Boussinesq equations Below example simulation using initial conditions from the paper Siggia and Pumir Impact Besides providing excellent test problem for the development improvement and evaluation adaptive mesh refinement methods for incompressible flow hope also shed some light the open and sometimes controversal question whether not the two dimensional Boussinesq equations admit finite time singularities
