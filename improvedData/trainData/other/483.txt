get together fellowship encourage and support each other The activities the fellowship help Christians grow our spiritual life Another function share the Gospel with students who have not yet received Christ What activities you have have prayer Bible study talks special topics dinner singing hymns discipleship evangelism and small group activities When and where you meet usually meet from Friday evenings WEL WEL the Rober Welch Hall Speedway and Street Sometimes have special arrange ments Please refer our schedule What Does Mean Christian Christians are those who have given their life over Jesus Christ One way describing what Christians their basis doctrine life and obedience Christian basis authority God word the Bible Our Basic Beliefs There and will forever only One True God inseparable almighty all knowing good eternally self existing three distinct Persons the Father Son and Holy Spirit God loving kind merciful righteous stern holy and sovereign just and trustworthy The sixty six books the Bible are the inspired Word God without error the original manuscripts authoritative trustworthy and complete precious and try understand live and obey Jesus and the Biblical writers meant God both created and sustains all creatures angels demons and all the universe for His glory People are and will not God but all people are made God image Since the fall people are sinful before God All the earth was good but since the fall imperfect and now under Satan control Jesus was born the Virgin Mary and fully man and fully God came earth die atoning sacrifice for our sins completely save and purify from all unrighteousness was bodily raised from the dead There other way heaven except through God only begotten Son Jesus Christ will personally return power and glory the second coming After death believers conscious eternal bliss with God heaven and then the new heaven and earth Unbelievers conscious eternal torment away from God hell and then the Lake Fire Our Basic Experience Some converted Christianity from other backgrounds others were raised Christian families Regardless all Christians have repented their sins believed God and asked God come into their life their Lord longer live only for ourselves but everything work play and study our best glorify God longer live ourselves but the Holy Spirit dwells all believers rely God and not ourselves not only for His free gift salvation but also for preserving and transforming His Holy Spirit must examine ourselves though for counterfeit Christians can deceived While are declared righteous God still sin while earth and the Holy Spirit sanctifying that can live sinlessly heaven Our Christian life centered around God and involves nurtured God word fellowship and loving others evangelism mission and discipling and worship and prayer While study work play help people others this things live lives pleasing God trusting God rather than ourselves and enjoying being God love Obedient Christians may still times down disappointed suffering persecuted but God never ceases love deeply there strengthening and renewing also love one another deeply both joyful celebration and helping others through hard times Our Basic Practice all things true Christians strive please our Lord strive obey the greatest commandment and love our Lord with all are worship none except the True God not engage the occult superstition idols give religious worship any others must not worship through graven images Since fully love God and are devoted Him spend time reading His word meditating Him praying and worshipping Him strive obey God command holy and Christlike strive have integrity our whole life not defraud hurt others not cheat are Temples the Holy Spirit and honor God with our bodies not getting drunk high drugs abusing our bodies turn away from worldly passions material extravagance and selfish ambition give God our lives money and time strive obey God command love others ourselves are kind towards all but especially towards those need Rather than being proud regard others needs greater equal our own not want hurt others physically gossip slander stumbling others lack love honor our parents governments and obey all laws that not conflict with God laws work together with other Christians ours and other fellowships share the gospel nurture exhort and encourage believers oppose evil and guard against error and general salt and light this world Last updated Dec Mail comments questions suggestions ideas acccf www utexas edu ACCCF registered student organization the University Texas
