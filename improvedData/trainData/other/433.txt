the spring felt compelled some real digging and building opposed digging bugs and building vaporware The house and garden offered plenty opportunities for such entertainment and had decide where start with remodeling had been bothered the noise from the road passing front the house while sitting our covered porch for while fixing that seemed like good idea decided build solid fence screen the porch from the cars and place retaining wall extending the down hill wall the house the property line This would form level patio around the porch which wanted landscape japanese style started drawing plans buying wood and then digging During some evening after sweaty day digging sawing and hammering looked into one too many gardening books and got bitten the pond bug The perspective having nice surface water with beautiful water plants right there front our porch sounded just too wonderful then occurred that could relatively easily adapt the construction create pond only needed dig bit deeper thought Well turned out little more involved than that First had reinforce the whole construction bit make sure would not yield under the weight the water And then the whole process lining the pond took lot more time than filling the hole behind the retaining wall with dirt would have had the wise idea take couple pictures during the constrution which making available here You might wonder why this Well very simply because found Pete Pond Page very inspiring and helpful while planning the construction own pond hope that others get inspired seeing pond and find helpful see how someone else did things Pond construction The pages below are available two forms with inline images JPEG and GIF formats JPEGs are smaller but some browsers only support inline GIFs You choose Wood construction
