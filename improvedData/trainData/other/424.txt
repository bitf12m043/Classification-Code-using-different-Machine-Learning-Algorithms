Introduction This project aims implement sampling resolution independent digital audio engineering tool that can used create moderately complex special effects The project should sport easy use and fairly portable interface across various Unix platforms The program should work reasonably well all kinds audio samples from low fidelity voice quality music Ideally this program should able utilize commonly available hardware features such mono stereo audio playback and recording DeliverablesWorking software Technical documentationMilestonesAlgorithms research Hardware support and standards research User interface Tcl and Time domain functions Frequency domain related mathematics research Frequency domain functions General OperationsPlayback The program should able playback the samples being edited for previewing purposes This function does not aim interface with device capable production quality audio synthesis Pause The program should able stop the middle playback Rewind The program should able return certain sample earlier time and resume playback from there Fast Forward The program should able skip ahead certain sample later time and resume playback from there Seek The program should able start playback any certain sample the entire sound file indexed either playing time seconds sample number Record Optional hardware support permits this program should able digitize samples from external audio source general however this program should assume that samples are digitized another dedicated platform because quality considerations Volume Control This program should have the ability adjust the output volume the playback function appropriately possible decibel notation should employed instead arbitrary volume levels such Balance Optional This program should able adjust the ratio between playback output the left and right channels stereo hardware File Operations Optional Currently the Sun Audio Format deemed most appropriate for reasons portability and ease programming time permits support should provided output resulting samples the Microsoft Windows Wave WAV format Creative Labs Voice VOC format and others Monitors The following functions not alter the input samples any way but display them manner that might visually useful and pretty the audio engineer Raw Waveform The program should able display the pulse code modulation PCM format digitized samples waveform time domain Multiple files can open the same time allow simple edit operations such Cut Copy Paste and some others that users commercial software would come expect Spectrum The program should display frequency spectrum synchronized with the playback show the distribution frequencies Right now are split between the conventional boombox style discrete frequency ranges and quantized intensity levels dancing LED bars more scientific high resolution spectrum display possible only video monitors Suggestions are welcome Time Frequency Amplitude Histogram The program should display time domain frequency amplitude graph such that time progresses along the axis towards the right side frequency ranges are plotted along the axis and out and amplitude plotted along the axis going This display would useful visualizing amplitude distributions over time Time Domain Operations These functions modify the input waveform the time domain and not require Fast Fourier Transform FFT its inverse operate All time domain operations can performed the entire file some selected subset These operations should resolution independent Echo This function digitally simulates echo will implemented mixing several copies the sample decreasing strength with corresponding shift time Fade These two function incrementally increase decrease volume over range time Mix This function the digital simulation mixing two input sources together and will implemented with some form weighted averaging the samples Backmasking This function reverses the waveform time such that the last input will become the first input and vice versa This function useful including Satanic messages into rock songs advocating suicide Silence This function creates range silence Amplitude Scaling This function used modify the amplitude range samples effect increase decrease volume Resampling This function allows input waveform upsampled higher sampling frequency downsampled lower Upsampling probably accomplished interpolation and downsampling tossing away samples Frequency Domain Operations The following operations require processing the frequency domain Pitch Scaling This function can used effect pitch shifting without affecting playback speed useful making people talk like chipmunks Graphic Equalizer This function can used enhance inhibit certain frequency ranges for example reduce noise Two proposals are being reviewed here the first being the traditional boombox graphic equalizer with sliders free form tool that will automatically curve fit certain selected points and modify the spectrum accordingly Suggestions welcome Addition and Subtraction This function allows the addition subtraction spectrum with another This possibly useful noise elimination Morphing This function can used transform one spectrum into another incrementally over time Last updated December Maintained Steven Janet MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content
