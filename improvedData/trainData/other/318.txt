interfaces and implementations dense and sparse parallel linear algebra libraries This project unique that concentrates convenient interfaces our conclusion that this can only achieved distributing the vectors linear system first which then induces the matrix distribution Justification for this lies the fact that the physical problem leads mathematical model involving two spaces and operator these spaces that represent the problem Discretization the mathematical model leads vectors which hold the solution and right hand side and the matrix which the discretized operator Physically Based Matrix Distribution based these ideas The interface that allows information from the physical problem and mathematical model passed down the library called the Physically Distributed Matrix Interface

Consider the following array integers Write down the array after each iteration recursive call Quicksort Merge Sort Taken from Data Structures Using Tanenbaum sort counting performed follows Declare and array count and set count the number elements that are less than Then place position count output array However beware the possibilities equal elements Write routine sort array size using this method Write program test your routine Extra credit Implement the Quicksort algorithm for two way linked lists About this document Alberto Oliart Sat Apr EDT Date Tue Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type

suggestions for this list please send email skrentny wisc edu These common errors are ordered into the following categories BasicsControl StructuresBasic Data StructuresFunctionsC Basicscase isn CASE isn CaSeC case sensitive Different capitalizations can used make different identifiers The convention that follow uses ALLCAPS for constants Initial Cap for type names and lower case for variable names typedef float Case const Case CASE Case case CASE dividing divisionAny time both operands the division are integral types integers the operation becomes whole number division rather than fractional division You must change one the operands using type casting real number float double get fractional division The code below displays int float cout something true and nothing falseAny nonzero value means logical true whereas only false Our compiler provides the bool type and the values true and false for booleans Since this now supported preferred use this type rather than enumerated boolean type shown the text the integers and For simple example see bool you use enumerated type include boolean shown the text you may get compiler warning message that can ignored inner cities may have inadvertent localsVariables are created when they are defined and destroyed when they fall out scope There are many places where variables can defined and unintentionally within code block that limits the variables scope int cout leading with zeros can confusingNumbers with least one leading zeros are treated octal base not decimal base The code below displays int cout not Character values are enclosed single quotes whereas strings are enclosed double quotes and are terminated with NULL character The code below should give syntax error but may not Control Structuresif only where but they are not equalProbably the most common error using assignment rather than equality Since assignment often legal where equality comparison desired this error may not create syntax error you ever use assignment where equality would expected comment your code say the assignment was intentional apples oranges OOPS this intentional and are and and but not and Like equality comparisons logical and and logical must use the appropriate symbol doubled with space between greatest greater greatWhen sequence comparisons are made you can only compare two things time and must join the comparisons using logical and The conditions below may look good but evaluate false should should compounding the problemOnly single statement follows the body most control structures unless you compound the statements using statement block good practice always use apples oranges cout break not breakA break statement must follow every case switch statement unless you intend flow through the next case good practice even put break after the last case switch menu choice case intentional flow through next case case add item accidental flow through next case case intentional flow through next case case delete item break good practice the bodyless loopA misplaced semicolon can behead loop the examples below the loops have NULL body due the extra semicolon and the compiler won complain for scoping for countersThe scoping rules for for loops have changed the new ANSI rules This generating many warning messages for programs that mix old and new styles and sometimes results syntax errors For more detail see code example recommend the following eliminate problems Loop counters that are used outside the loop body are defined outside the loop int for Loop counters that are used only inside the loop body can defined the for loop the manner shown below defines TWO local counters that are used only inside loop for int Using the old style defining two loop counters may give syntax errors and should avoided notice the second int below vvv for int int Basic Data Structuresstart indexing Array indices always begin The example below creates array with elements with the first index and the last index int ERROR last index your out boundsThere nothing prevent your from indexing beyond the bounds array except perhaps that your program may misbehave intermittently even crash Unfortunately the compiler doesn verify that your indices are range programs will compile with bad indices like being out your elementElements multidimensional arrays are accessed However legal The comma operator that evaluates each operand and results the value the right hand operand This means the same which does not access the element the two dimensional array you intended arrays are not the sameUnlike all other data types int char structs arrays default are passed functions reference and can not returned from function using return statement classes end semicolonDon forget end your class definitions with semicolon class Example Functionsmismatched argumentsThe formal arguments listed function header and prototype must match order number and type there mismatch you may get syntax error from the compiler undefined symbol error from the linker Additionally reference and constant arguments must match arguing about parenthesesEven when function takes arguments you must still include the when calling the function well the prototype and the function header Leaving the parentheses out may not cause syntax error because function name itself refers the function address The example below shows this void display int main display OOPS this doesn call the function int display cout arrays can cause troubles see aboveCopyright copy James Skrentny skrentny wisc edu
