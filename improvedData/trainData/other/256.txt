INFORMATION SPECIFICS Object Tracking Hausdorff Tracker Background Reconstruction Object Segmentation EVALUATION RELATED WORK AND EXTENSIONS REFERENCES Introduction Object tracking sequence images can provide base for multitude digital video processing applications such removal object the scene Although numerous video processing editors are available object tracking and removal OTR mostly manual process Using the existing object tracking feature RiVL implement semi automated application that allows the user specify and remove object then reconstruct the background result new video sequence Our work primarily focuses algorithms for the domain stationary backgrounds with single moving object addition OTR also extend this work segment the tracked object from the background can use the resulting segmentation for variety video processing effects such overlaying the tracked object top different sequence The resulting application ideal test bed for experimenting with various OTR and segmentation algorithms reconstruct the background and use different techniques for segmentation illustrated the diagram below Figure Orwell OTR and Segmentation Overview The rest the paper organized follows Section provides some background RiVL and the Hausdorff tracking algorithm Section discusses vision algorithms employed our ends Section reviews the work have done Section concludes with current status and future research directions Key words object tracking Hausdorff distance object removal segmentation background reconstruction image filtering Background InformationRiVL RiVL resolution independent video language which has video and audio first class data types Jonathan Schwartz has implemented RiVL Tcl extension for multimedia processing The high level operators used RiVL are independent video format and resolution and provides the necessary infrastructure test our ideas RiVL GenC RiVL GenC generates the code for RiVL functions that need perform low level image processing routines that are not already included the RiVL library The implementations median and mean filters use the functions generated RiVL GenC for pixel level computations Hausdorff Tracker The Hausdorff tracker feature based object tracking system for continuous sequence images The model the tracked object represented binary edge map produced applying Canny edge operator over smoothed version the gray level image the input image Taking advantage the fact that the motion the object roughly affine transformation between any two consecutive frames the algorithm matches all the possible translations and scales the model specified search window shown red dotted box Figure Generally the best match has the most points which overlap with transformation the model Since use this best match model for the next image once the tracker begins wander the results can deteriorate quickly Figure Hausdorff tracking algorithm explained Specifics This section discusses the implementation the algorithms accessible from the Orwell Editor The first subsection discusses object tracking The second subsection discusses the background reconstruction algorithms assuming stationary camera and the third subsection discusses the segmentation algorithms Object Tracking Hausdorff Tracker The tracker RiVL returns scale and translation coordinates for each image Performance the tracker depends setting the correct parameters for the search size the search window scaling factors and the forward and backward distance which limits the allowed dissimilarity match must make trade off between the laxness the constraints and the processing time required track the object The Hausdorff tracker also works better for larger images Background Reconstruction need the background replace the tracked object from the original sequence and possibly segment the object experiment with three different approaches background reconstruction temporal median filter temporal mean filter and physical space search The first two approaches for the background reconstruction are temporal mean filter and the temporal median filter Temporal Mean Filter TMEF The TMEF technique computes the mean pixel value taking the arithmetic average the whole frame sequence and assigns this result the pixels the background frame This technique averages out the tracked object the scene with possible blurring effect implement this filter averaging each the RGB values independently Temporal Median Filter TMDF TMDF builds the background frame computing the median pixel value from sorting the images the video sequence This techniques relies the assumption that any portion the tracked object appears any one particular location less than half the image frames implement this filter finding which frame has the median using its gray level value and then reconstructing the background using the corresponding RGB values Both temporal filters are pixel level operations wrote RiVL Genc RiVL Genc only allows twenty frames maximum entered input function and because medians medians not median could not implement true median function over the entire video sequence Instead compute the median for several different samples each sample composing twenty frames set equal intervals and allow the user decide over the best result Physical Space Search Physical space search finds the frame where the bounding box the tracked object does not overlap with the one the currently processed frame that the part background needed replace the object the one that has not been occupied the object the previous frames Using assumptions motion continuity initially search for the the background for the current image near the frame where found the background for the previous frame this way can avoid comprehensive search For the initial frame must search the entire sequence for all possible background replacements Although prefer the closest frame that contains the background also want find multiple scenes which the background resides case that another moving object has moved into the background also possible partition the bounding box into smaller blocks and search for the background pieces assume single moving object the sequence then possible use one frame which has the object removed and the background reconstructed the background for the entire sequence However due shifting lighting levels desirable reconstruct the scene for every frame every block frames Figure shows the result the background covered the subject head reconstruced Figure Sequence illustrating object tracking and background reconstruction Object SegmentationImage Segmentation Segmentation separating the tracked object from the background one the core problems vision that has yet adequately solved for unconstrained settings explore motion differencing second differencing and background subtraction for this classical problem Figure Segmentation methodsA Image Differencing Motion differencing applies threshold over two consecutive images produce binary image indicating the regions motion extend motion differencing use three consecutive frames With second differencing perform binary AND operation the difference image the first two frames and the last two frames segment out the moving object the middle frame Moving objects are more clearly segmented when there exists less overlap the moving object with itself consecutive images choose the three consecutive frames such that there has been sufficient motion Figure Segmentation methodsB Background Subtraction Background subtraction involves application threshold over the background with the image containing the moving object This techniques works well only when used with faithful copy the background EvaluationFigure Input video sequence used the above video sequence frames one the inputs for our test Images were recorded Motion JPEGS with Sun Microsystems camera using Parallax board Mean Median Figure Temporal filter results The example images above are the results from temporal filters The reconstructed background image from the mean filter has slightly visible blurring effect caused the moving object the number frames the video increases this effect will become negligible can further process the mean filter with smoothing function and then sharpening function further rid the shadowing effect Figure Segmentation results for background subtraction choose the eyeball test metric commonly used many vision researchers determine the quality the segmentation Background subtraction produced the best segmentation with the smoothest edges and the least number holes within the object Motion differencing performed the worst since tends give irregular outline the motion and includes portion the background which belongs the object the previous image but not the current image this effect appears undesirable white outline around the object the right pair images below The second differencing method shows improved results over regular motion differencing but still not solid background subtraction Second differencing has advantage over background subtraction since reconstructing the background not necessary Some sort post filtering necessary for all cases fill the holes and smooth the edges Figure Segmentation results for second differencing and motion differencing set out with two fold goal one object removal and the other object segmentation The overall quality object removal depends the accuracy the Hausdorff tracker and the fidelity the reconstructed background feel have accomplished OTR long the background does exist have had less success with segmentation and leave much room for future improvements Related Work and Extensions Multimedia and vision are highly experimental areas embodying numerous possibilities Although tracking and object segmentation are active ares research vision there appears virtually established work automating object removal using background reconstruction can extend this project along these orthogonal directions solve object removal for moving camera handle zooms and pans handle subtle problems object removal such object shadow reflection etc integrate Orwell

windows require the user only use the keyboard type commands command prompt You may note that there menu bar there are menus DOS window Starting DOS Window order run DOS window you must find the DOS Prompt icon the Apps program group and double click the icon You will then have window appear which looks like you are familiar with DOS then you will know how use the command prompt you are not familiar with DOS then can take this opportunity briefly introduce you changing your password Changing Your Password The only thing you need with DOS window and sections change your password the prompt type setpass and press the Enter key You will then prompted for you old password and your new password You will also asked retype your new password for verification Note you type your old and new passwords nothing will appear the screen This done protect your privacy Also capitalization does not matter for your password Exiting DOS Window exit DOS window simply type EXIT and hit the Enter
