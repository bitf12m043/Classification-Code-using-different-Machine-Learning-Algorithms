activities computer algebra fall into three different areas are continuing develop very flexible computer algebra substrate called Weyl which extends Common Lisp have symbolic computing facilities This substrate has functorial architecture that has been implemented using object oriented programming techniques The functorial organization allows one define algebraic structures over arbitrary algebraic domains This approach permits algebraic structures like groups rings and fields first class objects that can manipulated the user have been attempting link together Weyl with Bob Constable theorem proving system Nuprl This will allow state and use theorem about algebraic structures when deciding which algorithms should used Weyl additon have been continuing work algorithms computer algebra Among the problems have been studying include algebraic function decomposition with Dexter Kozen and Susan Landau and primality testing polynomials Publications Effective Polynomial
