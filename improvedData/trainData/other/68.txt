from the list the form select the checkbox search all publishers Unfortunately each Web browser has different rule for multiple selections menu Consult the documentation for your browser for help with this Document Identifier The identifying name the document unique for any given publisher Your entry will matched against any substring the document identifiers the entry will match and document identifier entry always anded bibliographic keyword entries only documents which meet the bibliographic keyword criteria and the document name criteria will returned Please take note that not all documents the collection have abstracts you want your search request include documents without abstracts enter your search criteria under Title well Abstract Your search criteria will rejected you don select least one publisher the all checkbox and specify least one bibliographic keyword document identifier Rules for bibliographic keyword matching Words that you enter the three bibliographic keyword fields Author Title Abstract are matched bibliographic entries according the following rules Each word that you enter matches any word the respective field that begins with respective word For example the word comp matches computer computation comprehensive etc You may choose either the logical connector AND between the bibliographic keyword fields using one the radio buttons below the fields For example you select the button and the word robot the Title field and robotics the Abstract field the search will return documents that have either robot their titles robotics their abstracts you select the and button the search will return only those documents that have robot their titles and robotics their abstracts You may also use logical connectors and and within fields For example you enter robotics vision the abstract field the search will return documents that have the word robotics vision their abstracts you enter robotics and vision the abstract field the search will return documents that have both the word robotics and vision their abstracts Multiple words that are not separated and are assumed and separated For example you enter computer vision the abstract
