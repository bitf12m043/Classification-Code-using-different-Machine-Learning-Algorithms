Renesse February Upcall based distributed systems have become widespread recent years While upcall based systems provide some obvious advantages experiences with these systems have exposed unanticipated problems unpredictability and inefficiency Incorporating system resources information into flow control essential solving these problems Variants window based flow control suitable for distributed systems are investigated Next message packing which improves network bandwidth usage efficiency and consequently message throughput presented Finally back pressure mechanism which controls admission messages into the system blocking applications high load presented The combination the window mechanism and the back pressure mechanism provides end end management system resources The former manages network resources while the latter manages operating system resources The combination maintains good throughput even under high load How view this documentDisplay overview the document

DepartmentCS Spring Bart MillerQuiz Wednesday February Too much too much milk Following solution the bottle Too Much Milk problem using semaphores The problem have refrigerator that will try keep full with bottles milk You live with many roommates Each time roommate comes home they check the refrigerator see milk needed they the store and buy bottle Each person only buys one bottle time Each roommate will process The procedure MilkCheck executed each roommate process when arriving home This procedure has the roommate check the refrigerator and buy milk necessary The solution should make sure that roommate arrives home and milk needed that they buy bottle should also make sure that you never have more than bottles milk the refrigerator any one time Important Try minimize the time that any roommate process stays idle around the refrigerator other words don force roommate wait idle while another roommate the store The program below not quite correct You are fix this program that satisfies the above criteria The bold face text has been added correct the problem Initialization semaphore mutex int numberOfBottles int numberOfShoppers MilkCheck mutex numferOfBottles
