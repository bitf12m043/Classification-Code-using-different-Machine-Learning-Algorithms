made numeric weather models One can make isosurfaces contour line slices colored slices volume renderings etc data grid then rotate and animate the image real time There also feature for wind trajectory tracing way make text anotations for publications etc Here screen shot Vis Click here here for more sample images Vis was written the Visualization Project the University Wisconsin Madison Space Science and Engineering Center SSEC Bill Hibbard and Brian Paul with the help Andre Battaiola CPTEC Sao Paulo Brazil Dave Santek the SSEC Marie Francoise Voidrot Martinez the French Meteorology Office Dave Kamins and Jeff Vroom Stellar Computer Inc Simon Baas and Hans Jong the Netherlands for the VOGL port Pratish Shah Kubota Computer for the Kubota port Mike Stroyan for the PEX support The development Vis was supported the NASA Marshall Space Flight CenterSystem Requirements Vis the most recent version works with the following systems Silicon Graphics workstations with IRIX later Multiple CPUs are used when present IBM workstations with AIX later OpenGL based hardware supported Sun workstations with SunOS later workstations with later PEX based hardware supported DEC Alpha workstations with OSF later IBM compatibles with Linux later MHz Pentium faster CPU recommended Notes least RAM recommended all cases least bit color needed bit color recommended systems without hardware rendering done software with the Mesa library graphics hardware highly recommended The size your memory determines the size data set you can visualize You should have two bytes memory for each point your data set order have maximum interactivity However you can visualize larger data sets with reduced interactivity How get Vis Vis available anonymous ftp from iris ssec wisc edu pub vis
