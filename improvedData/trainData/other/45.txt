Maisie Visual Programming Environment MVPE windows based graphical front end for designing parallel simulations Maisie parallel message passing extension written using Motif similar intent OPNET which simulates networks and SESworkbench The primary advantage MVPE over these commercial systems its direct use parallel simulation language Features entities entity types are specified using extended flow chart notation sample simulations can designed hierarchically with arbitrary depth static communication topology specified graphically automatic code generation compilation and execution Among the extensions planned for future releases are automatic partitioning runtime animation metrics collection libraries predefined entities The following information also available Early Prototypes CSD

Models Proceedings the Fourth International Workshop Modeling Analysis and Simulation Computer and Telecommunication Systems Feb San Jose Gzipped PostScript Abstract Simulation increasingly important aspect network development and parallelization these simulations can result tremendous time performance improvements However tools for developing and parallelizaing simulations are sadly lacking This paper describes MVPE visual programming environment for parallel simulation design This research has been funded part the WAMIS and TRAVLER projects contract info Written Richard Meyer Server Netscape

computers has increased dramatically Bock Laboratories The personal computer capacity image data analysis and manipulation tool has made huge contributions research The Molecular Biology computing group has been active bringing emerging computer graphics and video technologies into the labs computer consultants assist researchers choosing hardware and software that will best fill their needs maintain systems instruct users the use hardware and software and promote integrated and compatible environment that data can easily exchanged These services fall under the normal duties computer support but also provide additional services and these services that this page describes Short History the Laboratory Molecular Biology multimedia servicesDescription Our Services Multimedia services provide are not precisely defined they are limited software and hardware resources time constraints and personnel capabilities What recommend discuss with what you would like done and together can determine the best means implementing the idea The most important constraint the work have done the past time The more time have work project the better the results will recommend coming see soon you begin thinking about project are very willing help you with any animation and video work you have but video projects are very time consuming and have many things besides video work need able work your project into our schedule Hardware and Software Tools The Tools Page gives depth description the specific equipment and products use well other useful information about the tools the trade Services Provided Modeling and Rendering models biological systems can created and animated demonstrate processes See the Anaphase animation the Modeling and Rendering page Titles screens transitions and various effects can created supplement videos MorphingDevelopment can simulated obtaining still images successive stages and morphing from one the next See the Embryogenesis project the morph page Movement can also simulated exactly the same way Many interesting effects can created See the worm morph the morph page AnimationBiological systems can created and animated demonstrate processes Titles and effects Transitions EffectsTitles screens which can include still images animations They can they can incorporate scanned images photo can draw them for you Transitions between video segments including fades wipes animations graphics and animations morphs and animations can incorporated Printing VideoStill frames animations title screens and audio tracks can all printed video viewed standard video players However there are constraints what may printed video These constraints are fully explained this section About these Pages These pages are meant resource specifically for house video work but also for anyone who happens upon this page and can benefit from its information also meant showcase for our services that those the building can get feel for what services can provide for them and those out the building can see what are about what have done and hopefully benefit from our experience plan describe detail what have done and provide examples that can repeated order fully appreciate these pages you will need able view quicktime movies This page last updated November
