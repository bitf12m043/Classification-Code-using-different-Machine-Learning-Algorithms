projects The goal provide show case for sucessfully completed projects well ideas for new projects Contributions are welcome This page from Some the projects might still available few reminders This incomplete list you have specific topic mind feel free contact the appropriate faculty member directly Many the projects can adapted from credits depending how much work you can put You need sign til sept you want get project credits this semester However there generally reason You can the project now and get credit the spring you find that most the interesting projects require knowledge you don have look into extending course project into the Eng project That the best way get the background Project proposalsClaire CardieBuild any number statistical models language processing used for tasks such part speech tagging and word sense tagging natural language text will evaluate the models testing their performance corpus real world text and comparing the results the performance existing language learning system that relies instead symbolic machine learning techniques Note knowledge linguistics required have language acquisition system that uses symbolic machine learning techniques perform number disambiguation tasks natural language texts the word level decide the appropriate meaning part speech word given context This project would involve extending the system handle any number higher level disambiguation tasks like deciding what phrase prepositional phrase modifies went the store JUNE went the store ITHACA distinguishing metaphorical from literal uses phrase deciding that KILLING two birds with one stone does not imply real murder Note knowledge linguistics required Docu Vault project the file cabinet the future Nikos Chrisochoides number projects Problem Solving EnvironmentsRobert Constable Any project offer will part and will assume knowledge Nuprl taught that course will have several ideas for projects during the course Caroline Hecht number projects are available the Theory Center Thomas Henzinger For the following projects you should familiar with and programming finite automata theory little bit logic and college level calculus The additional requirements for each project are listed below Hybrid System Simulation Write simulator for hybrid systems which are distributed real time systems that consist interacting digital and analog components User Interface Write parser for graphical hybrid system description language which provides the input for the hybrid system simulator You have know window programming Scientific Visualization Use computer graphics and animation tools visualize the output the hybrid system simulator You have know window programming some computer graphics and animation tool Programming Language Translation Write compiler translate one hybrid system description language into another You have know lex and yacc Bruce Land Possible projects visuailzation parallel algorithms DSTool interface greyscale stereogram cycling through several stereograms Mosaic document structure browser Compress decompress modules for network computing Mosaic conversion documents Parallelize tensor modules eigenvalue vector arithmetic Matrix inversion module High dimensional vis development rotations figure correlations hyperplanes Neural simulator module single compartment nonlinear cell abstract

construction from sample points Wavelet transform Joe SkoviraQMG software package for finite element mesh generation have several projects connected with QMG including graphics interoperation with other software packages and extensions the basic algorithms Prerequisites for this project are knowledge matlab and numerical analysis course Thorsten von EickenA MBit ATM network with Sparc available for projects Some thes involve parallel programming for which the IBM also available WWW project develop extensions WWW servers protocols and browsers enhance the support video interactivity customizability etc Docu Vault project the file cabinet the future Werner VogelsAir traffic simulator project build the various blocks that make real air traffic control system that can construct experimental environment for the next generation air traffic control systems Horus groupware project build collection small modules using Horus that will assist the software designer building wide variety groupware applications Distributed Operating Systems research projects give students the opportunity get their hands dirty some real operating systems research are offering number projects based the plan distributed operating system and the VSTA public micro kernel Ramin ZabihWrite package for displaying images and color overlays probably top OpenGL Build system for finding and tracking people sequence images Experience with and images required Experiment with the use visual motion for image compression Write programs that write programs for extremely efficient local image processing Experience with images not required but extensive experience with and perhaps some knowledge Lisp necessary Construct and benchmark algorithms for visual motion and stereo based robust statistics especially least median squares Minimal experience with images required Various projects the Robot Vision Lab Rich Zippel There are two basic areas which are active development very high level software development tools especially scientific computation and infrastructure support collaboration among people separated time and space the very high level software area are developing new programming paradigm where very high level specifications computations are converted executable programs via sequence user controlled program transformations Among the projects this area are Develop and code new program transformations for parallelization new numerical computation techniques transformation that instantiate particular concurrency control mechanism couple the existing transformations and external tools perform some large scale simulations bone growth explosion comet gravitation collapse pair black holes Develop and improve the user interface the program transformation process using either Apple Common Lisp Unix Emacs the Synthesizer Generator Since this our programs include descriptions three dimensional objects this may include some novel interactions with graphics programs Linkage program transformation technology with the theorem proving and computational logic techology being developed Prof Constable group For collaboration would like integrate our tools and technologies with the emerging standards the Internet few these projects are listed below but there are wide number different possibilities The manuals for our tools have been written Framemaker For highest quality printing would perfer LaTeX Develop tools and processes that World Wide Web documents HTML can mantained parallel with the Framemaker documents Develop automatic tools and processes for going back and forth between Framemaker and Latex WWW manual should organized and linked different fashion than printed manual Develop mechanisms and guidelines aid maintaining printed and line manuals concurrently Develop databases and links between Lotus Notes and WWW for running software development project How should bug tracking handled releases versions manuals user comments demonstrations etc For further information about this WWW page contact Thorsten von Eicken Date Mon Jan GMT Server NCSA Last modified Fri Dec GMT Content type text html Content
