GMT Child Play Child Play Special Event Second Workshop End User Programming and Education September held conjunction with IEEE Symposium Visual Languages September Boulder Colorado Updates Agenda and Directions how get the workshop site and what register for Child Play via the registration pages linked Child Play Demos Child Play participants get demo participants linked Position Papers WHO attending and what they think about End User Programming and Education linked Problem Centered Visual Language BenchmarksWhat Child Play all day pre conference workshop bringing together diverse group researchers teachers and artists who are actively involved designing creating and applying programming environments for end users especially kids The workshop will also include special panel demo event held during the conference like stress the hands nature the workshop giving participants the opportunity demo their systems and allocating time play with all the other systems the Child Play workshop system designers analyzed and compared the computational characteristics systems including AgentBuilder Agentsheets Cartoonist Chart Art ChemTrains KidSim and ToonTalk This year will examine the programming environments more from user perspective than system perspective what ways end users and specifically kids benefit from using any individual system combination systems Theme but programming not the test This year theme will the impact end user programmable systems education How effective are end user programming approaches vehicles for learning Faced with very little evidence transfer from programming mathematics even general problem solving skills many educators have moved away from the programming vehicle reach mathland view computer use Increasingly programming environments such Basic and Logo are put aside and programming math classes are replaced with classes teaching computer applications such word processors and drawing programs Has programming generally failed vehicle creativity could new programming and teaching approaches avoid this bleak scenario Participants should make arguments how their approach overcomes some the following problems Why should people use your somebodye else system Who should use the system what kind context can the system work home workplace school What the motivation use What kind skills are learned using How feasible the use you system traditional university workplace setting resources time space money How educational settings need changed better accommodate new kinds learning How the skills learned some virtual computer environment map real world skills Specific Goals Understand the impact end user programming education Join people from the computers and education community with the visual languages community Establish World Wide Web repository generic end user programming problem benchmarks and system specific solutions Pre Workshop activities This year the workshop will only one day make this work best require you contribute two ways Submit position statement not exceed pages HTML ASCII assessing your work with respect its impact education Ideally refer the issues raised this CFP your are not system author educator think about what kind system you could use your teaching activity Your document will put the World Wide Web under the Child Play heading your document HTML file feel free refer any page the web for instance you can use this point your home page pages describing your related systems you already have some kind position statement the web just send the URL During last years Child Play workshop enumerated large set programming problem benchmarks will make these benchmarks available you have started create World Wide Web repository generic end user programming problem benchmarks and system specific solutions believe that crucial for the end user programming and visual programming community have such repository instrument assess the applicability systems problems Participation and Deadlines There minimal workshop participation fee cover hand outs and food participate Submit position statement not exceed pages HTML ASCII describing your work with respect its impact onto education Send your position statement Alexander Repenning ralex colorado edu The position statements will available the web Deadline Feb but will help other participants send soon possible you get demo your system you have one Child Play and participants Wednesday September you are encouraged also attend the conference and submit paper The paper deadline Feb Organizers Alexander Repenning University Colorado Roland Hubscher Georgia Institute Technology Clayton Lewis University Colorado For more information contact Alexander Repenning For idea what Child Play might
