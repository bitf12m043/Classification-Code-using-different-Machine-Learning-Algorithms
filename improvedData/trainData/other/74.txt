the World Wide Web Mosaic Our local Internet specialist extolled the versatility and usefulness the Web and charged each major with the task creating his her own home page the second meeting Abernethy talked about his summer research the NASA JOVE program Pasadena Although the slide projector was behaving little too nondeterministically for his tastes pulled off very interesting and impressive presentation Because its proximity exams the third meeting had program addition the meetings planned have one speaker per term come give related talk This term Barret Bryant from the University Alabama Birmingham came enlighten about object oriented database programming The language that researching grant from IBM CORAL Concurrent Object oriented Relational Access Language The implications object oriented databases are far reaching are those parallel computing you might imagine combining these two paradigms makes for some interesting possibilities effort promote non computer science related activity also planned least one event per month strictly social October showed the computer themed movie Sneakers captive small audience also showed the Simpsons Halloween episodes all five

enrichment program Its success has led NSF funding for second summer program for Additional support for this program from the Frederick Symmes Foundation enabled expand its scope and include six Symmes Scholars from the local area second NSF grant has provided state the art multimedia computing facilities support significant enhancements our introductory computing courses This project also benefited greatly from grants from the Reeves Foundation and the Charles Frueauff Foundation third NSF grant coupled with donation from Silicon Graphics Inc has funded innovative multidisciplinary course Computer Science Mathematics and Physics Computational Science These same three departments are engaged curriculum revision and innovation incorporate multimedia and scientific visualization experiences into their programs This ambitious project received major boost with funding for from the William Keck Foundation June proposal pending the Kresge Foundation would provide the resources necessary complete this project and challenge Furman provide one million dollar endowment fund perpetuate the benefits and achievements gained Augmenting this project Furman received its first NASA JOVE program grant support space related research September Porter and are participants and the grant will provide scholarship and summer research stipend support for four Furman computing students per year All these efforts will have tremendous impact the computing experiences our students and have provided Furman with computing environment that exemplar national standards hope all you will
