Implicit surfaces are generated finding level surfaces field That placing polygons all the voxels which have scalar data certain value The surface descriptions often take forms familar from analytical geometry For instance unit sphere the origin described when surface fit the points which have value zero Procedure Download heart net heart cfg SurfaceCombine netSurfaceCombine cfgblobbyMacroUI net blobbyMacroUI cfg Put the following yourID DXmacros than when starts will find these macros Note the programs this exercise will not run without these macros InitCSGmacro netMakeCSGsurfacemacro netUnionCSGmacro netblobbyMacro net The program heart net takes input implicit function and forms surface The function calculated grid points then polygonalized isosurface rendering assuming isosurface value zero For example the formula creates heart shaped object Different functions will produce different shapes Note that for different functions you may have modify the range limits the space defined the Construct module example the following image was made defining implicit sphere separate module from the heart then morphing between them linearly intropolating between the two fields this case mixing the heart field with the sphere field The sphere used was The program SurfaceCombine net shows how combine two implicit surfaces simulate the union operation used constructive solid geometry see page Watt Three new macros are used this program InitCSG UnionCSG and MakeCSGsurface You can inspect modify the macros using the Open Selected Macro option the Windows menu the visual program editor The two cylinder surfaces are combined the UnionCSG macro using min function that the voxels which are the interior either cylinder are interior the result Remember that implicit function changes sign the surface crossed and that for the surfaces used here that points inside have negative value The image below the result the union two cylinders The program blobby net computes implicit surface based spherical fields influence which can add together See one last year student projects for more information blobby functions The spherical fields can have positive and negative field strengths example from blobby net shows four positive spheres transparent red and two negative spheres blue which when summed together then passed thorough isosurface module produce the object shown the right Assignment Execute the programs understand their behavior then modify them follows Modify heart net generate torus from implicit function You will need construct function which negative the position within certain distance circle and positive otherwise Include interactors set the radius the torus and the radius its cross section Extend SurfaceCombine net perform the CSG operations intersection and subtraction writing two new macros called IntersectCSG and SubCSG Provide interactors for choosing any combination two spheres cylinders tori cones Provide interactors for performing union intersection subtraction the two selected shapes That your program should able for example select sphere and cone and form the subtraction cone minus sphere sphere minus cone union the sphere and the cone intersect the sphere and the cone Shown below are the intersection two cylinders and one cylinder minus the other The image below formed superquadric minus torus union cylinder but with about white noise added the field Use the interactors blobby net make human head with recognizable but not necessarily artistic eyes nose mouth and ears Modify blobbyMacroUI net produce two separate groups blobs with separate interactor inputs which can combined using your CSG modules You will need modify blobby macro net output field rather than surface Show one example separate blob groups combined with CSG operations prepared demo the programs show the torus generator the CSG operations the head you designed and the grouped blobby program The grader will exercise all interactors You should able explain your programs You should use transmitters receivers macros and comments the Notation field each module that you and the grader can understand the program Control panels any should well organized labeled and with the appropriate numeric ranges The Lab grading guide will filled out consultant during section evaluate your work Back Main Page Last modified Land Copyright

parallel computing and system software Some reprints publications are available PostScript files The gossip problem easy pose each vertex graph initially holds unique piece information communicated all other vertices each time step vertex can only communicate with its neighbors Information can freely combined between communication steps Variants the gossip problem involve minimizing the total number communications the total time under variety restrictions which communication steps are allowed The following two papers deal mainly with the case where each vertex can only send receive from one neighbor time Gossiping Minimal Time obtains lower and upper bounds the time gossip for several types graphs Fast Gossiping for the Hypercube addresses the difficult question finding good upper bound the time gossip the case the dimensional hypercube The following two papers deal with the most studied formulation the gossip problem which two way pairwise communication possible that each communication step pair vertices exchange all knowledge Reordered Gossip Schemes presents simple theorem that subsumes and generalizes several major theorems about this type gossiping and solves open problem some twenty years standing Representations Gossip Schemes technical paper establishing very general notation for depicting gossip schemes work parallel programming has mainly involved debugging support The Perils Parallel Programming case study that lists several distinct kinds bugs that can encountered with message passing parallel computers David Krumme krumme tufts edu
