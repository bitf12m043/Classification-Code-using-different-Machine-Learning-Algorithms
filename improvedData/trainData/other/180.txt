useful the entire department but without official support adm Current AnnouncementsSynopsisHow accessWhat usr publicWhat should not usr publicDirectory organizationHow obtain further helpOther pages available usr public Current List czars Upson familiar quotesAfter Cornell surveySpace used each user usr publicQuery database for all files usr publicCurrent Announcements The public czar currently updating these pages and conducting periodic cleanup the usr public directory you have somthing usr public and you haven used while please consider removing Synopsis usr public directory which mounted all the departmental Suns contains all software which considered useful the entire community and not officially supported adm All software usr public provided without any guarantees other users determine who responsible for program look the owner the executable There also public czar that informally manages the directory Periodically this czar will walk through the directory looking for space and you have installed something you may receive message from the czar asking the program still useful are always short space this may happen fairly often The public czar also available provide assistance you need help finding installing something you feel something needs changed The public czar currently Jason Hickey but mail can directly sent the alias public czar which will always kept date How access usr public access the binaries usr public include usr local pub bin into your path defined cshrc You should have this the end your path for security reasons Games are stored directory which may accessed with usr local public games Many useful manual entries are also usr public man and may accessed adding the environment variable MANPATH For example the following reasonable way define MANPATH setenv MANPATH usr share man usr public manWhat usr public usr public contains user supported software Here list some reasonable things put usr public compilers for unusual languages experimental editors games odd utilities and data files Sources for executables should stored usr public src For security reasons sources should available whenever possible Include manual pages usr public man Look that directory for some examples Remember the manual entry often the only clue about what program does There are tips help files the normal area Feel free add tips files usr public man man Remember that these files need troff man format Look existing man page figure out you would like add WWW info contact the public czar who will add this file There also emacs texinfo page documentation can added that way too All public games are stored usr public games These are managed the games czar who ultimately responsible for what stays and what goes Sources for most games are usr public src games Please not make private copies the games because they waste lot disk space particular not copy the fortune database file What should not usr public easy crowd public disk with useless junk Core dumps and object files should removed quickly possible Executables should stripped see strip Large sources for stable programs should deleted not throw something onto usr public unless these good reason believe that other people might use Never put software into usr public which questionable origin viruses are daily concern something seems strange not hesitate bring usr public often fills This leads lots finger pointing and nasty messages try polite you really value something but everyone else does not seem care move your home directory Directory organization usr public holds binaries for several architectures make access somehat machine independent architecture dependent executables are available usr local pub bin which will always link the appropriate directory Architecure independent files are always kept usr public share This includes shell scripts images emacs info pages WWW pages and other assorted architecture independent files This true even though right now mostly use sparc sunos throughout the department Remember solaris the way like not makes you feel more comfortable add link from executables you install usr public share bin corresponding directory entries usr public sun solaris bin you install the wrong place the public czar will always come around correct you Here summary usr public adm for the public czar look here for stats you want usr public cdi various info this will get incorporated into this page usr public dependent files usr public include Architecture independent include files This should link usr public share include usr public lisp don really know why have this may away soon usr public This just give you hard time usr public src Source directories for the installed programs Any program whether one file not should installed directory here usr public sun sun sunos libraries and executables usr public sun games Games for sun sunos usr public solaris sun sunos libraries and executables usr public

WISCONSIN MADISON Computer Sciences DepartmentCS Spring Bart MillerQuiz Wednesday February Using Monitors Save Your Life You are write the code provide the synchronization control access couple pedestrian bridges The bridges are used cross dangerous shark infested river The picture below illustrates the problem You have provided you already written procedure called CrossBridge bridgenum You don know how long this takes execute This procedure causes the person process cross bridge bridgenum which can have valid values person starting the east shore will end the west shore person starting the west shore will end the east shore This procedure returns when the action completed Use monitors the synchronization mechanism for your solution Use the syntax that was presented lecture monitors are simply classes with the extra monitor keyword Each person process and these processes arrive randomly You will write procedure called Person that will called people wanting cross the river You will write any additional procedures that you need Your solution must obey the following rules Each bridge strong enough hold only person time Additional people will break the bridge and they all will fall the river and eaten there more than one person wanting cross the river both bridges should use the same time People should get use the bridge approximately the same order which they arrived Initially both bridges are unoccupied Hint the Person procedure probably not the monitor You might consider having this procedure call procedures BridgeControl monitor this similar how did the readers
