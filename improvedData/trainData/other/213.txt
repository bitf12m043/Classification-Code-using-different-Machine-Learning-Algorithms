Dimensional ArraysOne Dimensional Arrays arrays have one subscript The subscript specifies which value the array you want INTEGER SCORES PRINT SCORES View the array single row boxes SCORES Only one subscript needed uniquely specify any particular position the array Two Dimensional Arrays arrays have two subscripts arrayname sizeX sizeY CHARACTER TICTAC The size the array number values can store equals sizeX sizeY TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC different values access particular value specify both its subscripts the column coordinate and row coordinate arrayname column row PRINT TICTAC READ TICTAC Important The order the subscripts very important TICTAC TICTAC View array grid TICTAC Two subscripts are needed uniquely specify position the grid the column and row with arrays subscripts can literals variables expressions any combination thereof TICTAC COL TICTAC NINT COS arrays not have square The number rows and columns can differ INTEGER GRADES PRINT Grades for student STU GRA PRINT GRADES STU GRA END Arrays and Loops arrays are processed with single loops whose counter used the array subscript COUNT MAXSIZ PRINT SCORES COUNT END arrays are processed with two loops Both counters are used array subscripts Important loops must nested PRINT TICTAC END END Use implied loop for the inner loop that all the values for each row appear the same line Print rows axis Print columns each row axis PRINT TICTAC END Important outer loop for rows inner loop for columns Array ArgumentsTo pass arrays arguments user defined function subroutine pass the array name and the array size PRINT GETMAX SCORES MAXSIZ INTEGER FUNCTION GETMAX LIST SIZE pass arrays arguments pass the array name and both the array sizes sizeX and sizeY SHOW TICTAC SUBROUTINE SHOW BOARD SIZEX SIZEY Prints the board the screen Declare arguments INTEGER SIZEX SIZEY CHARACTER BOARD SIZEX SIZEY Print rows axis SIZEY Print columns each row axis PRINT BOARD SIZEX END RETURN END DATA StatementThe DATA statement provides convenient way initialize array DATA arrayname value value INTEGER MAXSIZ PARAMETER MAXSIZ INTEGER SCORES MAXSIZ DATA SCORES DATA statement should appear immediately after the array declaration Can initialize array all the same values zero DATA arrayname arraysize value DATA SCORES MAXSIZ Column Major OrderInternally arrays are stored list values like long array column major order where each column stored next each other this case the column considered the first subscript TICTAC column row CHARACTER TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC TICTAC PRINT READ WRITEthe whole array initialize with DATA statement then array values will listed column major order TICTAC For example PRINT TICTAC prints Parallel ArraysOften have several arrays the same size storing related values For example student name grades year and GPA INTEGER NUMSTU PARAMETER NUMSTU CHARACTER NAME NUMSTU INTEGER GRADES NUMSTU CHARACTER YEAR NUMSTU REAL GPA NUMSTU Called parallel arrays because all the values for particular student have the same subscript For student Name NAME Grades GRADES Year YEAR GPA GPA Display every student data NUMSTU PRINT Name NAME PRINT Grades GRADES PRINT Year YEAR PRINT GPA GPA END Copyright copy Gareth Bestor bestor wisc edu Last modified May
