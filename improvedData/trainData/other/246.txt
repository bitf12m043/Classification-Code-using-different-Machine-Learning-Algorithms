Directory Aug iotrace Aug readrec Aug readtrace Aug record Aug The raw trace ftp ftp princeton edu pub people ultrix traces tar Enclosed here are the traces collected from number applications and the program that parses them and prints out the records The applications are dinero trace trace driven cache simulator Access pattern the trace file read sequentially multiple times cscope trace cscope searching symbol names large kernel source Access pattern the database file read sequentially multiple times cscope trace cscope searching text strings large kernel source Access pattern collection multiple source code files read the same order sequentially multiple times cscope trace cscope searching text strings small kernel source Access pattern collection multiple source code files read the same order sequentially multiple times The difference between cscope and cscope that cscope data set larger than cscope glimpse trace searching for key words among collection text files Access pattern there two sets files index files and data files Index files are much smaller than the collection data files Index files are read sequentially multiple times and based the result searching the indices some groups data files are read Each group data files are always read sequentially the same order every time trace link editing the kernel Access pattern random accesses including both read and write reuse data but since the size read request not always there are reuse the block level block bytes and often the granularity caching postgres trace postgres doing selection there index available Access pattern the index searched first then selected tuples are read moderate reuse file blocks due one block holding multiple tuples postgres pjoin trace postgres doing join between indexed inner relation and non index outer relation Access pattern The outer relation read sequentially once and the index the inner relation search repeatedly everytime tuple the outer relation XDataSlice xds trace volume rendering software working data volume rendering slices with stride along the axis then axis then axis Access pattern access blocks file with regular strides reuse when rendering along one axis but moderate reuse between the rendering along different axises sort bigsort trace UNIX external sorting utility sorting line tex file Access pattern first segment the file into small files that are sorted memory and wrote out temporary file then temporary files are merge sorted into the final sorted file Both read and write intensive For more detailed information these applications see OSDI paper inproceedings CFL author Pei Cao and Edward Felten and Kai title Implementation and Performance Application Controlled File aching booktitle Proc First USENIX Symposium Operating Systems Design Implementation month nov year pages For more detailed description what XDataSlice does NCSA ftp server and check their visualization package The events that are traced all come with time stamp which the time field struct tracerecord see iotrace The time field actually the value counter that goes MHz granularity thus unsigned bit int and wraps around every seconds that right The field struct tracerecord the event identifier the record Its possible values are listed iotrace The events traced fall two categories system calls almost all file system related syscalls see the listing iotrace for the value tracerecord between and kernel events MYTRACE RWEND the kernel finished the processing read write system call the time between the read write system call and the MYTRACE RWEND event the time took the kernel process this call MYTRACE RDBEGIN and MYTRACE RDBEGIN disk read request issued the disk the flags are different because they are issued different routines MYTRACE RDBEGIN bread and MYTRACE RDBEGIN breada MYTRACE RDEND and MYTRACE RDEND the read request issued MYTRACE RDBEGIN MYTRACE RDBEGIN has just finished MYTRACE RARDBEGIN Ultrix has one block lookahead prefetching algorithm that block file read and the kernel see that the last read file block then the kernel prefetches block This prefetch ReadAhead recorded MYTRACE RARDBEGIN MYTRACE BUSYEND read write system call finds that the block wants read marked busy that currently progress for this block then waits till the busy bit turned off This happens for example when readahead was issued for this block the previous read system call MYTRACE BUSYEND record the time when the busy bit the block cleared and the process can read write the block MYTRACE BWRBEGIN disk write request issued note that although user processes always wait for the read request they don necessary wait for the write request Most the time the write request asynchronous MYTRACE BWREND the above write request synchronous then this event record the time when finishes detailed Kernel activities only some traces recorded these detailed events that don bothered they don show particular trace actually think they show any the traces put here tracing utility evolve over time MYTRACE BIODONE disk request finished MYTRACE RDBEGIN INBREAD disk read request issued the bread routine ufs code MYTRACE RDEND INBREAD the time when that request finished MYTRACE RDBEGIN INBREAD and MYTRACE RDEND INBREAD should always appear pairs MYTRACE RDBEGIN INBRDA disk read request issued the breada routine ufs code MYTRACE RDEND INBRDA time when this request has finished MYTRACE RDNEXT INBRDA readahead request issued breada MYTRACE BUSYWAIT read write system call finds that the block needs access busy about sleep wait for the busy bit cleared MYTRACE BUSYWAIT records when this happens The structure the trace record the following pid pid the user process event identifier num inode number the file accessed dev device number the file accessed offset offset file the read write request count size the read write request time clock counter Note num only meaningful for the system call events you should ignore the num field for all other events dev meaningful for most events records the dev number the device which the issued offset and count are only meaningful for read and write system calls ignore them for all other events Source files iotrace header file for the trace records and event identifiers rec trace the macro the kernel source uses record event readtrace prints out each record the raw trace file human readable form readrec library routine for simulator reads the tracerecords from trace files and return generic record used simulator ignores the kernel events may not that useful you record the header file for the generic record type used simulator More questions Contact cao wisc edu Pei
