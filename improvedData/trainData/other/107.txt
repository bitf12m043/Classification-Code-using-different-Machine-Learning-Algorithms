Ill Posed Linear Complementarity Problem Mangasarian August regularization the linear complementarity problem LCP proposed that leads exact solution one exists otherwise minimizer natural residual the problem obtained The regularized LCP RLCP turns out linear program with equilibrium constraints LPEC that always solvable For the case when the underlying matrix the LCP the class LCP solvable feasible the RLCP can solved quadratic program which convex positive semidefinite explicitly exact penalty the RLCP formulation also given when and implicitly exact otherwise Error bounds the distance between arbitrary point the set LCP residual minimizers follow from LCP error bound theory Computational algorithms for solving the RLCP consist solving convex quadratic program for positive
