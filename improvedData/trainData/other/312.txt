The exam dates are Midterm Wednesday Chemistry Midterm Tuesday tba Final Wednesday tba Make exams for the midterms are given only with permission when you are unable take the regular exam due extenuating circumstances request for makeup exam must made during office hours and must brought attention two weeks before the exam date will waive this requirement for verifiable emergencies but requests for make ups will accepted after the actual exam given There will make for the final Final exam dates are listed the Timetable that students can avoid conflicting final exams Exam FormatExams have from five ten questions some having multiple parts are designed for two hour exam period and average score points out Exam questions fall into three categories tracing code writing code and miscellaneous You can expect see each these three categories the exams Tracing requires you demonstrate understanding code provided showing the output results generated diagraming code execution describing what code does general Coding questions require you demonstrate your knowledge data structures and syntax semantics writing code solve the particular problem described Sometimes code provided that you need use supplement finish the question Miscellaneous questions cover the broad spectrum question styles such true false fill the blank multiple choice short answer questions General Studying TipsPrioritize your studying When create the exams consider first what covered during lectures then the programming assignments and finally the reading materials Study your notes course this obvious but many about studying their notes the wrong manner Don just highlight your notes and think that counts reading them Don just reread your notes and think that counts studying them Successful studying requires you more involved and actively thinking about the material One the most effective ways study reorganize and rewrite your notes succinct manner terms that you understand Avoid getting bogged down specific points you can figure something out move other material and wait ask the TAs You need some memorizing Memorizing practical way learn the definitions terminology and concepts good way memorize information through repeated exposure the material Form study group often easier and more motivating work with others when studying for exam You can distribute the work having each group member come with few questions and then going over the solutions collectively you run into concept that causes confusion often others the group will have similar difficulty Together the group can figure something out more quickly than individual because the multiple perspectives the members bring the group Finally avoid cramming all know this However though promise ourselves that will start studying early often find ourselves waiting til too late This habit worth breaking Studies have shown that studying half hour hour intervals followed half hour breaks far more effective than non stop cramming Exam TopicsBasic discussed Appendix the text will not directly tested but will required answer questions concerning topics listed below The key topics covered are listed below Basic objects and classes OOP interface implementation public private data members and member functions constructors and destructor using objects and calling methods Advanced using default arguments OOP initializer
