AswinIntroduction Being position power You are charge what songs are being played However also bears heavy responsibility What you are doing should what the people want for being means always play better music push limits speak That the attractive thing about being plain words like play hot music much for the blabla let see how works How Use Our Equipment Turn the main switch the extension box the far right corner the desk turn that switch off the end the hop Make sure everything The amplifier should have the buttons for tape and tuner don ask why There extra small switch box with three buttons mic tape and Make sure pressed have and TAPE play music the Mixer you use for BOX for and TAPE for the lower double tape deck Now play some music not put the sliding switches over since this can distort the music Everytime you put new song check the volume level When you program ready adjust the volume you are the floor How program This the disc player Put Close the slide When programming track make sure you know the disc and the track advance Press program then press one the disc buttons the left then press the track number the right then press and the two digits This should all happen quick order How change and program when music playing Press exchange open the slide Put the you want Press exchange again Then program before How program TAPE Will put later version What Play have three sorts music mainly dance Jitterbug Music Like Bill Haley Jerry Lee Lewis Big Joe Turner speed beats per minute Lindy Hop Music Old Swing Band Music Like Benny Goodman Glen Miller Count Basie Duke Ellington West Coast Swing Music Like King Bonnie Raitt Delbert Clinton Almost all are marked with the speed kind and quality CDs are also marked color blue red yellow orange means Carolina Shag When you start ing you can never wrong playing songs that are marked play those lot When you start picking more your own music aware the following the style the rhythm section that determines the dance style not just the speed faster tune might feel more like and feel like WCS and slower tune might have older style bouncy beat and feel more like slow Lindy Only when you get more experienced you should bring more and more your own music hope not sound rigid since every has different taste and style often happened that song that liked very much home did not work all the dance floor Music for dancing pretty specific get some experience first before you start experimenting the ratio use the following guideline Jitterbug Lindy Hop West Coast Swing For example could play etc Play for the People Try play what people like hardly anybody dancing song probably not good tune not tire people play fast songs row Also there are lot beginners the dances especially early the evening normally play only few songs over night This als the case for Play slow one and then faster one Variation the key your success Length Songs Five minute songs are too long song very long over minutes try fade out there great song that you would like entire length then consider having people change partners several times people not have dance with the same partner for long time This called mixer Mixers are done follows begin quote Announce the beginning that mixer Then when you want people change partners lower the music and announce the change make sure that people are really changing partners they normally not hear you end quote Sound Level Every song recorded different sound level Therefore should always monitor the sound level the start each song Sometimes also desirable adjust the treble and bass using the equalizer for further reading see hereBy Aswin MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last Modified Thursday Nov GMT Helpful Web PagesHelpful

For this program you will read list INTEGER values from the user entered one per line These values will read into array integers After reading all the numbers your program will perform series operations the array The operations that you will implement are Find the minimum and maximum value the array Count the number prime numbers the array That how many numbers are only divisible themselves and Print whether the array strictly ascending descending order neither That check each adjacent pair numbers the array see they are order This assignment uses user defined functions and user defined subroutines Chp and one dimensional arrays Chp All the input will read from the keyboard and the results will written directly the screen files Example the user enters the following INTEGER values then your program should display hint use this check your results The minimum value The maximum value There are prime numbers The numbers are neither ascending nor descending Program Design find the minimum and maximum number the array assume the first number the array the current min max and then through the rest the array and compare each number with the current min max and assign these values accordingly similar finding the minimum time Program Note the numbers can both positive and negative INTEGERs count the number primes through the array and for each number check see prime number not see any value besides and the number itself evenly divides into the number turns out prime then increment counter accordingly determine the list numbers strictly ascending descending order through each pair numbers the array the second number greater than equal the first then the list must necessarily not descending order the second number less than equal the first then the list must necessarily not ascending order Not only takes one pair numbers the wrong order make the whole list not ascending descending Program Structure Your program must first read the numbers into one dimensional array using loop After reading the array then pass the array the relevant user defined function subroutine calculate the results Each operation will performed separate user defined function subroutine They are MINMAX Find the minimum and maximum value the array This subroutine passed the array integers and passes out both the minimum and maximum value PRIME Counts the number prime numbers the array This function passed the array integers and returns the total number primes UPDOWN Determines whether the array strictly ascending order strictly descending order neither Note two adjacent numbers that are the same are not considered ascending nor descending This function passed the array integers and returns whether the numbers are ascending descending neither suggest writing the MINMAX function first because the easiest then PRIME which little harder and finally UPDOWN because requires the most thought Once you have debugged each function subroutine and got working then move the next one Don attempt write everything and debug all once instead one piece time This one the biggest advantages writing user defined functions and subroutines What Hand Hand this assignment online copying your FORTRAN source code file program for and the compiled executable file program exe your handin directory You also have hand printed copy your FORTRAN source code file and the screen output when your program run with the four sets test data given the gradesheet Gradesheet The following gradesheet will used grade this assignment Please take close look make sure you everything that required Note that you will graded correct output for the input values given below before handing you must run your program with these values and manually check that your program gives the correct results every case Correct Output User Interface Useful prompts for each number Meaningful display results Implementation Correct use functions subroutines and arguments Correct use arrays Correct use THEN ELSE END statement Correct use END loop Meaningful variable names Indenting and neatness Documentation Program description Function and subroutine descriptions Variable and
