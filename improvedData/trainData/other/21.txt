Generic Plan for Finishing the Project Time will easier you write your code stages The code reviews provide intermediate feedback your progress Here how suggest working the code for some reason you think that your particular project doesn fit well into the structure below let know and can help you create schedule that does First think about the major modules that your project requires and the knowledge structures rules state descriptions board representations that you need including any related constructor functions and accessor functions described Winston our main text Implement the modules stubs lisp functions that have substantive code but that specify all the necessary parameters and that make calls the appropriate module stubs Write the code implement your generic knowledge structures completed for code review Oct Get the system running from beginning end soon possible just simple example This will invariably require making many simplifying assumptions Design the inference engine control strategies needed for your system specific search strategy rule interpreter move generator learning algorithm completed for code review Nov Finish the implementation the part inference engine control strategies learning algorithm your system Incrementally remove the simplifying assumptions adding the necessary code Evaluate the system appropriately sure leave enough time

Sep GMT Syllabus for Syllabus for Computer Science University Texas Austin Fall Objectives Although computers are used widely most users don understand how they work what they can and what they cannot This course will teach the fundamental principles computing surveying many the major areas computer science including algorithms languages computer architecture parallel computation and artificial intelligence Projects involving Pascal programming will accompany the survey Objectives required textbook Great Ideas Computer Science Alan Biermann MIT Press optional textbook strongly recommended Fundamentals Computer Science Study Guide Wesley Ulm This Guide was written supplement Great Ideas Computer Science For each chapter Great Ideas the Guide presents set problems and their complete solutions The Guide costs about and available Speedway Copy and Printing Guadalupe Suite Dobie Mall Grading Final grades will assigned curve based the following components Midterm Midterm Final Lab Exercises Exams The first Midterm Exam will cover only the material covered the first six weeks the semester The second Midterm Exam cumulative but will emphasize the material covered during weeks The Final Exam cumulative but will emphasize the material covered during weeks study for the exams you should review the assigned readings and your notes from the lectures and discussion sessions Without valid proof unexpected emergency you will receive grade zero you miss exam Lab Exercises Lab exercises will assigned almost every week discussion sessions You should start work the exercises while the discussion sessions and complete them outside class The Due Date will clearly stated for each exercise Without valid proof unexpected emergency you will receive grade zero you miss the deadline You may turn exercises your any proctor the computer lab you turn exercise outside your normal discussion session you are advised ask for receipt Cheating Turning exam which not entirely your own work cheating Turning programming assignment which not entirely your own work cheating Cheating results immediate course grade and formal petition for expulsion from the University exceptions Group
