Wolberg Street and Mangasarian During the past six years colleagues and the University Wisconsin Madison have taken mathematical technique originally developed for oil prospecting and modified create computerized method diagnosing cancer breast tissue samples obtained technique called fine needle aspiration FNA the past interpreting FNA samples has been rather subjective but with our program have been able develop accurate and objective system FNA interpretation With this computer program are also able for the first time calculate mathematical probability that sample malignant rather than having use fuzzy terms such atypical suspicious sharing this probability data with patients involve them the decision making process greater degree than has previously been possible particular instead our having make recommendation based solely upon our own values can provide patients with the probability data and let them make their own minds subsequent treatment While don expect that our computer program will putting pathologists out business any time soon expect that will prove useful objective backup for pathologists and assist them improving their FNA interpretative skills THE ROLE FNA BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS the majority all beast cancer cases discovery mass feeling lump the breast represents the first sign that cancer present However finding breast mass does not necessarily signal that cancer present indeed most breast masses are benign not malignant Currently the only definitive way distinguish between benign and malignant breast masses for pathologist examine sample breast tissue under microscope obtain such tissue surgeons have traditionally performed breast biopsy which they take patient the operating room administer anesthesia cut open the breast and remove piece tissue More recently FNA has emerged less invasive less painful and less expensive alternative surgical breast biopsy its name suggests breast FNA involves inserting small needle into the breast and suctioning cells into syringe The procedure takes only minutes and does not require anesthesia THE PROBLEM FNA SUBJECTIVITY Until recently however interpretation FNA specimen has been highly subjective process that the absence firm objective diagnostic criteria relies heavily the training and experience the persons examining the tissue Although FNA has gained wide acceptance for the diagnosis cancer the thyroid and certain other organs clinicians treating breast cancer have usually preferred employ less subjective diagnostic procedures such breast biopsy When looking under microscope pieces breast biopsy tissue pathologists can examine the intact structure breast tissue and look for certain signs that provide definitive signs malignancy One such sign for instance call invasiveness the pathologist sees group cells invading into normal tissue that invasion itself sufficient indicator that cancer present The FNA technique though destroys the structure breast tissues and thus forces pathologists base their interpretation almost entirely the appearance the individual cells the sample Pathologists examining breast FNA specimen need evaluate number cell features such size shape and various nuclear characteristics However since single one these features itself able yield unequivocal diagnosis malignancy pathologists have had subjectively weigh these various features order arrive diagnosis instances when the various cell features point the same direction the diagnosis malignant benign clear cut other instances though when features point different directions some suggesting malignant and others suggesting benign different observers might arrive different verdicts depending how they choose weigh the conflicting pieces evidence the face such potential for uncertainty and the consequences wrong diagnosis clinicians have been reluctant rely FNA for diagnosing breast cancer PROSPECTING FOR CANCER during chance encounter with Olvi Mangasarian professor the Computer Sciences department Madison described him the frustrations that had encountered trying find more objective way interpreting FNA specimens realized that problem was analogous linear programming problem had studied some years earlier while working the oil industry the problem where drill for oil Like evaluating FNA samples for cancer deciding where drill for oil involves finding way weigh number factors such geological features single one which can definitively predict whether not one will find oil solve his oil prospecting problem Mangasarian developed method call multisurface pattern separation which have now adapted for use with FNA samples essence the method begins with mathematically modelling the cytological features such size shape that need evaluate order determine whether not FNA sample malignant Next train the computer with data from two sets FNA samples for which already know the diagnosis one set benign samples and second set malignant samples During this machine process iteratively build portions fence between the two data sets until have completely fenced off the two data sets from each other Once have trained the computer can then enter data from unknown FNA sample The computer determines which side the fence the sample falls and makes the appropriate diagnosis malignant benign The computer also calculates probability malignancy which serves quantitative measure the degree which the computer certain its diagnosis IMAGE ANALYSIS Using digital image analysis techniques developed Nick Street Computer Science graduate student have now largely automated our computerized system for interpreting FNA samples look under microscope find suitable views the sample and use video camera attached the microscope record the images The computer then digitizes the video pictures and stores the data computer files run FNA analysis the computer program reconstructs the digitized microscopic image and displays the computer screen The computer operator simply uses mouse trace out rough outlines the nuclei and the computer does the rest desired the operator can trace out more nuclei remove nuclei that have already been traced out and then return the analysis FINDINGS AND RESULTS Our first goal has been make the diagnosis breast cancer from FNA samples more objective and accurate than has previously been possible have now succeeded developing highly accurate diagnostic system that requires only modest level expertise operate now have training set FNA samples and calculate that the system will correctly diagnose breast FNA samples the time practice the system has correctly diagnosed the last samples that have tested Our second goal has been develop objective method determining prognosis for those patients whom our diagnostic program identifies having breast cancer that accurately predict the likelihood that their cancer will recur regards this goal are still relatively early stage development only have samples our training set Although are encouraged our results date still need add more samples our training set and improve the program accuracy One the key findings from our studies has been the discovery that with our computer program nuclear features nuclear grade are more accurate determining prognosis than are determinations prognosis based the traditional measures tumor size and axillary node status Our research may thus have significant impact the current practice surgeon performing axillary lymph node dissection the time mastectomy for prognostic purposes Presently determination whether breast cancer has spread into patient axillary lymph nodes considered important factor establishing prognosis patients with tumor spread axillary lymph nodes node positive have higher likelihood tumor recurrence than those without tumor spread into axillary lymph nodes node negative Patients with node positive tumors tend also have earlier recurrences and general worse than patients with node negative tumors Data from our research however have indicated that patient nodal status node positive node negative provides new additional information about prognosis beyond that which already available from FNA biopsy When use FNA data alone run our prognostic program the results are just accurate when run the program using FNA data plus information nodal status and tumor size That have found that analysis patient FNA sample alone provides all the information about prognosis that need and thus that performing axillary lymph node dissection solely for prognostic purposes unnecessary Should studies other institutions confirm our findings many breast cancer patients the future could spared the necessity undergoing axillary lymph node biopsy FUTURE DIRECTIONS are now seeking collaborate with other institutions validate our computer program using their FNA samples have not patented our program and are willing provide copies our program those researchers who sign collaborative agreements with recently analyzed breast FNA slides from UCLA and were gratified find that correctly diagnosed them all are are also interested expanding our computerized interpretative method other organs besides breasts have had good early results with thyroid cancer and also believe our approach could prove particularly useful for evaluating lymphomas Last modified
