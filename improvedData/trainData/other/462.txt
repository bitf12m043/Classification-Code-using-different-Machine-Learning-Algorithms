methods forge new software tools for creating scientific software Robotics and Vision Lab Focuses the topics machine vision navigation and tracking robotic manipulation distributed and cooperative robotics microelectromechanical systems planning and control uncertainty and error and geometric algorithms NuPrl system that implements constructive theory types NuPrl provides both formal system mathematics and programming language allows the user express wide variety proof and program building methods metalevel programs the system and use these construct mathematical theorems and evaluate their computational content HyTech HyTech automatic tool for the analysis embedded systems HyTech computes the condition under which linear hybrid system satisfies temporal logic requirement Horus The Horus project has developed modular and extensible process group communication system addressing the requirements wide variety robust distributed applications Project The Computer Science Technical Report project ARPA funded consortium the top five computer science departments Berkeley CMU Cornell MIT and Stanford and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives CNRI The project goals are further research the electronic publication technical reports over the Internet and make available the existing library technical reports the member universities Project Zeno Focuses multimedia systems technologies including video file servers network transport protocols multimedia user interface toolkits and video special effects Information Capture and Access The information capture and access research group works ways that computers can locate information the ever increasing volume online data determine its structure and extract the information for human users Cluster Computing Net

ProgramGraduate ProgramsCourse OfferingsFinancial AssistanceCS Dept Admission Graduate Study undergraduate degree the minimal requirement for admission graduate study Students are admitted graduate program one the following three types status Full graduate status when all admission requirements are met Provisional graduate status when some admission requirements are not inadequately met Temporary graduate status take specific graduate level courses for one term All students except those with temporary status must apply either the program the program Students admitted the program are eligible complete the requirements for that degree they wish transfer the program they must apply the Admissions Committee which will make its decision based the student performance the program and the recommendations the faculty Full Graduate Status student admitted degree program with full status she has minimally earned bachelor degree has maintained grade point average least and has completed the following courses their equivalents student admitted degree program with full graduate status she has earned least degree maintained grade point average least and completed minimally selection courses the following topical areas the corresponding Pitt course numbers are indicated Computer Science one course each Discrete Structures Information Data Structures Computer Organization Assembly Language Theory Languages Systems Mathematics the following the three course calculus sequence Math course linear algebra Math course probability statistics requiring calculus prerequisite Stat Provisional Graduate Status student may admitted the degree program with provisional status his her qualifications are minimally deficient Such students will advanced full graduate status after removal the identified deficiences Students are expected gain full graduate status the time they complete credits equivalently one academic year full time graduate studies Students with provisional status are not allowed hold teaching assistantship Temporary Graduate Status This status allows student take graduate level courses for one term without enrolling graduate program Temporary status appropriate for student who wants take one more specific courses for which she has the necessary qualifications has deficiencies background low grades fails meet the deadline for filing official application for admission but has met all the requirements for admission into degree program with full graduate status student interested applying for such special temporary status must first obtain written permission from the faculty member teaching the course interest and then follow all the procedures for admission graduate degree program Application Materials All application materials should sent the specified deadlines the Graduate Admissions Committee the address given below Graduate Admissions Committee Department Computer Science University Pittsburgh Pittsburgh The materials should all hard copy form mail inquiries about Pitt graduate programs may sent grad info pitt edu inquiries about the status application may sent admit status pitt edu Deadlines February for Fall admission with financial aid March for Fall admission October for Spring admission Application Materials Submitted the Applicant The following materials must fully completed the applicant and submitted one mailing Regular Application Form All applicants must complete this form Departmental Supplemental Information Form All applicants must complete both sides this form Letter Application goal statement All applicants must write letter qualification themselves The letter should addressed the Graduate Admissions Committee Usually this letter contains degree objective reasons for pursuing studies computer science and any additional information about qualifications and experience that are not covered adequately the application form Application Fee The fee paid bank draft money order Personal checks are also acceptable provided they are drawn bank The check money order payable University Pittsburgh application will considered without the prepaid application fee Supplementary Application Form Only applicants who are not citizens the United States must complete this form After foreign student has been admitted all subsequent visa related work handled the Foreign Students Office the University Application Materials Submitted Others These materials are sent directly the Graduate Admissions Committee the address given above The applicant name must match with that given the main application form Transcripts Grades The grade transcripts the applicant should sent directly the Department all schools which the applicant has attended since leaving high school These must originals and cases certain foreign universities must include English translations that are formally certified the university registrar equivalent official Transcripts official grade reports are not required for non university courses Three Reference Forms Recommendation Letters These should completed written persons who can evaluate chances the applicant success graduate school general the following individuals decreasing order preference are suitable professors applicant upper level computer science mathematics courses and current former employment supervisors The completed reference forms obtained from the Department letters should sent directly the Department the evaluating persons Standard Test Scores GRE scores are required advanced GRE score Computer Science strongly recommended For foreign applicant TOEFL score also required All scores must reported directly the Educational Testing Service the Department Computer Science Graduate ProgramsCourse OfferingsFinancial
