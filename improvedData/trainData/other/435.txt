Science Department News SummaryAug This news was taken from the College Science and Math Newsletter Department News section Welcome those you who found through that medium Each faculty member has home page some the students Our current brochures and other documents also are available encourage all alumni place their own Home Pages here well plan add more features and information coming months Check back every once while The past year was exciting and productive for the department beta test site for Intel products the department works with Intel the area distance conferencing and recently began building closer relationships with Great Plains Software and Cargill The introduction closed student laboratories into our starting course sequence received excellent reviews and has helped many students those courses build better and more satisfying foundations for success Computer Science you have comments suggestions the undergraduate curriculum please let know The graduate programs continue high demand with six doctoral graduates and nine master graduates this year Plans expand distance education offerings continue Possibilities include offering the doctoral degree through variety media including computer conferencing mail and ROM Department faculty continue publish widely More than papers appeared wide variety journals and conference proceedings The department first major fundraising project was success Every faculty member contributed raise our endowment for undergraduate student scholarships nearly Ron Vetter Bill Perrizo Paul Juell Valery Soloviev and Ken Nygard began NSF funded project develop state the art high speed networking laboratory around ATM switch Perrizo and Vetter continued their work multi state project build resource centers accessible the citizens the upper Midwest and Perrizo serves the half time university dean research while Vetter associate editor IEEE Computer Nygard Juell Xudong and Valery Soloviev continue their funded research projects and Vasant Ubhaya conducts technical research with faculty members from Pennsylvania State University Texas and and University Waterloo Vasant Ubhaya also organized and chaired invited sessions and presented papers conferences the University Michigan Ann Arbor and Texas and Ken Magel continued his research object oriented testing methods with several graduate students Bob Gammill continued push the department toward low cost easily used UNIX based local area networks John Martin completed the revision for second edition his book descrete structures Bruce Erickson and Mark Pavicic are pioneering the efforts the department introduce the undergraduate curriculum Juell Nygard and several other faculty are researching World Wide Web activities The department web address www ndsu nodak edu William Perrizo receives grant for high speed database studyBill Perrizo professor computer science will research client server databases high speed networks with his grant Military decision makers depend more and more computerized management information systems both for gathering data and for making sure that data secure multiple levels Perrizo says says the grant will allow him develop and evaluate methods for distributed client server database management over high speed fiber optical networks Ken Nygard track school districts North Dakota schools range from one room schoolhouses the far west sprawling growing schools like Grand Forks Red River High School the east rural areas where population declining there are mergers and consolidations every year School districts are constant state flux For many years district boundaries were recorded legal documents and penciled onto various maps district superintendents Consistency was rare and was difficult obtain statewide information concerning school district boundaries The situation was helped significantly with the development School Maps geographic information system software NDSU computer science professor Ken Nygard and his assistants developed School Maps software from scratch and first used study transportation issues That led mapping school districts and now expanding include wide variety analyses Work with the school districts remains top priority Nygard research associate Mike Haugrud and their research assistants update the districts once year usually July small job according research assistant Michael Greene was charge organizing nine filing boxes full correspondence proposals and legal documents regarding mergers and changes throughout the state before the map was adjusted for the school year Nygard says one reason School Maps important the way puts school issues quantitative level rather than emotional one People North Dakota are enormously sensitive this issue Nygard says regard school mergers and closures Schools are considered the lifeblood town Without them people feel the town would wither With the realization that mergers are necessary action times research assistant Jocher Layher Fulbright scholar from Germany developing program that will measure the efficiency school districts Nygard says the program has many possible uses similar program North Carolina reduced the number school buses the state several hundred within the first year use controversial program but you can see the benefit Nygard and his colleagues are proud the way School Maps can use simple algebraic equations make all kinds combinations the maps Haugrud can for instance subtract the school census from the census and determine which districts are losing and which are gaining population The districts are color coded make the visual even clearer This kind presentation information tremendous improvement over the past when page full numbers and statistics was the only output easily available The bright colors and combinations School Maps are much more effective lawmakers citizens and school boards great tool for analyzing trends can define the difference between new and old data and display that map bar graph pie chart Nygard says These capabilities were used the last two legislative sessions statewide education issues were addressed The public can access and download School Maps from its website ndsun ndsu nodak edu www SMAPS The North Dakota Department Public Instruction works cooperation with Nygard and has instituted School Maps their Bismarck offices The program also accessible from their web site Date Mon Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Wed Aug GMT Content length David Comment Form You can send mail
