IMPORTANT for problem you should look the postscript the handout and not the photocopied handouts class since the images were blackened out the photocopying process Test Images You should make your own test images addition the ones here The problem set finalized you need only submit the results for these two images below left and right random dot stereogram seen Fig assignment left and right images from stereo camera You should submit the results starting from zeroed disparity map and using this starting map you are using linux IBM you should use this big endian short image The map was generated using simple windowing sum squared differences method sure use value Delta otherwise this disparity map will have the wrong size Using the ADT image libraries The following versions the library are available SunOS available the dept machines robotlab new lib libadt with the appropriate header files robotlab new include adt NOT use DSVR your command line Sunlab located jmiller libadt with header files jmiller include Other locations library and header files Solaris available the dept machines robotlab new lib libadt svr with the appropriate header files robotlab new include adt sure include DSVR your command line Sunlab you won need the Solaris version Other locations library and header files Linux Here the ELF library and tarfile containing the header files AIX thanks Christoper Kline here copy the email sent Windows changed mind the chances easily getting Visual code compile with another compiler minimal you want use gcc then maybe can talk debates jmiller cornell edu Problem Set MINI FAQ the maximum absolute value disparity then the disparity image should lose only pixels each side because the Cyclopean model not mentioned the assignment This would yield disparity image that Yes mixed this one should only pixels each side when using the cyclopean model you correct the mistake sure double the Delta constant when using the tree images that the disparity map gave you will the right size What the termination condition When the average the demon energy near zero The demon energy can temporarily zero but the average will not zero unless the system near equilibrium Since the average near zero the standard deviation has near zero and therefore the ration the two nearly see equation Barnard Paper The termination condition NOT zero energy for the system any interesting answer should have non zero energy How can make own test images Answer write program generate the images Answer generate them matlab there are set matlab files jmiller prog matlab robotlab read the documentation simple image rand background rand moving object copy background copy forground copy forground shift imSaveF IMAGE GRAY left pgm save images note multiply imSaveF IMAGE GRAY right pgm since gray images have values and rand generates values range What does ergodic mean good answer this was recently posted sci image processing What are areas have optimization

Sep GMT STL Manual and SourceStandard Template Library Manual and SourceLast updated The Standard Template Library STL was developed Labs and has been adopted the ANSI Standards Committe for inclusion the standard library Some compilers are unable compile the source code for this library provided here you are using GNU then comes with compatible version STL libstdc you should use that version STL Microsoft Visual also ships with STL bundled Borland greater should have problems compiling the STL source code here you are Unix get the self extracting shell archive shar files you are get the zip
