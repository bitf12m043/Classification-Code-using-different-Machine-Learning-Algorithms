Computer Sciences DepartmentCS Bart MillerLecture Notes for will use these note the lectures for You should print out each week lectures and review the notes before class Bring these class that you won have spend much time during lecture writing This the first semester that using the Web distribute notes That means that have convert them from another word processing package not all the notes will ready the start the semester will announce class when new sections are ready Note sections marked with are not yet ready You will get unpredictable output you view print them Section Course
