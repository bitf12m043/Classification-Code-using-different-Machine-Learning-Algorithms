department covers almost all computer science fields The descriptions here are just sample research activities Christos FaloutsosSearching content multimedia databases examines fast methods for approximate matching Typical queries are follows collection product photographs find products that look like tennis shoes collection medical rays find ones that look like the ray the current patient and list the corresponding diagnoses The main idea extract features from objects interest typically with the help domain expert thus mapping each object into point dimensional feature space Subsequently can use state the art database technologies like trees store and retrieve these dimensional points The philosophy provide quick and dirty filter eliminate the vast majority irrelevant objects Some false alarms are acceptable because they can easily discarded elaborate test even the user already have sets features for color images shapes and time series are experimenting with modern signal processing techniques such the discrete wavelet transform for sound and images with mathematical morphology for shapes and with the discrete cosine transform for stock price time series The method generic and can applied for ANY collection multimedia objects long there are some good feature extraction functions Potential applications include Medical databases For diagnostic research and teaching purposes patient records can supplemented with electrocardiograms ray images MRI scans etc Edu tainment Students researchers and video demand customers can search databases video clips art images etc Scientific databases Collections NASA photographs meteorological geological maps etc can used aid forecasting weather etc Electronic commerce Users want search electronic catalogues with product photographs addition other attributes price maker availability etc Pete Keleher Spring Keleher won NSF CAREER award which will fund research high performance synchronization distributed systems Software distributed shared memory DSM systems provide the abstraction shared memory networks workstations and distributed memory machines such the Paragon Unfortunately the latencies for global operations either environment are several orders magnitude more expensive than tightly coupled multiprocessors The result that current DSMs perform well for only restricted class applications Sparks protocol construction library that will allow improved performance DSM systems within few percent tightly coupled multiprocessors currently being designed Sparks abstractions will allow clean and systematic explorations the design space high level synchronization operations rather than proposing and implementing new operations hoc fashion Sparks basic abstraction the coherence history object that summarizes past coherence actions shared segments The emphasis more creating and investigating the abstractions that make broad variety optimizations possible rather than the individual optimizations themselves However the performance gains allowed the synchronization types created via the Sparks library will thoroughly quantified Chau Wen Tseng Chau Wen Tseng won NSF CAREER award Spring which will allow him pursue research the area efficient machine independent programming high performance multipro cessors Parallel computing can provide the next great leap the computation power scientists and engineers need solve many important problems Multiprocessor workstations are becoming common and already provide valuable resource for scientists areas such physics biology and chemistry Experience has shown that simply finding parallelism not always sufficient for obtaining good performance from today multiprocessors The goal this project develop advanced compiler analysis data and computation decompositions thread placement communication synchronization and memory system effects needed order take advantage performance critical elements modern parallel architectures Locality and interprocessor communication are the key performance issues for multiprocessors achieve high performance the compiler will apply communication analysis determine sources commu nication and guide optimizations for locality and communication The compiler follows two basic guidelines First uses compilation techniques for message passing machines retain most the benefits explicit messages Second exploits architectural and operating system support available shared memory multiprocessors prove flexibility and performance novel characteristic the compiler will its ability take advantage the multiple coherence protocols and hybrid message passing support found software Distributed Shared Memory DSM systems and Flexible Shared Memory FSM machines Rich Gerber The TimeWare group currently carrying out projects the areas real time software development automated verification and digital video systems The real time software project called end end design its objective automatically map high level end end timing requirements into fully realized multi streamed implementation Real time designs are entered terms task graphs possessing end end requirements delay jitter etc and intermediate data rates and buffer sizes are then maintained parametrically terms equations based the high level design Once the hardware specific details are known the application integrated and the intermediate parameters are automatically calibrated achieve the end end requirements The payoff that software designers can have the buffer sizes and intermediate data rates assigned for them thereby minimizing the degree low level tuning required The verification project consists automatically checking large specifications for subtle safety and liveness errors compiling individual tasks into simple state transition models and compositionally checking the entire program for nonconformance its specification Thus the verification done iterative piece piece manner that local analysis first performed the individual tasks and tasks are composed more analysis carried out This allows progressive deletion states that are known disprove the specification that the generated state space kept minimum Work media systems includes applying static and dynamic tuning solutions help master and then play back stored digital video Static tuning takes place during the production phase the process adjusting the video intrinsic quality before exported The group has studied results many different static tuning alternatives altering key parameters and then charting their effects playback Dynamic tuning occurs during playback itself the idea process video stream smoothly and deterministically possible level software built the group supports this periodically estimates the playback requirements particular video and then allocates buffers prefetch window sizes bandwidth and CPU utilization that the computer can best meet the video requirements This technique significantly outperformed the movie playing procedures supplied Apple Quicktime API Hanan Samet The representation spatial data important issue computer graphics computer vision geographic information systems GIS and image processing Once the representation has been chosen users must given the ability access and most importantly perform operations The utility this data maximized can integrated into database management system This difficult problem most conventional systems use today are mainly designed deal with alphanumeric data Our approach solving this problem based the observation that the problem really one sorting The difference from other approaches the realization that the geometric data must sorted the basis its extent the fact that occupies space and with respect the space that occupies This instead parametrizing the spatial data and treating points higher dimensional space which what done many researchers Representations that take the extent the data into account enable perform proximity queries efficiently are working the integration non point representations spatial and image data well nonspatial data into conventional database management system This research backed the QUILT GIS which working geographic information system and the SAND system for integrating spatial and nonspatial data principal goal able extend this system handle arbitrary spatial indices rather than just arbitrary spatial data types Another goal the development query optimizer which takes into account characteristics the spatial data and chooses efficient execution plan for the queries One the main results this research has been the development browser that enables posing queries that combine spatial and nonspatial data Most noteworthy the user interface which enables spatial queries specified graphically instead requiring the use SQL Work also being conducted image databases deal with symbolic image and the development data parallel representations and algorithms for spatial
