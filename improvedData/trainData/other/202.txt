involved linear state based planners This paper presents SCOPE system for learning search control rules that improve the performance partial order planner SCOPE integrates explanation based and inductive learning techniques acquire control rules for partial order planner Learned rules are the form selection heuristics that help the planner choose between competing plan refinements Specifically SCOPE learns domain specific control rules for version the UCPOP planning algorithm The resulting system shown produce significant speedup two different planning domains Integrating

tool for automating wide variety tasks Control knowledge guides planner find solutions quickly and crucial for efficient planning most domains Machine learning techniques enable planning system automatically acquire domain specific search control knowledge for different applications Past approaches learning control information have usually employed explanation based learning EBL generate control rules Unfortunately EBL alone often produces overly complex rules that actually decrease rather than improve overall planning efficiency This paper presents novel learning approach for control knowledge acquisition that integrates explanation based learning with techniques from inductive logic programming our learning system SCOPE EBL used constrain inductive search for control heuristics that help planner choose between competing plan refinements SCOPE one the few systems address learning control information for newer partial order planners Specifically this proposal describes how

approach Future research will performed three main areas First SCOPE learning algorithm will extended include additional techniques such constructive induction and rule utility analysis Second SCOPE will more thoroughly tested several real world planning domains have been identified possible testbeds and more depth comparisons will drawn between SCOPE and other competing approaches Third SCOPE

which uniformly incorprate syntactic and semantic constraints parse sentences into case role representations Initial experiments show that this approach able construct accurate parsers which generalize well novel sentences and significantly outperform previous approaches learning case role mapping based connectionist techniques Planned extensions the general framework and the specific

assignments will handed online The file server for the Vectra the lab has special handin directory for you where you will copy your source code files executable files and any related data files Your files are timestamped with the current time and date when you copy them your handin directory This timestamp will used check they were handed time whether late day penalties apply File Names Please use the following file name convention when you copy files your handin directory This greatly simplifies determining which files should graded for each assignment Your FORTRAN source code files should named program for For example program for program for Your compiled executable files should named program exe For example program exe program exe Copying Files Your Handin Directory copy files your handin directory type the following DOS command copy filename handin bestor your login name filename For example copy program for handin bestor jthomas program for copy program exe handin bestor jthomas program exe confirm that your files were copied over you can display list all the files your handin direcory typing the DOS command dir handin bestor your login name Notes IMPORTANT Make sure you copy the correct versions your program files because these are what will graded not copy any files your handin directory until you have completely finished the assignment Otherwise you but end handing the assignment late then earlier incomplete version your program may get graded accidentally before you hand the final version you have problems copying files your handin directory ask
