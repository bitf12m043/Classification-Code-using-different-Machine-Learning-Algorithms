graduate students Computer Science Education Nell DaleAnchir Angel Syang Debra Lynn BurtonCheng Chih WuVicki Lynn AlmstrumYoungju KimA Quantitative Student Model for Intelligent Tutoring Systems Student Programming Ability Anchir Angel Syang Intelligent tutoring systems are made the subject matter taught student model the method representing what student knows and does not know and tutoring strategies The purpose this research was develop quantitative model measure programming abilities students who have completed the first course computer science This model could then used the student model intelligent tutoring system The framework the study was analyze and compare several models including four from classical testing theory and one from item response theory Performance data was based the responses students questions covering the programming concepts The course grade prior the final exam was used the basis for comparing the different models The results showed that the model proposed the study feasible and could used develop computerized adaptive test based item response theory Such test could form the basis for student model intelligent tutoring system for computer programming The Effect Closed Laboratory Activities the Comprehension Five Concepts and the Perception Effectiveness the Course Second Semester Computer Science Course Debra Lynn Burton There are several possible definitions closed laboratory for this study the following definition was used assignment completed within specified time period room computers reserved for this purpose The issue addressed the research was Are closed laboratory activities effective improving the comprehension computer science concepts The concepts measured this experiment were algorithm complexity stacks queues recursion and sorting The experiment was conducted classes where there were large lecture sections and smaller weekly discussion sections For five the fifteen weeks the semester half the discussion sections did closed laboratory activities the week concepts while the other half did comparable paper and pencil exercise pretest was used remove bias due initial differences comprehension students completed the study The results showed significant difference the comprehension the five concepts between the students who participated the closed laboratory activities and those students who did paper and pencil exercises Conceptual Models and Individual Cognitive Learning Styles Teaching Recursion Novices Cheng Chih Most novice students have trouble learning recursion The purpose this study was examine whether the method presentation concrete abstract affected how students learned recursion and determine the role played the students own learning styles The sample was made students enrolled course Each student took the Kolb Learning Styles Inventory which categorizes the student cognitive learning style concrete abstract Two models presenting recursion were devised one concrete and one abstract The students were tested over the material immediately following the lecture two weeks later and six weeks later The results showed that concrete models were superior abstract models and abstract learners did better than concrete learners interaction effect was found between student learning style and the presentation model Limitations the Understanding Mathematical Logic Novice Computer Science Students Vicki Lynn Almstrum This study sought objective evidence that computer science students have more difficulty understanding concepts the subdomain mathematical logic than they other areas computer science The data used for the study were the multiple choice questions five Advanced Placement Examinations Computer Science There were two main parts this study determining which questions related logic and comparing student performance those questions related logic and those questions with little relationship logic Thirty eight university and high school instructors most whom taught the level participated content analysis the questions The results the content analysis were used partition the questions into those strongly related logic and those not strongly related logic The questions the strongly related partition had lower means and standard deviations than the questions the not strongly related partition The difficulty distributions defined the two sets items were not the same These results substantiate the hypothesis that computer science concepts related logic are generally more difficult for novice students The Reasoning Ability and Achievement College Level Students Enrolled Logic Class Computer Science Youngju Kim The Propositional Logic Test PLT item instrument used measure student ability use the propositional operations conditional reasoning This research considered the following questions What the relationship between student score the PLT and his her achievement logic class and does taking logic class improve student score the PLT The PLT was given the first and last days class logic course designed for computer science majors The first day PLT score predicted the midterm grade and the final course grade Although the average score the PLT improved from the first day the last day there was statistical difference before and after taking logic class Books Main Profile Students MailNell Dale Westlake Austin fax office This document was

the shelf hardware large parallel computers Implemented preliminary version shared memory across COW workstation nodes that supports coarse grain sharing precursor our upcoming fine grain shared

Barton Miller bart wisc edu Background The national defense and other key sectors such education health care and commerce increasingly benefit from and relying upon massive computational power Parallel computers constructed from array conventional computers offer cost effective approach buying CPU cycles Although the cost advantage clear getting the computers work together effectively requires better methods for cooperatively sharing information and identifying and mitigating information traffic jams Goals This project addresses both concerns Effective information sharing must permit programmers tailor program sharing the problem being solved rather than being constrain the limit options built into system Our system supports message passing like postal mail fine grain shared memory like reading over each other shoulders and hybrid combinations the two Our system can implemented low high end parallel computers programs can reused across wide range system For more information this part the project click here The second goal project improve techniques for mitigating information traffic jams what computer specialists call performance debugging Traditional tools for performance debugging have not scaled large parallel machines because difficult decide advance what measure and what detail Our tools transcend this problem supporting dynamic instrumentation that allows measurement activity adapt the tool current hypothesis for the information traffic jam location For more information this part the project click here Participants Support The principal
