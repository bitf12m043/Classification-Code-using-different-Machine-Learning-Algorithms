appointment Office Computer Science mail andreas columbia edu Course Description Programming Languages first course programming However prior programming experience assumed From the course catalog description for Introduction programming language Each section devoted specific language Intended only for those who are already fluent least one programming language This five week course and will meet from Wednesday September Monday October classes Texts IACU Wang Paul Introduction ANSI Unix Wadsworth TCPL Kernigham Brian Ritchie Dennis The Programming Language Prentice Hall Only IACU required Both are available Papyrus Bookstore Broadway Street Reserve copies are placed the Enginneering library well Course Requirements and Grading There will four homework assignments and one final exam All homeworks and final have the same weight Homework assignments are handed out each Wednesday and are due one week later the BEGINNING the class There are extensions however partial credit will considered for all incomplete work Assignments cannot accepted after answers have been made available During any lag time between the due date and the posting answers homeworks will accepted but will marked late Late homeworks will penalized you disagree with grade submit your grievance WRITING the grader responsible documenting the merits your case The final exam will given the last day class Monday October will closed book exam Programming Policy You will need AcIS computer account All programming may developed any machine However the programs must run AcIS machines Only those programs submitted electronically the submit program the AcIS machines will accepted and graded critically important that all submitted program listings and executions thoroughly documented Further all documentation must internal included the comments the source file Good programming style will account for substantial portion the grade assigned the programming assignments Make sure you provide adequate test cases indicate the correcteness and robustness your approaches general the failure grader understand your work appreciate the thoroughness its testing will considered your error Homework Submissions For each assignment you are required make two homework submissions The first hardcopy paper submission the class folder the department front office The second electronic submission The submit handout describes how submit your assignments from AcIS account Note that both submissions must occur the deadline the due date The hardcopy paper submissions your assignments will used write comments and make corrections your programs and will returned you The electronic submissions will used test your programs Class Homepage class homepage http www columbia edu has been created for class use This will the primary means electronic announcements including corrections hints and extensions Copies all handouts including homework assignments and solutions will made available through this resource Class Newsgroup AcIS has set class account the cunix machines From your account you can visit the class directory changing directory class newsgroup columbia spring sec has been created for

project you can devote the entire course time contrast most other course projects are done the last month concurrently with lecture activities The project goal for you and your partners explore aspect Java Java implementations deeply that you learn more about doing research and teach the class and your professors something new You will graded how well your team define problem surveys previous work designs and conducts experiments and presents your results See the course page for possible topics recommend three partners and require least two provide you with experience working with team which valuable research projects and product groups Your tasks Project proposals due via email both markhill and larus Friday October Proposals turned earlier will get earlier feedback Proposals should about one two pages long and include description your topic statement why you think the topic interesting important description the methods you will use evaluate your ideas and references least three sources information pertinent your topic Midterm status meetings during the week November You will meet with one both the professors for about minutes informally present the status your project and weekly plan for completing Details for scheduling meetings will made available later via the class mailing list Project talks during week December will divide the last few lectures into minute ish conference style talks All group members should deliver part the talk The talk should present highlights the final report including the problem motivation results conclusions and possible future work Time limits will enforced let everyone present Please practice your talk Have plan for what slides skip you get behind Click here for oral presentation advice Details for scheduling talks will made available later via the class mailing list Project reports are due Larus mailbox Wednesday December Reports turned before Friday December will accepted but will graded letter grade lower goes goes Reports will not accepted after Friday December Reports should consist abstract body and optional appendices The abstract should summarize the contributions the report one two paragraphs The length the body should the equivalent pages double spaced point Additional supporting material any length can put appendices However only promise read the body and skim the appendices
