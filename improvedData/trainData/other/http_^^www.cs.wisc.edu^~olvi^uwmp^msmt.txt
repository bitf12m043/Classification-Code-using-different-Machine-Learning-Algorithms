Let and finite disjoint point sets dimensional Euclidean space represented the and matrices and respectively The MSM algorithm generates decision tree representing the planes needed separate the sets and Each non leaf node the tree plane that further separates and Each leaf node contains points either exclusively prescribed tolerance For detailed description the MSM algorithm see Mangasarian Mathematical Programming Neural Networks ORSA Journal Computing Vol Fall pages Table Contents Generation the Decision Tree Displaying the Decision Tree Pruning Cross Validation Storage Decision Trees ExamplesGeneration the Decision Tree The MATLAB representation the matrices and from now denoted and must placed the MATLAB environment This can done either actually entering them hand placing them file and loading the file into the MATLAB environment The decision tree technically represented matrix the MATLAB environment This matrix representation the decision tree must generated generate this matrix call the MATLAB environment msmt tree max depth tolerance certainty factor min points the above expression the various symbols are defined follows MATLAB representation the matrices and max depth maximum allowable depth the decision tree must greater than equal this argument not given then max depth set default some huge positive integer tolerance percentage allowable error leaf node must between and this argument not given then tolerance set default certainty factor used pruning algorithm see Pruning this argument not given certainty factor the tree not pruned min points used point pruning algorithm see Pruning this argument not given min points the tree not pruned See msmt tree file Displaying the Decision Tree The decision tree generated the call above can displayed graphically calling the following routine within the MATLAB environment disp tree where matrix representing the decision tree the MATLAB environment matrix representing the point set the MATLAB environment matrix representing the point set the MATLAB environment The following example the graphical representation the decision tree using Wisconsin Breast Cancer data Each node the tree numbered the MATLAB environment the following information provided For each non leaf node Equation the plane given theta Number points set this node Number points set this node For each leaf node Identification that the node leaf node Number points set this node Number points set this node See disp tree file Pruning Pruning removes potentially unnecessary subtrees from the decision tree This MATLAB implementation allows for pruning using different algorithms Error based pruning from Programs for Machine Learning and Minimum misclassified points algorithm Error Based Pruning prune the given decision tree using the error based pruning algorithm outlined Programs for Machine Learning call the MATLAB environment prune tree certainty factor where matrix representing the decision tree the MATLAB environment MATLAB representation matrices and certainty factor real number between and including and Smaller values certainty factor will result more pruning and vice versa for larger values NOTE Suggested value for certainty factor The decision tree may also pruned this algorithm when the tree generated giving value for certainty factor the call msmt tree max depth tolerance certainty factor min points For detailed description the pruning algorithm see Ross Quinlan Programs for Machine Learning Morgan Kaufman Publishers San Mateo California See prune tree file Minimum Misclassified Points Pruning The minimum misclassified points algorithm works follows integer number allowable misclassified points given plane generated that splits node and has less than this number allowable misclassified points this decision node made into leaf node the plane generated splits more than this allowable number misclassified points this decision node remains This pruning algorithm can called the MATLAB environment prune tree points min points where matrix representing the decision tree the MATLAB environment MATLAB representation matrices and min points the minimum allowable number misclassified points decision node The decision tree may pruned using this algorithm when generated giving value for min points the call msmt tree max depth tolerance certainty factor min points See prune tree points file Cross Validation The performance the MSM algorithm given data set may tested cross validation The cross validation procedure works follows The sets and are equally divided into given number groups num groups for each group decision tree constructed using num groups groups The tree then tested using the group set aside The algorithm returns percent percentage correctly classified points the MSM algorithm confusion matrix see cross val file ave planes average number planes needed the separation The cross validation procedure can initiated making the following call the MATLAB environment percent confusion matrix ave planes cross val num groups max depth tolerance certainty factor min points where MATLAB representation matrices and numgroups number groups use cross validation max depth tolerance certainty factor min points See Generating the Decision Tree See cross val file Storage Decision Trees decision tree may written any specified file using the following call the MATLAB environment msmt write file filename where matrix representing the decision tree the MATLAB environment filename name the file written NOTE this name must enclosed single quotes Once tree has been written can retrieved and put back the MATLAB environment with the following call the MATLAB environment msmt read file filename where filename name the file read NOTE this must enclosed single quotes the decision tree place the MATLAB environment matrix See msmt write file and msmt read file files Last modified Thu Jul Paul Bradley paulb wisc edu
