metal the appropriate shape into outlet you will get Volts between themA specification details what the consumer can assume about the component which what the producer the power company must deliver You can think specification legally binding contractHow the power company generates the power not part the specificationHydro power Coal hamsters treadmillsSoftware specificationsFunctions are software components software producers are implementors and consumers are clients When defining function you are implementor when using function you are client function specification consists its signature and its correctness specification exp for int exp int int return exp signature function taking two int and returning intcorrectness specification then exp will yield SignaturesThe number parameters that function takes together with their types and the type the result returns are its signature Note that the body the function doesn affect the signatureIn function application the number and type the arguments must match the signature exp wrongexp Hello wrongprintf exp wrongCorrectness SpecificationsA correctness specification states what function does without saying how does for consists precondition and postcondition this distinction will clearer few weeks The precondition restricts the permissible arguments The postcondition describes the result terms the arguments general correctness specification states the arguments function application satisfy the precondition then the application will yield value that satisfies the postcondition then exp will yield the precondition not satisfied the result not defined can anything diverge exp diverges for exp exp exp exp exp exp exp exp exp function should never called with arguments that not satisfy the precondition Because conditional expression non strict evaluating exp never calls exp inexp exp exp ImplementationsMany implementations can satisfy given specification int fourth int return int fourth int return square square int fourth int return exp The specification should not describe the implementation which the implementor has freedom change This why specifications are vital the design large programs Use Mathematical FunctionsCan use arbitrary mathematical functions specification but sure the mathematical functions are well defined for all arguments permitted the precondition minor flaw for because
