Robbert van Renesse started the activity that ultimately lead the design Horus the outset the project was perceived redesign the Isis group communication system Isis although successful was UNIX specific monolithic and hence inflexible and used protocols that have subsequently been improved upon Over the last five years Horus evolved beyond these initial goals becoming sophisticated group communication system with emphasis and properties considerably different from those its parent system Perhaps the best general overviews Horus can found the April issue Communications the ACM and the May issue Scientific American Many additional papers are available our online technical reports area Readers already familiar with group communication will best understand Horus general purpose communication architecture that also does very good job supporting the sorts process group applications for which Isis became popular Broadly Horus flexible and extensible process group communication system which the interfaces seen the application can varied conceal the system behind more conventional interfaces and which the actual properties the groups used membership communication events that affect the group can matched the specific needs the application application contains multiple subsystems with differing needs can create multiple superimposed groups with different properties each The resulting architecture unique being completely adaptable the groupware developer systems programmer pays only for properties that are specifically desired and can often use Horus introduce reliability replication completely transparent manner Users who wish treat Horus prebuilt system can take advantage its virtual synchrony model introduce replication coordination and fault tolerance into their applications Horus suitable for building high performance groupware applications and are now working real time applications notably the area telecommunications switch management Several interfaces are available for direct use Horus including toolkit named HOTS oriented towards programmers For users who wish develop new groupware protocols Horus can viewed group communication environment rather than collection prebuilt groupware solutions UNIX independent and permits the use several programming languages and Python single system Horus protocols are structured like stacks Lego blocks hence new protocols can developed adding new layers recombining existing ones Through dynamic run time layering Horus permits application adapt the protocols runs the environment which finds itself Much our research has been the issues associated with developing layered groupware protocols Over time Horus layers have become much simpler than expected and consequently lend themselves automatic verification This especially true for the Horus layers coded which are well suited analysis using the NuPrl system also Cornell research project combining simple layers complex semantics can supported Existing Horus protocol layers include implementation virtually synchronous process groups technique permitting consistent and fault tolerant data replication well protocols for parallel and multi media applications Considerable recent work has been done protocols for secure group computing and for real time applications Moreover Horus now point where the communication protocols can upgraded underneath running application without the need stop and restart the application Although layered protocol architectures often carry performance penalty Horus includes protocol accelerator that permits demonstrate excellent performance Horus supports CORBA request broker fault tolerant multi media toolkit fault tolerant WWW server and cooperative text editor the theoretical side the project has contributed significant body fundamental results the overall areas distributed fault tolerance consistency security and private communication group communication systems Current work includes study how properties can proved for composed stacks consisting multiple layers basic theoretical work virtual synchrony and study systems that combine real time and logical consistency properties Looking the future believe that Horus will well matched the replication needs emerging Web applications such caching Web proxies Cornell students have implemented prototypes such systems successfully Horus can used Java communication protocol and appropriate for system management complex large scale internet settings Other likely application areas include transparent fault tolerance options for limited classes applications security and system monitoring and database replication The Horus software available for use research laboratories Commercial use the technology should possible late early
