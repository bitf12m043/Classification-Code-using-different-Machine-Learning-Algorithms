debug multi file and projects How design language independent algorithms and data structures How design application program interfaces for new code libraries How write simple code How networked client server computing works exemplified the World Wide Web Texts Eric Roberts The Art and Science Handouts Web pages Scheduling Note This course follows the schedule the McCormick School Engineering That means that classes will meet during reading week Computing Requirements the assignments you must have ready access one the following platforms compatible better with Borland Turbo preferrably version Macintosh preferrably better with Symantec THINK Unix machine with GNU and Windows with either the Athena Motif widget set addition matter which the platforms you you also need computer the Northwestern network with Web browser preferrably Netscape better the most recent release Mosaic FTP program FTP Unix Fetch the Macintosh FTP Client for Windows the Course notes announcements assignments and code that you must have will available only via the network Topics Basic programming language concepts Constants integers floats strings and variables Reading and writing data Expressions arithmetic logical Control statements iteration for while branching switch Functions calling defining prototyping Files Basic computer science concepts Data structures strings arrays pointers Algorithms and algorithm analysis Software development Libraries using defining interface and implementation Development environments files projects debuggers Program design Requirements analysis Algorithm and data structure design Modules and application program interfaces API Coding for maintainability Testing and debugging Programming the large Application concepts Graphics Graphical interactive interfaces Event driven programming Assignments and work load You learn doing There lot learn this course there lot doing While the basic concepts will taught the lectures and assessed the exams the real learning will occur the programming assignments This very time consuming course Comments Send mail Chris Riesbeck Date Tue Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last

ways the queen sciences because the most general attempt model the world via logical categories The most complicated entity model course the human mind distinct from the brain Before even attempting construct such model however worth asking whether given the constrains computer science such undertaking even feasible The justification for this project omnipresent throughout much the history philosophy beginning from Plato and Aristotle and culminating the present day Cartesian technical scientific world view The questioning such world view even ultimately ends affirmation the utmost importance are understand the limits and nature not only computer science and implication our entire sheaf techno rational assumptions but ourselves well The attempt overcome traditional metaphysics began perhaps with Fredrick Nietzsche and his questioning the prominence the notion truth and its relationship the self happiness and will Martin Heidegger especially his later writings repeatedly questions the autonomy the self and focuses the idea Being manifested the forgotten copula which underlies all language thinking and hence Dasein human being nature Most recently the work Jacques Derrida has expanded while challenging Heidegger writings most importantly the area absolute presence oneself truth his essay Speech and Phenomena More and more contemporary philosophy has focused the nature language whether merely medium for transporting data which information can encoded and later decoded whether language ineluctably embedded data and information and vice versa such question lies the perpetual conflict between science and the ineffability art the attempt abstract meaning from poem piece music The relation obvious the basis ones humanity language and the essence language defies modeling and synopsis strong impossible computer science implication sheaf nice hacks absolutely devoid beauty Back Andrew homepage
