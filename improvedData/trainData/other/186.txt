Christopher eds The Object Management Architecture Guide Rev John Wiley Sons and Object Management Group Framingham This the definitive overview guide the terminology objectives and the specification CORBA introduces the Object Management Group OMG Core Object Model the OMG Reference Model the standardization procedures the proposal procedures and specification guidelines OMG The OMG Reference Model consists the four layers the Object Request Broker ORB CORBAservices CORBAfacilities and Application Objects which the first three are described detail their own specification texts Object Management Group The Common Object Request Broker Architecture and Specification Rev Object Management Group Framingham The Object Request Broker ORB the foundation CORBA ORBs are essentially agents that transparently service data requests responses from CORBA objects and clients through object adaptors via object oriented version RPC mechanism The interfacing between ORBs and CORBA objects via the Interface Definition Language IDL and the Dynamic Invocation Interface DII are also specified Revision also defines interoperability and portability guidelines for ORBs from different vendors Object Management Group CORBAservices Common Object Services Specifications Object Management Group Framingham CORBAservices better known COSS for Common Object Services Specification literature the layer directly above ORBs that provide recognized set essential services available CORBA objects This growing document that not all envisioned services have been defined yet Some the specified ones include naming events transactions and persistence Object Management Group CORBAfacilities Common Facilities Object Management Group Framingham CORBAfacilities the layer above CORBAservices that defines higher level services and functions for the fourth layer end user applications the OMG Reference Model includes both horizontal and vertical CORBAfacilities which are mostly introduced but have yet specified this writing This growing document well Table Contents Tutorials Minton Gabriel Programming with CORBA Unix Review April This date and easy read tutorial CORBA provides background history OMG summarizes the information the defining specifications CORBA first four entries this bibliography and presents Interface Definition Language IDL and coding example using SunSoft NEO CORBA

Conference Object Oriented Technologies Monterey June USENIX Asso Berkeley Although CORBA meant for distributed systems one shortfall its lack dealing with fault tolerance which could implemented software groups replicated objects that utilize reliable multicast communication Recognizing this limitation the author presents and discusses Electra the best both worlds generic object request broker ORB that adds the reliable group multicast capabilities systems such Horus and Isis CORBA implementation Schmidt Harrison and Shaer Object Oriented Components for High speed Network Programming Proceedings the USENIX Conference Object Oriented Technologies Monterey June USENIX Asso Berkeley This paper presents another problem with CORBA evaluates performance problems communication middleware high speed networks CORBA based mechanisms like Orbix and ORBeline which are considerably slower are compared against based sockets The authors also devised middleground Adaptive Communications Environment ACE object oriented programming toolkit that improves the performance problems they have encountered Orfali Harkey and Edwards Client Server Components CORBA Meets OpenDoc Object Magazine May CORBAfacilities specifies higher level services and functions for the Application Objects layer the OMG Reference Model however most these have been introduced but have yet specified OpenDoc which essentially provides what CORBAfacilities requires mature and anticipated merged into adopted the CORBAfacilities specification this has occurred the writing this bibliography and has been named Distributed Document Component Facility OpenDoc enables the creation multiple live data live object compound documents Tisaranni John IONA Orbix Object Request Broker Object Magazine July Aug IONA Technologies Orbix one the most popular commercially available full implementations CORBA The author reviews versions Orbix that adheres the CORBA spec but focuses Orbix extensions that are not defined CORBA such object binding smart proxies IDL binding and more some these have become part the CORBA spec Work with other companies further address shortfalls CORBA are also briefly mentioned For instance Orbix Isis provides fault tolerance functionality Table Contents Different Perspectives Comparison Options Bernstein Philip Middleware Model for Distributed System Services Communications the ACM February CORBA not the only mechanism middleware that intended support distributed computing various competing models exist This paper provides educational look how the heterogeneity and distributed nature industry needs and requirements gave birth middleware classifies middleware and discusses services that middleware should provide Middleware integration issues and its future are examined well Schmidt Douglas and Vinoski Steve Modeling Distributed Object Applications Report Feb This second series columns distributed object computing DOC outlines approach DOC implementation discussing the application environment and requirements hardware network etc and examining key functionalities look for competing DOC frameworks CORBA Network OLE and OODCE For example CORBA does not have security measures multithreading capability however some these have become part the latest specification Brando Thom Comparing CORBA DCE Object Magazine March This informative guide CORBA through comparison with DCE Because their numerous similarities the author dispels confusion explaining CORBA through contrasting the differences between CORBA and DCE The paper includes clear diagram showing the OMG Reference Model and depicting specified and yet specified CORBA components Foody Michael OLE and COM CORBA Unix Review April Microsoft Component Object Model COM the defining object model for the popular Object Linking and Embedding OLE for desktop applications COM object model quite different from CORBA which makes interoperability between the two difficult OMG has completed the COM CORBA interoperability specification however distributed COM contained Network OLE see next entry still being defined and may pose greater challenge for interoperability specification between the two Halfhill Tom and Salamone Salvatore Components Everywhere BYTE Jan Network Object Linking and Embedding Network OLE from Microsoft and CORBA from the Object Management Group are compared CORBA already available with years refinement especially the new specification has added additional portability and distributed computing enhancements Although Network OLE not available yet Microsoft strategies and OLE availability make Network OLE formidable opponent Table Contents Real World CORBA Applications Pompeii John The Design and Construction LISA DBMS Magazine Dec This case study real world property
