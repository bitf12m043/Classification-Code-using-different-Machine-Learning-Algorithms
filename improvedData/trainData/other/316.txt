with topologies discovery and visualization faults detection and performance analisesJan wun Leejanwun cornell eduVince Livince cornell eduYing ming Tsaiyt cornell eduLin hsian Wanglinhsian cornell eduOverview Since mid the internet has been growing fastly exponential rate with different sizes and types networks connected together for data communications the networks become larger and more complex high quality networking monitoring system with network status control faults detection and performance analises becomes vital necessity for any distributed computing environment Problems occurred the network can easily reflected and solved very short time Our goal design and implement efficient network management system with different networks topologies discoveries and display through graphical interface give clear view the connections and status Faults detection and performace analises are also incorporated the project Technical Backgrounds Simple Network Management Protocols SNMP SNMP developed mid orderto provided simple and efficient protocol for network management data communications between different types networks easy implement large network system without posing too much stress the network Also being supported most the internetwork architetures routers and bridges The exchange information using SNMP made through messages PDU which can viewed objects that contain both values and titles from higher perspective There are only five types PDUs used SNMP monitor the network two for terminal data settings two for terminal data reading and one for monitoring events such start and shut downs Project Success Criteria deliverable software with GUI that displays different topologies and network status Manager interactions with the network The basic management specifications such fault detection and topologies display and performanace analises achieved Successfu testing simulated local area network Expected Educational Results Understand the use the most popular networking management communication protocols Learn the different network models and management issues associated the networks Capability design management applications according the specifications and considering some major issues such security management configuration management fault management and accounts management Know how manage network system References COMER

Interprocessor Collective Communications Library iCC Payne Intel SSD Shuler Sandia National Laboratories van Geijn University Texas Austin Watts California Institute Technology Current version Release March Please sign our guestbook What new MPI like group interface Version iCC for OSF Version iCC for SUNMOS New reference manual that includes group interface New summary not yet finished Fortran example for using groups New paper comparing iCC MPI and BLACS Tutorial Collective Communication PowerPoint presentation The first and only far valid bug report since Spring Patch Fixes above bug Introduction This page describes the second release the Interprocessor Collective Communications InterCom Library iCC release This library the result ongoing collaboration between David Payne Intel SSD Lance Shuler Sandia National Laboratories Robert van Geijn University Texas Austin and Jerrell Watts California Institute Technology funded the Intel Research Council and Intel SSD Previous contributors this effort include Mike Barnett Univ Idaho Satya Gupta Intel SSD Rik Littlefield PNL and Prasenjit Mitra now with Oracle The library implements comprehensive approach collective communication The results are best summarized the following performance tables Comparison the various libraries The following tables give the ratios times required for completion mesh Paragon using OSF Broadcast bytes iCC BLACS iCC MPI iCC Sum All bytes iCC BLACS iCC MPI iCC Attaining the improvement performance easy linking library that automatically translates collective communication calls iCC calls Furthermore the iCC library gives additional functionality like scatter and gather operations and more general gopf combine operations had been planned MPI like group interface iCC now available The interface lets the user create and free groups and communicators and gives user defined groups complete access the high performance routines the iCC library would like note that this library not intended compete with MPI was started research project into techniques required develop high performance implementations the MPI collective communication calls are making this library available service the user community with the hope that these techniques eventually are incorporated into efficient MPI implementations Using the library Manuals Reference manual Summary How get iCC

AssignmentsFive programs will assigned during the semester Programs count for your final grade Programs take from hours for the average student complete You should expect spend considerable time doing work outside class for this typical for most courses since helps immensely learning the material Develop your class and main program using multiple files and coordinating compilation using makefile Break the problem down into parts and develop your program incrementally rather than trying code all once See Working with UNIX for more information about organizing your files compiling multiple files using make and using the debuggers The programs will linked the list below they are assigned sure read and follow the grading standards for each assignment Once you have completed assignment you will need create output file with test cases that demonstrate your program Then follow the handin procedure suggest that you plan finishing least day before the due date you find that you are having difficulty finishing assignment are just running out time rather engaging some form academic misconduct see the TAs for help make use the late policy The AssignmentsProgram Due Program Due Program Due
