Abstract Doctoral Dissertation Vicki Almstrum May The University Texas Austin Supervising professors Ralph Cain and Nell Dale This research explored the understanding that novice computer science students have mathematical logic Because concepts logic are the heart many areas computer science was hypothesized that solid understanding logic would help students grasp basic computer science concepts more quickly and would better prepare them for advanced topics such formal verification program correctness This exploratory study lays the groundwork for further investigation this hypothesis Data for the study were the publicly available versions the Advanced Placement Examination Computer Science APCS examination and files containing anonymous individual responses students who took these examinations content analysis procedure was developed provide reliable and valid classification multiple choice items from the APCS examinations based the relationship between concepts covered each item and the concepts logic The concepts the computer science subdomain logic were clarified means taxonomy developed for use this study Thirty eight experts computer science education were judges the content analysis the multiple choice items The judges ratings provided criteria for grouping items into strongly related and not strongly related partitions general the mean proportion student respondents that correctly answered the items partition was lower for the strongly related than for the not strongly related partition with smaller standard deviation The difficulty distributions for the two partitions were shown non homogeneous with the difficulty distribution for the strongly related partition skewed more towards the very difficult end the distribution The results this study suggest that novice computer science students experience more difficulty with concepts involving mathematical logic than they general with other concepts computer science This indicates need improve the way which novice computer science students learn the concepts logic particular pre college preparation mathematical logic and the content discrete mathematics courses taken computer science students need scrutinized Email addresses almstrum utexas edu Date Tue Jan GMT Server NCSA Content type text html The IEEE RTS Home Page The IEEE RTS Home Page Welcome the WWW Home
