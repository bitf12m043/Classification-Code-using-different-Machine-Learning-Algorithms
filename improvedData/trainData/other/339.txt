UntitledHand for Project Hand Procedure The procedure for handing project and the rest the projects this semester will little different than for project You should follow the guidelines below Bring hard copy all your java files class the day the program due you not want lose late days Submit electronic version all you files java makefile output files etc the hand directory either you your partner Your hand directory for project public handin project you are programming home using the Windows version Java you will still need hand your code line and you should make sure works the Solaris environment which will entail adding the ThreadScheduler code Add README file your electronic hand directory that contains the following Name you and your partner Project information project number date etc Information how run your program brief map the classes you have written and what they Any other information you feel important for the know Output Files You should not hand hard copy your output will use too much paper Instead you should run the tests required the assignment and output the results file would prefer you could create separate files for each test Alg Peterson test Alg Peterson test Alg Star test Alg Star test instead having everything bunched together into single typescript file You can this redirecting the output The format the output described the assignment Comments Comments are going worth least the grade for this assignment you not want lose any the points you should follow the guidelines below You should write your name and your partner name the assignment number and the hand date the top all your java files well give brief description what the file contains You should comment your variables know how they are used Functions should commented their purpose what variables are being passed what value being returned any well any side effects You should document segments code and provide the purpose each Particularly difficult segments code will require more commenting Program Structure Program structure will also worth least Some guidelines follow Your code should correctly indented You code should have blank lines separating different segments code Variable names should have meaning Curly brackets should correctly lined
