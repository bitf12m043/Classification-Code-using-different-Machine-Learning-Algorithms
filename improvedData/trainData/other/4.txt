Prelim questionsPrelim notesReview session Sunday Prelim Monday PMCoverage everything but there will detailed questions the stack model Closed book closed notes mostly for your benefit Bring writing implement don stress memorizationWe will forgive minor syntactic errorsRoom assignments Upson Phillips Don miss the prelim Make exams are oral and guaranteed easier than the real oneCompound statementsAnother kind statement actually seen this already but hadn given name This what the curly braces least farSort like begin and end PASCALSyntax open curly brace then more statements then closed curly brace square compound expression can include declaration statements but they must all appear the beginning before any statement which not declaration statement Example with declaration int square Scoping rulesNasty example don write code like this void main int int printf The rule simple figure out which intended look outwards from the line you are until you find You can add this the stack model but little ugly and won itWe won use this feature anything very complicated BWhere have seen compound statements Conditional statements often involve compound statementsif test thenstatement else elsestatementtest expression but thenstatement and elsestatement can any statementIt good practice use compound statements with conditional statements makes your code much easier readWhere else have seen compound statements Hint this case they usually involve declarationsFun with elseYou don actually need use else with ifif printf This can lead totally unreadable code especially you nest your statements Don this else There reasonable way doing multiway conditional statementsif test statement else test statement else test statement else defaultstatementI don personally find this incredibly readable but sometimes necessaryIterationToday mostly cover the syntax iteration CWe some examples its use sectionIteration involves executing some part your program repeatedly does recursion The easiest way iteration with whilewhile expression statementTypically statement compound statementsemantics while evaluate expression false zero then done with the while statement true non zero then evaluate statement then evaluate the while statement againExamplevoid countdown int count while count printf count count count printf Blastoff void main start countdown start printf start This example also shows off subtle but important property the stack modelNote that the test expression never your while statement will run foreverHow get out while statement early while count printf count NASA goofed return count count Break statementsSuppose that instead getting out the entire countdown function merely want get out the while statementNASA didn goof the astronauts got impatient and decided blast off before the countdown finishedThere good way and bad way only going teach you the good way The break statement terminates while statementvoid countdown int count while count printf count count count astronauts bored count break printf Blastoff What about nested while statements Again this allows unreadable code createdThe world has enough this without you folks contributing Small example while while abs break test break The rule that break statement terminates the smallest while statement that encloses itIteration and the stack modelAs far the stack model concerned iteration primitives aren much different than conditional statements They simply manipulate the program counterThese primitives are sometimes called Control Flow primitivesFencepost errorsWith iteration and also with recursion becomes very easy make fencepost errorsSuppose you want build fence and you need install posts which are apartHow many fenceposts you need void nastybug int count count while count count count something count This kind bug hard find general MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last
