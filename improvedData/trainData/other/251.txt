handouts shelf outside all hours Office hours Tuesday Thursday appointment Phone dept number Course Introduction This class designed take you from zero knowledge computers being crack shot user and using these skills get yourself through college and into the job arena Lectures use Macintosh computers labs while Lectures use computers Many software packages allow you switch back and forth between the Mac and the discuss this but you may not switch between lectures and lectures they are given different lecturers The course has two components Part Lecture the lecture will discuss computers generic terms general computer science topics will discuss how computers work including the following topics not necessarily this order application programs including word processors spreadsheets graphics and databases hardware input output storage devices operating systems programming languages networks and telecommunications artificial intelligence and expert systems and computer related social issues Whew These topics are comparable those you find non Macintosh environments What you learn will useful the real world Both lectures and will cover the same material Lecture outlines are available from DoIT MACC for small fee prior the lecture You may attend either lecture for exams you need attend the time for which you are registered Exam material will based the lectures and textbook Part Lab the laboratory discussion sections you will have hands experience Macintosh IIci computers with the following programs word processing Word painting and drawing Aldus SuperPaint electronic mail Eudora and navigating the Internet Netscape spreadsheet and charting Excel database Claris Filemaker presentation manager HyperCard and desktop publishing Aldus PageMaker integral part lab learning the Macintosh operating system System well addition there are some special tools ROM and scanners available There are TAs that teach these sections You will learn the name your and his her office location and office hours your first lab session One more our TAs may speak English with noticeable accent some cases accent might cause some initial difficulty understanding but short time such difficulties usually disappear and accents become familiar one ear for whatever reason you experience difficulties understanding your instructor then requests for repeating sentences and for clarification can and should made Not only does this help you the student but also helps your instructor improving his her presentations and becoming more effective teacher Other classroom difficulties can usually cleared bringing them the attention your instructor either after lecture her office Both the TAs and have the goal providing you with high quality instruction and rich educational experience Yes LABS meet starting the first day the semester have our own Macintosh computers The laboratory located the first floor the Computer Science Building Room The room along the hallway the north west corner the building Disks You must have TWO inch disks which you will keep your Macintosh projects You should have two you can save your work two locations These disks may purchased from MACC sure that you buy double sided high density diskettes should preprinted the label the diskettes you purchase Attendance You will not graded lecture attendance participation However strongly recommend lecture attendance and you are solely responsible for making sure that you not miss assignment due dates and other class information including announcements exam rooms and material covered the tests Let very clear the primary source material for the course contained the lectures The textbook also contains material that will allow you catch and review some but not all this material Old notes from previous semesters are known sketchy and prone errors and are not recommended Nothing can substitute for lecture attendance Lab attendance and class participation requirements are determined each Exam attendance mandatory you are ill and cannot attend exam you must present some written dated proof your excuse and notify Sally Peterson early possible PRIOR the scheduled time exam Exam rooms are different than the lecture hall exam rooms will posted lab and are available from the department secretary you forget Assignments Tutorials are the second textbook mentioned below and are designed self guiding tours through the various applications your lab assignments are based You will get much more out your limited lab time you READ THE TUTORIAL PRIOR sitting down the computer The assignments will given you lab class Assignments must done using the versions the software programs own Assignments are due the end lab the due date They must turned electronically and paper Since this frequently causes congestion the printers wise print out each section the assignment you complete Note that assignment due dates may spread over three day period because there are classes which meet and only the course the semester each person will have approximately the same number hours the computer you have access Macintosh computer and any all this software versions compatible with those that use you are welcome work outside the lab You may also work different time than your regularly scheduled lab there space students registered for that particular lab time always have priority You must hand the assignment YOUR and you must able show that you are competent with the program you don regularly attend lab sure bring your disk when you turn your assignment since you may asked your demonstrate the skills learned the assignment There are laser printers the lab for you use for printing your assignments You are NOT use them for printing personal documents papers for other courses this considered misuse University property There are laser printers you can use the other Instructional Labs for that purpose Extra Sunday Labs will open and staffed TAs Sunday afternoons starting September between the hours There will sign sheet posted Friday the door the lab for you reserve machine for particular time Grading your grade the average your lab assignments and the average your exams for each exam extra credit available Incompletes are granted rarely ever Letter grades are assigned the basis the following distribution not curve would your disadvantage did because the high grades most people make labs Usually grades are higher for the lab assignments and lower the exams This expected since the lab assignments are very cookbookish you follow the directions you get the assignment done correctly work ensure consistency grades between sections below FLab Assignments Laboratory assignments are worth points points which are for quiz The quiz each topic will given the lab period following the due date Partial credit will given for partially completed assignments always turn something Save your graded quiz and exam papers and the files your disks until you have checked the posted scores sure that your points are recorded correctly Late penalty The last assignment may not turned late score Other assignments may turned ONE lab period following their due date with penalty assignment will accepted after that time score Remember that delaying completion one assignment you get further behind all the rest The key success this course keeping AHEAD Each student may have two free late penalties per semester These late days are used you must out town you are ill and may only used one per assignment Any lab assignments that are two more lab periods late are worth zero points This generous policy there will exceptions Academic Honesty and Integrity All assignments must YOUR OWN WORK Although you are encouraged communicate with each other design and planning and the use the software you may not have someone else part all the work for you the University Wisconsin Madison believe that academic honesty and integrity are fundamental the mission higher education and the university The university has responsibility promote academic honesty and integrity and develop procedures deal effectively with instances academic dishonesty Students are responsible for the honest completion and representation their work making appropriate citation sources and for respect others academic endeavors Students who violate these standards must confronted and must accept the consequences their actions UWS you are uncertain whether something acceptable ask your Sally Peterson the instructor your responsibility understand class rules and not leave your assignments the hard disk server you get caught cheating you may withdrawn from fail the class will prosecute cheaters the maximum allowed under the Student Disciplinary code Textbooks Copies both texts are reserve Wendt Library Information Technology and Society Laudon Traver and Laudon published Wadsworth second editionPoint Click and Drag Using the Macintosh Peterson TAs published Harper Collins Fourth Edition The right one purple Exams There will two exams Each worth your total grade take exams Lab Section small rooms that may change your responsibility find these rooms list will posted our lab outside office with the dept secretaries and lecture shortly before each exam They are scheduled for Tuesday October lecture time period Wednesday December final time Check your calendars now you anticipate conflict you may have withdraw from this course There are make exams not possible change the time date final policy Faculty Senate rule even you have more than three exams hour period The final time set the timetable The exams cover lecture and textbook material all exams including the final will non cumulative You may asked show your picture the exams
