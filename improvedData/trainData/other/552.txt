graphics will introduce various types parametric surfaces Procedure First you will need download two files this click each the filenames shown below When the text window opens use the save option put the file your own directory Name each file with the same name shown below parametric net parametric cfg After downloading the files start then open and execute parametric net Each module when opened has one line explanation its function One the Compute modules performs the main operation mapping grid coordinates make the parametric surface The others just produce and produce the variables Assignment Quadric surfaces Modify the Compute Parametric net produce unit sphere Use another Compute module convert the sphere superquadric That the vector quadric surface then superquadric surface where the power vector just means the power each term Try values from You will need handle negative values and the compute Make the value set interactor The two images below show sphere modified and respectively Figures rotation Modify the program produce figure rotation given cylinder radius abs where the axis the rotation Modify the program produce figure rotation which approximates the shape drink bottle The bottle should have least neck and body with bottom Two bottles modeled spring are particularly elaborate juice bottle Coke bottle Bottles modeled beer bottle vase soda bottle Note that the form used compute module conditional not equal zero then else This allows arbitrary functions constructed For example try make funnel Modify the original Parametric net program convert the torus into spiral spring with four complete turns Animate the spring that one end the spring remains fixed and the other end undergoes simple harmonic motion The spring should not pass through itself and the motion should repeat every frames Model sphere which moves sinusoidally that sin phi with the end the spring and appears attached the spring One frame animation shown below Bugs The comment the Construct module incorrect should read make grid spanning prepared demo and explain the superquadric function your soda bottle and spring animation The Lab grading guide will filled out consultant

Optimal Clustering for Delay Minimization Proceedings the Design Automation Conference June This paper addresses the problem circuit clustering for delay minimization subject area capacity constraints use the general delay model for which only heuristic solutions were known present optimum polynomial time algorithm for combinational circuits under this model Our algorithm can generalized solve the problem under any monotone clustering constraint Contact rraj utexas edu Honghua Yang and Wong Circuit Clustering for Delay Minimization under Area and Pin Constraints Proceedings the International Workshop Field Programmable Gate Arrays February consider the problem circuit partitioning for multiple chip implementation One motivation for studying this problem the current needs good partitioning tools for implementing circuit multiple FPGA chips allow replication logic gates would reduce circuit delay Circuit partitioning with replication logic gates also called circuit clustering this paper present circuit clustering algorithm that minimizes circuit delay subject area and pin constraints each chip under the general delay model developed repeated network cut technique find cluster that bounded both area and pin constraints Our algorithm optimal under either the area constraint only the pin constraint only tested our algorithm set benchmark circuits and consistently obtained optimal near optimal results Contact yanghh utexas edu Honghua Yang and Wong Efficient Network Flow Based Min Cut Balanced Partitioning Proceedings the IEEE International Conference Computer Aided Design Nov consider the problem bipartitioning circuit into two balanced components that minimizes the number crossing nets Previously the Kernighan and Lin type heuristics the simulated annealing approach and the spectral method were given solve the problem However network flow techniques were overlooked viable approach min cut balanced bipartition due its high complexity this paper propose balanced bipartition heuristic based repeated max flow min cut techniques and give efficient implementation that has the same asymptotic time complexity that one max flow computation implemented our heuristic algorithm package called FBB The experimental results demonstrate that FBB outperforms the heuristics and the spectral method terms the number crossing nets and the efficient implementation makes possible partition large circuit instances with reasonable runtime For example the average elapsed time for bipartitioning circuit almost gates less than minutes Contact yanghh utexas edu Date Tue Jan
