watch movies Unfortunately were unable take the advantage digital format have not seen mpeg players allowing user skip arbitrary frame fast forward rewind etc Even more importantly the video was basically sequence frames with structure But obvious that video higher structure than frames can partition video into shots scenes and larger chunks like movies shows etc can also partition the video accoding the content for example might want select segment video which particular actor appears Mpeg browse provides interface for browsing video User can play video stop arbitrary point fast forward What the advantage MPEG Browse over other video players MPEG Browse adds very limited yet useful structure the video partitions the video into shots Based these information the browser can skip the next shot much like player can skip the next song The scene break algorithm was developed Ramin Zabih Justin Miller and Kavin Mai For more details about the algorithm see href Mpeg browse works two modes preprocessing and browsing Preprocessing necessary for two reasons the algorithm for detecting scene breaks doesn run real time and the decoder not fast enough which means that order skip some place the movie the user would have wait about long would take play the sequence Preprocessing madatory since the information generated essential the work browser The preprocessing has done only once the information for each mpeg file saved the disk file filename inf where the filename the name the mpeg addition video browsing mpeg browse supports wide variety options both command line and menu Most options have effect after the start the video but future releases will allow change many options like dithering frame rate skiping frames arbitrary times Mpeg browse runs Linux SunOS Solaris and probably any machine other which has wish and can compile Berkeley mpeg play Visitors Download distribution MPEG BrowseSend comments and suggestions Robert Szewczyk szewczyk cornell edu MIME Version
