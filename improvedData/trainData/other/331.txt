they are cheap expensive and ubiquitous Hardware trends vacuum tubes core memory punched cards transistors magnetic tapes integrated circuits disks VLSI computer chip main frame million and mini workstation micro network computer and Software Batch system One user time Same person was programmer operator and end user who wants something done multiprogrammed more than one job time improve utilization spooling time sharing multiple interactive users single user come full circle Other kinds systems Transaction processing banking airlines Real time missile defense factory control Embedded systems computer every toaster What For Beautification Principle The goal make hardware look better than More regular uniform instead lots idiosyncratic devices Easier program don have worry about speeds asynchronous events Closer what needed for applications named variable length files rather than disk blocks multiple CPU one for each user shared system activity single user system multiple large dynamically growing memories virtual memory Resource principleThe goal mediate sharing scarce resources What resource Something that costs money Why share expensive devices need share data database expensive device cooperation between people community expensive device Problems getting work all getting work efficiently utilization keeping all the devices busy throughput getting lot useful work done per hour response getting individual things done quickly protection limiting the effects bugs preventing idiots from ruining for everyone preventing unauthorized access data modification data use resources preventing bad guys from ruining for everyone Bottom View starting with the hardware Hardware summary more details later components one more central processing units CPU main memory RAM core devices bus other communication mechanism connects them all together CPU has pointing next instruction execute fetches instructions one time from location specified increments after fetching instruction branch instructions can also alter the responds interrupts jumping different location like unscheduled procedure call Memory responds load and store requests from the CPU one time device Usually looks like chunk memory the CPU CPU sets options and starts sending store requests particular address CPU gets back status and small amounts data issuing load requests Direct memory access DMA Device may transfer large amounts data directly from memory doing loads and stores just like CPU Issues interrupt the CPU indicate that done Timing problemI devices are millions even billions times slower than CPU Typical million instructions sec Typical disk takes get one byte from disk ratio Typical typist wpm word bytes sec million instructions per key stroke And that doesn include head scratching time Solution start disk device instructions other useful computation wait for disk finish Terrible program write debug And would change with faster disk Better solution Process for start wait for finish use the data for something Process for some useful computation Operating system takes care switching back and forth between process and process appropriate Question which process should have higher priority Space problemMost the time typical program wasting most the memory space allocated Looping one subroutine wasting space allocated rest program Fiddling with one data structure wasting space allocated other data structures Waiting for user input wasting all its space Solution virtual memoryKeep program and data disk times cheaper byte automatically copies memory pieces needed program demand Top Down View what does look like various kinds users End user Wants get something done bill customers write love letter play game design bomb Doesn know what care May not even realize there computer there Application programmer Writes software for end users Uses beautified virtual machine named files unlimited size unlimited memory read write returns immediately Calls library routines some really are just subroutines written someone else sort array solve differential equation search string for character others call the operating system read write create process get more memory Systems programmer you the end this course Creates abstractions for application programmers Deals with real devices Course Outline Processes What processes are Using
