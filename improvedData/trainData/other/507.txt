This spring will holding Undergraduate Computer Science Fair The Fair will run the spirit local science fair and students may enter any project that has relevance computer science The intention the Fair enourage students work independent projects and give them public showplace for projects demonstrating their creativity and originality Secondly students often cite their work independent projects their fondest memories the undergraduate experience Finally will use the Fair tool for increasing the visibility our students with potential employers and potential graduate departments The Fair will

additional links from the department homepage order showplace examples what Cornell undergraduates will also having poster session which all the entries will physically displayed the general public for one afternoon One member the team entrants should hand all times describe the project For those that wish will allow the entrants bring personal computer order give demonstrations projects will able provide power but networking capabilities Sample Projects The projects might theoretical nature involve interesting program Some possibilites include but are not limited interesting extension enhancement project turned for course result independent research project new mathematical theorem interesting new proof known theorem Especially encouraged project that does not fall within the scope any one course computer game that takes illustrates interesting aspect interesting tool for the web for examples visit the MIT Media Lab since artists seem the cutting edge using computers new ways one might produce new tool for generating artwork you happen NYC you might want stop the Mediascape exhibit the Guggenheim SoHo for ideas alternately there are several web sites that are interest one example the artnetweb note the list companies that sponsor that page Elegibility Any Cornell undergrad may enter the contest Group work allowed long all members the group are Cornell undergrads the project done part ongoing Cornell research project then crucial that you clarify the exact contribution your work relation the contributions persons that are not part the project team background the problem and the previous work done should also provided faculty sponsorship required cannot emphasize enough the importance clearly stating the contributions the project and providing well written description remember that people will quit reading listening you soon they get bored tired Projects must comply with the Engineering College Code Academic Integrity and Policy Notebook reserve the right exclude projects that feel not comply with the above criteria Important Dates Firm dates will announced later date Tentatively form indicating intent submit project will due January this will include information such the project title and names students working the project Webpages describing the projects should ready for public perusal February and the Fair poster session will held some afternoon during the week February roughly For more details and updates see our website Questions mail Biana Brukman byb cornell edu Date Tue Jan GMT Server NCSA Last modified Mon Dec GMT Content type
