Composition Horus Robbert van Renesse Kenneth Birman Roy Friedman Mark Hayden and David Karr Dept Computer Science Cornell University Abstract The Horus system supports communication architecture that treats protocols instances abstract data type This approach encourages developers partition complex protocols into simple microprotocols each which implemented protocol layer Protocol layers can stacked top each other variety ways run time First describe the classes protocols that can supported this way Next present the Horus object model that designed for this technology and the interface between the layers that makes all work then present example layer that implements group membership protocol Next show how given set required properties appropriate stack can constructed look example stack protocols which provides fault tolerant totally ordered communication between group processes The work contributes standard framework for protocol development and experimentation provides high performance implementation the virtual synchrony model and introduces methodology for increasing the robustness the protocol development process Introduction Classes Protocols Horus Objects Common Protocol Interface Example Membership Protocol Protocol Properties and Inheritance Example Typical Protocol Stack Reference Implementation Effort The End End Argument Performance and Overhead Status

programs the Java language This online version The Java Tutorial Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath This the fifth book The Java Series published Addison Wesley this summer Notes This document was last updated July Copyright This version reflects the API distributed the Java Developers Kit JDK For information how the API has changed and how get the JDK see the JDK home page For the change history the tutorial how download the tutorial PostScript and HTML formats and other information about this document see About This Draft For information about the structure and organization this tutorial please refer How Use the Tutorial Getting Started The most common Java programs are applications and applets Applications are standalone programs such the HotJava browser Applets are similar applications but they don run standalone Instead applets adhere set conventions that lets them run within Java compatible browser you using browser that can view applets you should see animation just below this paragraph that applet embedded this HTML page The Hello World Application Start here you want create standalone Java applications The Hello World Applet Start here you are interested writing applets only What Next Now that you seen how write Java program you can proceed with any the topics below Writing Java Programs These lessons discuss techniques and concepts that any Java programmer can use The book version this tutorial breaks this trail two Writing Java Programs which contains the first three lessons shown the index page for the trail Using the Core Java Classes which contains the remaining six lessons Writing Applets These lessons discuss techniques and concepts that are specific writing Java applets Creating User Interface Here the information you need create the user interface your applet application Custom Networking and Security The lessons this trail teach you how connect your applications and applets the information the Internet Also this trail contains lesson that shows you how you can create install your own security manager which can help protect your computer and data from violation Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs These lessons show you everything you need know write native methods the Java language native method Java method whose implementation provided another programming language such This lesson includes step step instructions and comprehensive example program Table Contents Date Tue Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Tue Oct GMT Content length Class session diaries for
