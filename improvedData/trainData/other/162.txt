WillsonThematic roles and NLU This paper muses issues surrounding the adaptation various linguistic approaches argument structure for NLP purposes with the ultimate but oblique goal shedding light the age old question Are linguists useless Catherine StarkeyA German English Translator for Simple Sentences This project will take input series sentences English German and then parse them according corresponding set grammar rules Then using different set rules for the other language pieces together the new sentence with words entered lexicon Lin Hsian WangPrepositional Phrase Attachement Rule Based Approach solve the prepositional phrase attachment ambiguation using set rules generated Transformation Based Error Driven Learning algorithm Mao YonghongPart Speech Tagging Algorithms will compare some part speech tagging algorithms and try give some suggestions Eric ScharffNeural Networks for Part Speech DisambiguationApril thAlfred HongTranslation Regular Query Sentences into SQL Queries The idea this stems from the numerous Web forms today that provide search capability Often times one would like have query interface database relational but the search definition parameters are usually restrictive and inhuman Adding natural language query capability the search function while providing back end conversion equivalent SQL query database would makes things more human and natural and hopefully more powerful WaytJonathan DecristofaroMaking the Chart Parser Avoid Useless Work The bottom chart parser can very inefficient when there are many ways parse phrase This work eliminates the multiple parses generated when there ambiguous phrase like compound noun five words David WalkerStatistical Methods for Part Speech TaggingWee Liang HengProbabilistic Part Speech Tagging This project explores various statistical models smoothed bigram language model for part speech tagging and implements the associated algorithms The models will evaluated their accuracy either the PennTree Bank Brown corpus Daniel BrownText Compression Using NLP Most compression schemes take advantage the fact that certain symbols the input file are much more likely frequent than others This project will attempt take advantage the fact that certain sequences words are much more likely than others particular will assume that grammatical sentences are much more likely than ungrammatical sentences will encode sentences such way that grammatical sentences take less space May stHeji KimInformation Extraction from Poetic Forms The purpose this project will automatically gather useful information from poems via syntactic semantic parsing this information will the search keys index corpus poetry database Vera KettnakerDeriving the Meaning Novel Words The idea this project guess the meaning novel words first names abbreviations new terrorist organizations ect the basis expectations gain from the surrounding context Grzegorz CzajkowskiPavel NaumovPresentation Natural Language Sentence Nuprl Term Editor Adopt Nuprl term editor for natural language representation Write several programs that will extract information from natural sentences presented term editor say answer simplest questions base given group sentences Joel RosenzweigA Weather Text Processing and Understanding System writing grammar suitable for parsing weather text that can grab off the Internet Weather Channel Web site This system will look for thematic roles associated with the text provide summary the forecast Time permitting will make program that will interpret this summary data and generate weather map that depicts the forecast Christine ParadisTranslating English Sentence SQL Statement will translating English sentence SQL query initial approach this problem use the thematic role information for given sentence and map this information the corresponding SQL constructs For evaluation the system will generate SQL statements for set test sentences and compare the results with desired correct SQL statements MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last Modified Monday Jan GMT Zheng Lin Home Page Zheng Lin About
