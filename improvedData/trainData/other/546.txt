page number The first equation the page has two mistakes should read Also should read dot The third row second column entry view should sin phi not sin theta The first matrix incorrect not orthonormal and thus cannot the product two rotations The second constraint the middle the page should read Normalizing the range values that the range Matrix equation has incorrect last COLUMN should read should read norm Equation should have set brackets that the multiplies the entire expression Figure confusing best think that the vector should and the vector should The third equation the page gives function The should eta the index refraction The equation just rearranged version the one above The second numbered bullet should read These values eta Note that the code the index refraction refered
