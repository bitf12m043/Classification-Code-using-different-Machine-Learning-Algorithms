Software John BelizaireJulian Pelenur Mauricio Aguilar AlvarezAbstract There growing need for parallel programming software tools that make writing parallel programs easier The goal provide transparent communication message passing multiprocessor environment have implemented software package using that meets this need this paper describe the design and implementation Global Pointers over

grading modified curve which natural breakpoints between clusters numerical scores determines letter grade COURSE DESCRIPTION This introductory course the major topics the areas image synthesis interactive techniques geometric modeling and computer based animation The material covered includes basic principles operation raster graphics display devices and common two dimensional input devices basic algorithms for creating and manipulating two dimensional raster objects including BitBlt techniques scan conversion methods for line segments circles and polygons filling algorithms and simple anti aliasing schemes homogeneous coordinate transformation techniques parallel and central projection and perspective transformations common algorithms for clipping including Cohen Sutherland Sutherland Hodgman and Liang Barsky hidden surface removal basic light and reflectance models for local illumination Gouraud and Phong shading and basic texture and bump mapping principles ray tracing basic parametric object modeling including Bezier and spline curves and surfaces basic interaction and user interface techniques principles hierarchical modeling and principles device independent graphics software architecture Grading will based two exams midterm and second exam given the last class day and series implementation projects which will assigned through the semester The exams will emphasize the ideas principles and mathematics behind the material covered and will not involve writing code fragments Persons taking this course pass fail basis need not take the exams For these students successful completion the projects will determine the course grade Project submissions will each include code listing and written project description which will include description the software architecture the system and user guide Programming may done any departmental workstation subject prior instructor approval other machines accessible the student This year have new graphics and multimedia teaching laboratory Painter Hall with Pentium workstations running Solaris This lab will used only students this course and the multimedia systems course and will more accessible than public workstations for project use The lab for course use only Grading involves interactive demonstrations the programs the students any machine used will have available for demonstrations have accessible counterpart which can the demos will assume students are familiar with Xwindows whatever alternative GUI programming environment they plan use The course will not concentrate teaching the use Xwindows any other windowing environment detail however Any programming language environment acceptable provided the instructor familiar enough with evaluate the project This should checked advance the student wishes employ any potentially exotic technology highly recommend the use the OpenGL graphics library its equivalent basis for image synthesis these projects this rapidly emerging the industry standard graphics library The public domain Mesa package which provides OpenGL like set libraries for dimensional image generation available for your use the lab and the departmental SUNs and IBM terminals This package publicly available those who wish use private systems see the Mesa Home Page have successfully installed Linux based PCs and there are versions available for Windows and for Macintoshes well addition many vendors provide OpenGL for their own platforms and commercial versions for variety platforms are available from Portable Graphics and Template Graphics Date Tuesday

cannot find correct type for your machine Edit the file and check that the switch constants are correct for your machine maybe you are running Linux and the switch have for Linux Linux you just need change the The system freezes after clicking the boot button the system from the user interface You will need rlogin into the machine you ran from and kill the process called plm This problem caused one three problems rhosts file does not contain the machine you are running from You not have write permission the directory you are running from and therefore the server blocking the file system too full There executable for the server for the architecure you are running from you don have permission run Check the file plinda bin sunos plinda server change sunos solaris hpux depending your machine type not use the exit function inside plinda source code Instead use exit int val which will inform the runtime system that the program gracefully exiting rather than exit due failure The system not able start daemons remote machines when you add them the host pool Check that the rhosts file has the machine you are running the server Check that you can execute the daemon for that machine type that the file plinda bin sunos plinda daemon change sunos solaris hpux depending your machine type You cannot see your applications the application select box the user interface This probably because they not have the exe extension they are not readable Compilation your program deadlocked common error that you don have the right parameters real main correct real main should look like this real main int argc char argv char env The system not able start applications after clicking them The applications are not readable you have not compiled them for all the machines your host pool This very important since the system may try run application any machine the pool you need give the system permission start xwindow for the application Type xhost the console the machine you are sitting For PLinda arg rdp called with tuple pattern that does not match the eval tuple assert will fail the server This has been fixed When compiling you get the message tclMain tkMain resp and tkMaintk main multiply defined This because some linkers will pick all functions rather than just the first This can usually fixed with the right flags passed which will pass them you can copy the libtcl and libtk libraries private directory and libtcl tclMain and libtk tkMain which will remove the mains from these two libraries Make sure modify the makefile changing TCL LIBRARY and LIBRARY pick the new versions you still get this problem make sure the TCL LIBRARY and LIBRARY are before any others the link line obj Makefile When compiling there are warning messages can convert const gid gid plinda lib implicit declaration index comparison between signed and unsigned the gnu directory and long format used for int the monitor directory These are and should fixed soon Back PLinda homepage Last
