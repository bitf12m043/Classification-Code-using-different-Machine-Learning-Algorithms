Copies CodeWarrior can purchased from the Campus Store The CodeWarrior installed the CIT labs just like the one you would install your Mac except for few things have added the CSLib library and the Basic project stationery Note These additions were built using CodeWarrior version possible that they will not work with earlier versions CodeWarrior although have heard from people that they Once you have retrieved the Additions folder install the additions follows Open the Additions folder Inside there SimpleText file containing instructions similar these There are two folders called INTO MacOS Support and INTO Project Stationery The folder structure the Additions folder meant mirror the folder structure inside the Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder your copy CodeWarrior make easy follow these instructions Open your CodeWarrior Gold folder Open the Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder inside Open the INTO MacOS Support folder the additions Move the Support folder into the MacOS Support folder your Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder Open the INTO Project Stationery folder Move the Basic file into the Project Stationery folder your Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder Open the INTO Proj Stat Support folder the INTO Project Stationery folder Move the file into the Project Stationery Support folder the Project Stationery folder your CodeWarrior When you open new project with CodeWarrior you should now able select the Basic stationery This will include the CSLib library which should also now available you Click here get the Additions folder Additions Folder Other Machines you have copy CodeWarrior for computer other than the Mac you may still able set the environment However the course staff will not able support this Build the CSLib library Get the source code for anonymous FTP from Addison Wesley Follow the instructions page the Roberts textbook Appendix Library Sources Compile the source code your machine using CodeWarrior create the CSLib library for only compiled the genlib simpio string random and exception parts the library left out the graphics stuff everything seems work for your machine feel free compile all Put the compiled library and the library header files into the support directory for your CodeWarrior Make the Basic project stationery Our project stationery based the ANSI project stationery with the CSLib library added Put your project stationery the project stationery directory your CodeWarrior Spring pierce cornell edu MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last Modified Monday Sep GMT class Ray Tracer Ray Tracer modular ray tracer Ray Tracer Objects Supporting Objects Test Data Objects From Glasner there are eight stages creating image Generating initial sample points Evaluating the data the sample points Combining the samples with any other samples taken Testing determing sampling complete Generating additional sample points needed Reconstructing the original signal based the sampled data Sampling the reconstruction for the appropriate display Displaying the image This project addresses each step above creating class objects and several supporting objects whose purpose complete one the eight steps using the ray tracing framework The modularity this approach allows user easily extend any specific function ray tracer subclassing one the existing classes and adding the desired functionality this manner user could easily test new idea for example new jitter method without having write entire ray tracer test the new functions have created three types objects The first set objects required the ray tracing paradigm The second set group objects which support the implementation this framework Finally the third set the objects used particular test data These objects are just for the sampling the data have created application which produces PPM file format based single sample per pixel alphabetic index hierarchy classessource codeIsaac Sheldon isheldon utexas

points plane attempting separate two point sets with intersecting convex hulls dimensional real space formulated linear program with equilibrium constraints LPEC This general LPEC can converted exact penalty problem with quadratic objective and linear constraints Frank Wolfe type algorithm proposed for the penalty problem that terminates stationary point global solution Novel aspects the approach include linear complementarity formulation the step function that counts misclassifications Exact penalty formulation without boundedness nondegeneracy constraint qualification assumptions iii exact solution extraction from the sequence minimizers the penalty function for finite value the penalty parameter for the general LPEC and explicitly exact solution for the LPEC with uncoupled constraints
