implemented system called QDOCS for multiple fault diagnosis continuous dynamic systems using QSIM models The main contributions the algorithm include method for propagating dependencies while solving general constraint satisfaction problem and method for verifying the consistency behavior with model across time Through systematic experiments two realistic engineering systems demonstrate that QDOCS demonstrates the best balance generality accuracy and efficiency among competing methods Qualitative Multiple Fault Diagnosis Continuous Dynamic Systems Using Behavioral Modes Siddarth Subramanian Thesis Department Computer Sciences University Texas Austin August systems like chemical plants power plants and automobiles get more complex online diagnostic systems are becomingly increasingly important One the ways rein the complexity describing and reasoning about large systems such these describe them using qualitative rather than quantitative models Model based diagnosis class diagnostic techniques that use direct knowledge about how system functions instead expert rules detailing causes for every possible set symptons broken system Our research builds standard methods for model based diagnosis and extends them the domain complex dynamic systems described using qualitative models motivate and describe out algorithm for diagnosing faults dynamic system given qualitative model and sequence qualitative states The main contributions this algorithm include method for propagating dependencies while solving general constraint satisfaction problem and method for verfying the compatibility behavior with model across time The algorithm can diagnose multiple faults and uses models faulty behavior behavioral modes then demonstrate these techniques using implemented program called QDOCS and test some realistic problems Through our experiments with model the reaction control system RCS the space shuttle and with level controller for reaction tank show that QDOCS

International Workshop Qualitative Reasoning about Physical Systems Nara Japan June The problem learning qualitative models physical systems from observations its behaviour has been addressed several researchers recent years Most current techniques limit themselves learning single qualitative differential equation model the entire system However many systems have several qualitative differential equations underlying them this paper present approach learning the models for such systems Our technique divides the behaviours into segments each which can explained single qualitative differential

Constraints are generated and filtered both comparison with the input behaviors and dimensional analysis the user provides complete information the input behaviors and the dimensions the input
