Metropolitan Area Network Using Distributed Switching Arthur Karshmer and Renwei Yan Computer Science Department Computing Research Laboratory New Mexico State University Las Cruces USA ABSTRACT number protocols have been proposed allow the use standard cable television plants support metropolitan area networking the present work describe new approach solving the problem that has some interesting properties its ability support large numbers users fixed transmission rates relatively low cost Introduction major goal all computer network designs the distribution information fast error free manor the lowest possible cost One method accomplishing this goal use already existing technologies new and imaginative ways Although designed for different purposes the cable television systems CATV already place much the provide interesting and potentially useful platform for the distribution digital data metropolitan area scale the CATV systems use were initially designed for one way communications any plan use them must include either upgrading currently installed upstream amplifiers the actual implementation them The problems associated with using these types facilities were studied and has been demonstrated that using such facilities technically and economically feasible Karshmer Thomas and Phelan Karshmer and Thomas These studies along with others Hatamain Hafez have demonstrated potential strengths and weaknesses using such systems Possibly the greatest strength using CATV based networks their almost universal existence the Approximately all homes are currently connected cable plant and virtually every building most cities passed cable One the key problems associated with using the branching tree topology cable plant access control Due the separation upstream and downstream channels any message from source node leaf must sent upstream the head end and then downstream the destination node another leaf This round trip time can cause large delay message transmission and reception which can render access control technique such CSMA useless the current work present results from the analysis system that reduces message transmission time two way CATV network while not decreasing network throughput develop model two level CATV networking scheme which then tested using well know simulation techniques Finally the simulation results are analyzed and are compared best throughput and expected delay times Distributed switching over single trunk CATV network Figure shows simplified view our two level single trunk CATV network with switches installed the trunk Each switch turn connected branch cable that supports branch nodes network subscribers Each trunk node switch has three inputs trunk upstream trunk downstream and branch upstream well three outputs Each branch node has one output for branch upstream and one input for branch downstreamSince all trunk nodes have certain level intelligence the traffic flow the trunk totally controlled The goal the intelligent trunk nodes turn around messages onto the appropriate branch cable the earliest possible time The head end therefore not the only node that can redirect messages our system able redirect messages the earliest possible time believe the system can reduce message travel time reduce message delay and increase system throughput Figure shows the simulation results for the node case with different node distribution the trunk and branch cables The distributions are trunk node and branch nodes trunk nodes and nodes per branch trunk nodes and nodes per branch trunk nodes and nodes per branch and trunk nodes and nodes per branch Figure shows the DELAYs related these different distributions The following figure shows packet length bits and baud rate Mbps Figure shows that with fixed baud rate Mbps and fixed packet size bits the throughput total number packets each branch cable almost identical Therefore the total throughput the system within given time expressed the following equation the value Num Packets per branch almost identical the same values for and each branch cable seems clear that putting the control node the trunk cable will linearly increase the throughput for the entire network this case the implementation intelligent node the trunk cable resulted the desired performance Since Slotted Aloha can double the throughput each branch can see that the total throughput also doubled This implies that the better the protocol the branch level the more the total system throughput increases Figure shows that the DELAY time may reduced even the number trunk control nodes increases The following equation shows that the lay mainly caused two factors the size waiting queue and the retransmission rate which what queuing theory would predict there are too many messages the trunk control nodes waiting transmitted the DELAY will increase This means that the traffic greater than trunk capacity the store and forward protocol truck level will cause long DELAY and deteriorate overall system performance Conclusions The results from the current study lead number conclusions regarding the use two level distributed intelligence approach using CATV equipment support metropolitan area networking Briefly stated they are Adding control nodes the trunk cable increasing will reduce the DELAY with the number uses subscribers the system being fixed Proper values for the average transmission success rate and average transmission attempts will also tend increase the throughput Increasing the Baud rate tends reduce the Packet time and therefore has positive effect reducing the Waiting queue SIZE which turn reduces the DELAY see Figure Interestingly increasing the Baud rate beyond certain limit tends cause the Waiting queue SIZE increase Consequently the Packet time reduced and the DELAY time increases see Figure Essentially our ability reduce the DELAY time function the trunk cable transmit rate bit rate and the Packet Length Increasing the value will not cause the DELAY time increased because the throughput each branch effectively fixed and has normal distribution probability Therefore the more nodes users branch the less frequently each branch node can send Packet onto branch cable the throughput each branch fixed result the extent that trunk node can handle the traffic the waiting queue size will not increase and the DELAY time will not increase The model clearly demonstrates that our design extendable can increase the number users simply adding trunk control nodes increase the system throughput without increasing the average system DELAY This important result tells that small number trunk nodes which are inexpensive and simple install have dramatic impact overall network performance Our results were obtained using Baud rate Mbps using more realistic figure the range Mbps could only enhance our findings Date Tue Nov GMT Server NCSA Content type text html Last modified Tue Dec GMT
