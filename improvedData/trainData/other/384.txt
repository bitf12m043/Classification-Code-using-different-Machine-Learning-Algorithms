that are trying one written First Rivl and latter Visual Visual Basic The idea this database use many images can handle from the web and run program each one which generates electronic discription the image Then second program will take this database and sample image and generate list the top images with similar descriptions There are several similar databases out there right now Links those will come latter Most these databases use color histograms describe their images color histogram list colors and the amount each color the image Color histograms are good for certain things but little example with demonstrate where they fail Suppose you have picture sunset picture coming this was compaired randomly generated image that resemble the snow you sometimes see but color the result could perfect match obvious that not perfect match but each images has exactly the same amount each color The goal then this database examine other methods compairing images that better represent humans perception similarity Currently have comparision which incorporates positional data well the color data Hopefully have better description this later long can released MIME Version Server CERN Date
