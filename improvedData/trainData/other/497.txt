AcharyaAbstract Current compression formats optimize for either compression editing For example motion JPEG MJPEG provides excellent random and moderate overall compression while MPEG optimizes for compression the expense random access Converting from one format another process called transcoding often desirable over the life video segment this paper show how transcode MPEG video motion JPEG without fully decompressing the MPEG source Our compressed domain transcoding technique differs from previous work because uses new technique that optimized for software implementation and because compare the performance working implementation our compressed domain transcoder instead just counting the number multiplies needed transcode Our experiments show that our compressed domain transcoder times faster than optimized spatial domain transcoder and offers another benefit single parameter can improve the speed transcoding the expense the quality the resulting images This speed quality trade off important many real time applications Acrobat Gzipped postscript SeeMe Immersive Desktop Teleconferencing appear ACM Multimedia Jefferson Han Brian SmithAbstract Current video conferencing systems provide video window user interface This paper presents video conferencing application called SeeMe that provides richer interface SeeMe distributed video conferencing system that allows users connect worlds and interact with other using live video and audio embedded virtual space This paper describes prototype implementation SeeMe including the user interface system architecture and detailed look the enabling technologies Future directions and metaphors for this space are discussed HTML versionAcrobat version Compressed Domain Processing JPEG encoded Images appear Real Time Imaging JournalBrian Smith Lawrence Rowe July Abstract This paper addresses the problem processing motion JPEG video data the compressed domain The operations covered are those where pixel the output image arbitrary linear combination pixels the input image which includes convolution scaling rotation translation morphing interlacing image composition and transcoding This paper further develops approximation technique called condensation improve performance and evaluates condensations terms processing speed and image quality Using condensation motion JPEG video can processed near real time rates current generation workstations Acrobat version Massively Distributed Video File Server Simulation Investigating Intelligent Caching SchemesAlexander Castro Edward Lazzerini Vivekananda Kolla December Abstract This paper the final report graduate multimedia systems course presents the results simulation study that compares the effectivesness different caching schemes within the DVFS architecture HTML versionAcrobat version Survey Compressed Domain Processing TechniquesReconnecting Science and Humanities Digital Libraries University KentukyBrian Smith Oct Abstract This short paper surveys current techniques for compressing compressed multimedia data including compressed audio video and images HTML versionAcrobat version Resolution Independent Video Language Presented ACM Multimedia Jonathan Swartz Brian Smith November Abstract common video processing programmers still implement video programs manipulations arrays pixels This paper presents language extension called Rivl pronounced rival where video first class data type Programs Rivl use high level operators that are independent video resolution and format increasing program portability simplifying code reuse and reducing development time This paper also describes Rivl interpreter and the strategies the interpreter uses optimize Rivl programs These optimizations include classical programming language optimizations such common subexpression elimination and out order execution image and video specific optimizations such computing only those images that will affect the output and optimized memory manager HTML versionAcrobat version Query Humming Musical Information Retrieval Audio Database Presented ACM Multimedia Asif Ghias Jonathan Logan David Chamberlin Brian Smith November Abstract The emergence audio and video data types databases will require new information retrieval methods adapted the specific characteristics and needs these data types effective and natural way querying musical audio database humming the tune song this paper system for querying audio database humming described along with scheme for representing the melodic information song relative pitch changes Relevant difficulties involved with tracking pitch are enumerated along with the approach followed and the performance results system indicating its effectiveness are presented HTML versionAcrobat version Tcl Name Server Presented the Tcl Workshop Peter Liu Brian Smith Lawrence Rowe July Abstract This paper describes general purpose name server for Tcl This name server maintains host addresses and port numbers services running distributed vironment and allows clients query about them starts services demand services are guaranteed available and provides simple authentication protocol for better security The Tcl name server also designed fault tolerant Multiple backup servers can started different hosts and failover occurs when the main server goes down addition the name server provides mechanisms interface with external modules for extending its functionality Acrobat version Tcl Distributed Programming Presented the Tcl Workshop Brian Smith Lawrence Rowe Stephen Yen May Abstract This paper describes Tcl extension Tcl that introduces suite commands for creating client server systems This extended abstract provides examples using Tcl the Tcl RPC abstraction and the Tcl distributed object system Acrobat version Tcl Tutorial Unpublished manuscript Brian Smith Lawrence Rowe September Abstract This document provides tutorial introduction Tcl HTML versionAcrobat version
