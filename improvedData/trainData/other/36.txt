research papers particular topic and present survey current thinking the topic This will take the form survey paper which you will submit This will Postscript document preferably from LaTeX which has the format proper paper other words has introduction various sections bibliography etc You will need present the material clearly which requires first good understanding the subject material not simply matter saying Paper says blah Paper says blah You will need tie the two together that reading your survey gives reader informed insight into the topic While this may appear tough when you are doing you will find that helps you lot down the road There are many topics listed below There are also some topics that stem from the project list You will need choose topic and talk with about will try give you initial paper get started and after that you need track down references from the library and collect more papers expect each survey look about papers Also fine more than one person works the same survey topic and the people topic discuss between themselves However each person must write individual survey paper Query Optimization Join enumeration techniques Selectivity and cost

made economically viable design and implement distributed multimedia information management systems that promise enhance users ability access rich variety audio video and textual information over globally inter connected networks These advances have also resulted networked infrastructure where inter operating components frequently differ capacity orders magnitude Consequently multimedia information management systems the future will required provide services clients highly heterogeneous environments Traditionally since functional interoperability has been the dominant issue heterogeneity has been sufficiently managed using black box abstractions POSIX However since differences performance cannot hidden such abstractions they are inadequate for meeting the real time requirements resource intensive multimedia applications address this performance heterogeneity there trend toward designing configurable applications that can adapt the current environment well the changes resource availability over time Mechanisms for enabling the development such adaptive multimedia applications constitute the focus doctoral research The resource requirements multimedia applications can vary significantly depending presentation processing mechanisms such compression and image processing Consequently have begun investigating adaptive mechanisms for controlling the cost performance tradeoffs presentation processing Specifically have developed the Presentation Processing Engine PPE which provides applications with compression independent means for accessing manipulating and changing the quality media objects The PPE composed modules that implement primitive compression components Huffman coding Discrete Cosine Transform etc and media processing operations scale clip etc allowing basic codec building blocks dynamically configured the PPE can support different codecs switch between resolution levels and provide flexible control over QoS parameters such frame rate spatial resolution and Signal Noise Ratio SNR The PPE implementation bound scalable codec run time based the media object compression format and the application QoS requirements expressed terms frame rate resolution and SNR The implementation can later dynamically reconfigured accommodate dynamic changes resource availability well the QoS requirements applications The fine grained modular architecture allows modules from existing codec implementations suitably extended reused implement new codecs thereby simplifying software development Moreover support for media processing operations can added plugging modules that implement these operations any codec internal implementation advantage fine grained configurability that enables such operations performed semi compressed opposed uncompressed data which often yields significant performance gain Experience developing the PPE toolkit and using implement number codecs has provided some insights into how adaptive multimedia applications should built Whereas object oriented design techniques are powerful tools for building dynamically configurable implementations they carry associated efficiency cost due the procedure call overhead dynamically dispatched method invocations The development modular configurable and efficient presentation processing mechanisms requires carefully engineered balance between the use static and dynamic composition modules Static composition implemented the PPE using parameterized types and inline methods minimizes the efficiency cost while maintaining reusable and extensible architecture For instance image and video compression the operations filter bit stream get some number bits and decode Huffman symbols should statically composed because they are invoked with high frequency but have minimal use for reconfigurability the other hand modules that perform dithering and the inverse discrete cosine transform are good candidates for dynamic configurability because they have multiple implementations with different cost performance tradeoffs effectively balancing static and dynamic binding the PPE implementations JPEG and MPEG decoders have achieved performance that within percent the fastest public domain monolithic implementations The power such dynamically configurable presentation processing environment depends the ability express the configurations well the cost performance tradeoffs propose develop abstract language for specifying protocol configurations via algebraic expressions which the operators represent modules and the operands represent data These representations will used automatic configurator compute appropriate configurations when triggered change user QoS requirements notifications changes resource availability The language can also used specify protocol configurations that can downloaded the client site along with the multimedia data key challenge will make the language flexible enough allow the configuration altered support media processing operations while maintaining consistency with the encode side specification The presentation processing environment integral component the end end systems architecture for distributed multimedia applications being designed the Distributed Multimedia Computing Laboratory the University Texas Austin Specifically propose extend our configurable programming environment support the QoS aware transport protocols and thereby obtain completely integrated configurable protocol stack This stack will support efficient streaming data from the application the network adapter and vice versa well methods for accessing multimedia objects from our multiresolution file server expect that the results this work will substantially advance the state
