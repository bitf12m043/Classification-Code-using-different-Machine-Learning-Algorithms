etc will available online They are accessible from the course home page Most the notes are postscript format you will need access postscript previewer such ghostview postscript printer All the printers the undergraduate labs handle postscript Please contact you experience difficulties Homework sets and handouts will posted periodically your responsibility check for new postings New postings will announced the newsgroup cornell class Public Newsgroup public newsgroup cornell class has been created for technical discussions questions and announcements concerning and Please feel free use this group you would any newsgroup bulletin board Free ranging technical discussions are especially encouraged will try respond questions posted this group within one working day Homework and Exams There will weekly homework assignments consisting problems due Wednesday You can pass class Wednesday morning get the appropriate before without penalty You must pass the not the instructor secretary undergrad office Slip under his door not there collect them shortly after late homework will accepted without good excuse Please clear with the advance possible will have the homework graded and back you Friday Homework must submitted hardcopy form email please Homework assignments and solutions will available online and accessible from the course home page There will two minute prelim exams and one minute cumulative final exam Exams are open book and notes The prelims final and homework will each worth approximately third your grade and follow roughly the same syllabus but faster paced and goes into more depth meant for more theoretically inclined students grad students and undergrads bound for grad school Corrective shifting encouraged the first few weeks you are not sure which course
