Experimental results from testing the developed system are also discussed Human centered systems Lumelsky Cheung Real Time Collision Avoidance Teleoperated Whole Sensitive Robot Arm Manipulators IEEE Trans Systems Man and Cybernetics Vol traditional teleoperation systems the human operator saddled with two distinct tasks moving the robot arm its desired position and avoiding obstacles that can obstruct the arm motion Current research robot teleoperation concentrates providing the operator with much input information about the task site possible using stereo vision contact force feedback These methods presume that the operator capable planning motion for the entire body the robot cluttered environment Studies show however that the operators first cannot address both tasks real time and second are not good generating collision free motion complex environment Recent theoretical work sensor based motion planning suggest that the collision avoidance task can handled automatically thus freeing the operator for global control this end this work considers teleoperation system which makes use whole sensitive arm manipulators whose whole body covered with sensitive skin detect
