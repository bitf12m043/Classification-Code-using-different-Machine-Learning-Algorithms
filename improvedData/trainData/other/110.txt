Operating Systems Assignment Operating Systems Fall Assignment Due November the beginning class Modify Part Assignment that the processes can use signals follows The program should called newsbiffsig and should take three command line parameters These should the same the first three parameters for newsbiff from Assignment The timeout will not used Modify the the program that the original parent has array containing the process IDs all the processes You can use the method you used ring Part Assignment should also print its PID when entered Modify the children that when child receives SIGUSR signal prints statistics about what monitoring including the time started monitoring and the last time the newsgroup changed Modify the original parent that too can receive SIGUSR but realtime signal The value the signal will integer which represents number between and the number newsgroups being monitored This corresponds one the children can interpreted the line number the file containing the list newsgroups monitored the second command line parameter When the original parent receives realtime SIGUSR signal with appropriate value sends SIGUSR signal the appropriate child inappropriate value given wanring message should printed but the program should continue executing When the original parent receives SIGUSR signal kills all the other processes and exits after printing appropriate message Modify Program from PUP just takes command line arguments process and signal value Call this program rtkill sends SIGUSR signal the process with the given value You can use this test your program Now modify the children they keep monitoring forever even after news article comes When news article comes message printed giving the name the newsgroup and the time modification The process then resets resets its copy the time last modification can continue monitoring and report the next change Important this assignment you are creating processes that can live indefinitely long your responsibilty kill off all these processes before you logout This assignment must done machine running Solaris Use pandora machine with name fourxx fivexx Server Dienst MIME version Content type text
