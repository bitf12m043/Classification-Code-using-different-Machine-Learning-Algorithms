compatible Web browser such Netscape then you would see Voronoi Diagram Delaunay Triangulation here The mouse Click the mouse the drawing region add new sites the Voronoi diagram Delaunay triangulation The Voronoi Diagram and Delaunay Triangulation checkboxes These toggle between the Voronoi diagram and the Delaunay triangulation Your current set sites remains the same for both diagrams The Clear button Press this begin new diagram with sites The Show Empty Circles button Press this see the empty circles for your set sites Each Voronoi vertex Delaunay triangle has corresponding empty circumcircle What The Voronoi diagram has the property that for each site clicked with the mouse every point the region around that site closer that site than any the other sites The Delaunay triangulation the geometric dual the Voronoi diagram Alternately can defined triangulation the sites with the additional property that for each triangle the triangulation the circumcircle that triangle empty all other sites These closely related data structures have been found among the most useful data structures the field Computational Geometry Additional Information The actual data structure here Delaunay triangulation The Voronoi diagram built the fly from the Delaunay triangulation The Delaunay triangulation built within large triangle whose vertices are well off screen That why the Delaunay triangulation there are lines heading off the upper left the upper right and down This technique makes the code simpler since otherwise additional code would needed handle new sites that are outside the convex hull the previous sites The algorithm insert new site walk across the triangulation starting from the most recently created triangle until find the triangle that contains the new site This triangle and any adjacent triangles that contain this new site their circumcircle are eliminated and the resulting empty spot retriangulated This site insertion technique commonly called the Bowyer Watson Algorithm The expected time insert new site roughly where the current number sites Author Paul Chew chew cornell edu MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type

This web site collection some the best material that printed during that run well new material from the people that brought you GRAVITY the first place Take look around adding new stuff all the time come back couple weeks look again GravityWeb brought you Matthew Cohen Ross Garmil Noel Rappin and Jason Schneider Thanks for stopping Fine Print This page not publication the Georgia Institute Technology and the Georgia Institute Technology has not has not edited examined the content the author the page are solely responsible for the content addition longer have official connection Brandeis University besides the fact the Brandeis Student Senate Allocations Board funded the magazine and just wouldn Gravity credits page didn mention them One more thing Gravity initial audience were college students Parents your child less mature than your average college freshman which say younger than about ten then they won get all the jokes was movie rate You have been warned Send Feedback
