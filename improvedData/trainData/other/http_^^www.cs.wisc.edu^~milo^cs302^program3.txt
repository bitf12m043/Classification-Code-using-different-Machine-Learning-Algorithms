Program Due Friday October Objective Give the student experience working with and writing functions Program Description Due the great cash register program that you wrote for the restaurant you have earned quite reputation and your skills are high demand large hardware distributor Nails has contracted you write program replace old cash register This program will even greater challenge than the restaurant because number added complications First the price customer pays for each nail decreases the quantity ordered increases This described detail below Second the warehouse has finite number nails stock and your program must not allow the operator place order for more one type nail than stock The cost ordering some number one type nail can calculated from the quantity ordered and the base price each nail The more nails that customer orders the less the customer pays per nail The discount schedule follows First regular price Next discount Next discount After that discount For example the price items cents piece would cents not cents Note that the user orders particular item one point and later orders more the same item she should given the discount she ordered all once Nails sells four types nails Below chart the item number description base cost per nail and quantity hand the warehouse Item Item Description Cost per Nail Number Warehouse Nails Nails Nails Nails Customers can only order the box there are nails the box regardless size Similar the last program you need prompt the user for the order keep track how many each item have been ordered loop until the user asks for the bill display the final bill However this program requires that you prompt the user for the item number and quantity ordered You may design the menu and bill formats yourself but your previous assignment all dollar amounts must formatted decimal places Constants variables should used where appropriate and all input should checked make sure valid the input not valid tell the user and prompt the user for input These statements apply all programs from now Code Provided Since the object this assignment give you practice using functions have provided the basic framework and main function for you build the other functions upon your job complete the functions which fill the program and perform the desired operations You must use the following code your main function with modifications the code Your header comments here include ltiostream const int TRUE const int FALSE Your function prototypes here int main int choice item number int quantity quantity ordered int num ord num ord cumulative number each item ordered int num ord num ord Prompt the user and get the input print menu num ord num ord num ord num ord choice get choice quantity get quantity Process the order place order choice quantity num ord num ord num ord num ord while keep going TRUE Ask the user they want continue Display the bill summarizing the items ordered print bill num ord num ord num ord num ord Functions Write The following list functions that you must write for the assignment Some these procedures will only require call value parameters others will need use call reference parameters you figure out how many and what types the parameters are print menu This function should print the menu and the current subtotal not including tax calculate subtotal This function should compute the subtotal not including tax the items ordered far calculate price This function which will called calculate subtotal should take two arguments quantity ordered particular item and the price the item then computes the cost using the rules the above program description get choice This function should prompt the user for item number You must ensure that the return value legitimate item number the user enters invalid choice error message should printed and the user should reprompted for new number get quantity This function should prompt the user for the quantity the order You must ensure that the return value legitimate quantity remember you have the user enter the number nails desired the number must divisible valid since nails come item packages the user enters invalid choice error message should printed and the user should reprompted for new number place order This function will attempt place the order adjusting the appropriate num ordx the total quantity the item requested greater than the stock hand much possible the order should filled and informative out stock message should displayed This message should display which item was out stock and the quantity which the order was reduced the ordering item causes the available stock drop below items descriptive low item message should printed along with the appropriate item number keep going This function should ask the user whether they would like continue ordering items could ask the user they want print the bill Either way should return TRUE the loop executed again and FALSE otherwise TRUE and FALSE are integer constants that are included the code for main print bill This function should print the number each item ordered only the items which the customer ordered more than zero the subtotal and the final total adding tax way that similar the last program What Turn Once you have your program working you should print sample runs the program Your output file should demonstrate ordering quantities the items such that various discount levels are calculated orders that exceed the available items stock orders that cause stock low message displayed and example where two requests for the same item are handled properly one large request always submit print outs both your source code and your sample program runs and submit electronic copy your source code and executable described previously
