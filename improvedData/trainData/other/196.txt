simulation magnetic levitation train travelling over the sea ofcourse tracks This setting some time the future when Ithaca gets submerged under the sea and everyone lives under water surfacing only catch the Ithaca Transit Train The journey very exciting with lot scenic sights along the way sit back relax and enjoy the ride you may never come back Now for some technical stuff have used most the concepts that learned well some tricks our own This includes parametric surfaces hierarchical modelling texture mapping physics based animation fractals etc The program structured modular way with macros for almost all objects the scene The program itself hierarchical nature Some the interesting modelling that have done Dolphin modelled realistic looking dolphin well almost after hours web surfing for dolphins The main body well the fins and beak were made from parametric surfaces started with kind cylindrical surface flattened bit and then modified the radii different points using manually entered list numbers random colormap gave better appearance order warp the hierarchically modelled object was necessary write our own transforms which physically alter the vertices and then warp them Fractal Tree built recursive tree using loop structures The method used was simple and does not support much randomness the structure the tree But the effect good enough for reasonably complex scene The basic idea make simple branch duplicate around axis and cache this structure for the next generation branch branch made smaller branches Train The train parametrically modelled with tinted glass windows and sliding doors very good example hierarchical modelling has volume rendered flames for jets the engine The motion the train controlled the equation decelerates stop the station and then accelerates off into space courtesy the booster jets Care was taken align the train carriages the tracks all times Texture maps used plenty texture mapping enhance the visual effects though was expensive terms computing power Camera movement This was simplified specifying key positions and then betweening them get the actual and From positions TIME DATE MIME Version Server CERN Date

various inductive classification algorithms These algorithms are intended for research purposes and all use the same basic data format and interface Also included automatic testing software for running learning curves that compare multiple systems and utilities for plotting and statistically evaluating the results This software all available via anonymous ftp Current Algorithms early DNF

absolutely natural And interfaces exist fufill need community and interface share isomorphism the need engage Their meeting point the Internet brings both together into autopoeic unity impossible and self defeating separate them Mark Pesce Internet visionary and creator VRML What stared vision information the Internet has blossomed into the reality true Cyberspace under his guidance has presented his vision VRML numerous occasions the international World Wide Web community Pesce the recipient Meckler Market Impact Award for Virtual Reality and was recently named one Network Computing Most Influential People Networking During their competition Pesce received Honorable Mention from the Ars Electronica Foundation for WebEarth which creates fully interactive real time model the planet from

Testing GroundQuince the Internet Ultimate Wordgame Beta Testers Known Problems Rules the Game Welcome Quince Beta Testers This work progress Some features are obviously not implemented yet Most notably haven written the Quince server what you see just dumb front end Please mail you find any bugs have constructive criticism any kind other than get life Thanks for your feedback Ben Beta Testers Hall Fame The following folks have either found bugs made helpful suggestions leading improvements the game Daniel Prince Chris Lukas Felix Teitelbaum These Quince heros will credited the About screen the final version Known ProblemsNetscape for Unix Deletion from the word list broken Explorer for Win There seem occasional white stripes across the board and the timer they covered the board timer but they show just little the sides Hard describe couldn figure out pattern when they appear and disappear Dan Prince Rules the Game Goal find many words the board you can three minutes Valid words consist sequence neighboring tiles from the board The neighbors tile are the tiles bordering all directions vertically horizontally and diagonally tile may not used spelling word Words must four letters longer playing Euclidian edge tiles have fewer than eight neighbors playing non Euclidian the neighbors edge tile are considered wrap around the board Entering Words Enter words either dragging them out the board typing them into the text box below the board Erroneously entered words can deleted from the word list selecting the mistake and pressing Delete Backspace When dragging out word you can back dragging over the tile just before the tail your selection When dragging out word wou can press and hold the Shift key disable selection this useful when selecting wrapped words Non Euclidian mode Clicking the word list the right the screen displays the word the board Clicking the buttons beneath the board has the following effects flips the board vertically rotates the board clockwise Sequence Play When you first enter Quince dialog box appears asking you provide name for yourself and select language English only first Browse the channels the Quince server with the channel selector When you find game that you what join click the Join button When that game enters new round you can begin playing the conclusion round window will appear that shows The words found each player not found any other player All the words found the Quince server Words found player but not any other player the Quince server are flagged questionable Point summaries for all players You have seconds review the results round before the next round begins Scoring Points are only awarded for words that you find that other player found point for four letter word points for five letter word points for six letter word etc
