Invitation Evaluate Image Database The following letter was mailed potential evaluators from the land grant and cooperative extension service community effort reach others who might find the content the database interest posting this invitation the two lists Apologies those who subscribe both and will receive two invitations Cheers Pamela Pamela Mason Project Manager National Agricultural Library pmason nalusda gov Information Systems Division Phone Baltimore Blvd Phone Beltsville The National Agricultural Library NAL cooperation with the University Pittsburgh School Library and Information Sciences and Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Service has produced horticultural database nearly full color images and their descriptions Two different collections are represented the first volumes Curtis Botanical Magazine and slide collection common landscaping plant pests and diseases from MSU The Curtis collection includes not only the hand colored botanical prints but images the text descriptions for each plant plus the corrected index the volumes The plant pests and diseases collection includes the most commonly seen problems well selected images beneficial insects enable their identification invite you participate the evaluation these two collections both the online and ROM versions during the month period from November through April The image database will reside World Wide Web server the University Pittsburgh that will accessed through MOSAIC client residing the participants computers which can PCs Macintoshes terminals workstations MOSAIC clients are available for all these platforms The image files are being stored TIFF Tagged Image File Format but can requested GIF bit color well JPEG bit color Indeed evaluating what color levels are preferred one the objectives NAL produced ROM with TIFF only images running under Windows will also part the evaluation Beyond agreeing respond the evaluation questionnaire participants should have the following minimum Note users with PCs need only have the one platform evaluate both the online and the ROM version users with Macintoshes terminals workstations would also need have evaluate the ROM version connection the Internet via server modem level higher with VGA Super VGA color monitor preferably Super VGA with Video RAM pixels resolution colors For both the online version plus the ROM version evaluation Macintosh with bit color monitor for online version only terminal device workstation with color monitor capable pixels resolution colors for online version only MOSAIC client appropriate the platform Macintosh Microsoft Windows for ROM version evaluation ROM drive for ROM version evaluation Imaging software minimum JPEG View MOSAIC viewer Windows Paintbrush which supplied part Windows but preferably other imaging software capable handling other image formats would especially like invite the participation organizations which have computer support for bit color true color which requires Video RAM and separate video card This level quality important our evaluation the uses made the images endusers requiring very high resolution and color quality Users who may find these two collections interest range from art horticultural and botanical libraries homeowners teachers master gardeners horticultural specialists and Cooperative Extension Service agents are especially interested having the materials evaluated wide variety participants who may wish incorporate the images into their work reproduce them for other purposes simply use the images and the accompanying descriptions teaching tools for pest identification Our intent evaluate the image resolutions and color levels which are satisfactory for each purpose addition wish receive feedback the indexing images using text descriptors were the terms relevant the various user communities and not what could done improve access Please respond October this invitation may include you your

Mindworks All One Document Image Mgt System SUNNYVALE CALIFORNIA OCT Document image management specialist MindWorks Corp has introduced The Knowledge Builder which the company says complete document image storage and retrieval system According the company the system allows users manage critical information scanning documents high speed and storing them disk Mindworks President Shimi told Newsbytes that unlike other such products available The Knowledge Builder offers total software and hardware system for the desktop including Recollect Software full text retrieval software package with Fuzzy Search desktop scanner and MindBank which operates like hard disk drive with unlimited capacity Many offices can benefit from document imaging solution but find most systems too complicated for their needs The Knowledge Builder was designed with the desktop user mind said Shimi adding that document imaging considerably faster and takes lot less space The bundled Recollect OCR optical character recognition software automatically identifies all the meaningful words and uses them create separate index for each document retrieve documents the user types the word and every document with that word appears screen with bulls eye the pages where those words surface Most importantly adds Shimi you don have keep look out for OCR mistakes low quality documents mis spellings because Recollect Fuzzy Search For instance the system recognizes word such medical modical you can still add modical and retrieve the document The MindBank allows each removable megabyte magnetic cartridge handle pages The first cartridge included with the mechanism well all the interface hardware and driver software needed The MindWorks Scanner which built Ricoh high quality grayscale flat bed with page automatic document feeder The Knowledge Builder Includes the Recollect document image management software Ricoh grayscale desktop scanner with automatic document feeder the MindBank removable magnetic cartridge storage device with one cartridge and SCSI small computer system interface interface kit carries manufacturer suggested list price MindWorks claims that all equipment has been optimized for compatibility and therefore additional drivers cables are needed for simple plug and play The company directly handles technical support and sales The software available separately for
