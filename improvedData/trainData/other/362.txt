dedicated Guide Dog AsTeR Audio System For Technical Readings computing system for rendering technical documents audio AsTeR was developed for his PhD pages audio formatted version the thesis approximately hours produced AsTeR being made available RFB Recordings For the Blind the first computer generated talking book Here the abstract print and here audio formatted version This hypertext document demonstrates the audio renderings generated AsTeR Each example made three components The original LaTeX input The audio formatted output produced AsTeR The speech produced Dectalk and has been digitized bit mulaw AsTeR uses stereo render tables effect that not conveyed the bit mono encoding The visually formatted version produced LaTeX and DVIPS Section simple fractions and expressions This set examples demonstrates the use voice inflection and pauses convey grouping sub expressions succinctly The state the audio formatter point audio space Here audio state was varied along dimension audio space before rendering sub expressions This equivalent parenthesizing the visual context Section superscripts and subscripts convey subscripts superscripts and other visual attributes AsTeR varies audio state along dimension that orthogonal independent the dimension used convey sub expressions This allows the nesting these mutually independent concepts The following examples demonstrate how superscripts and subscripts are rendered unambiguously Section Knuth examples fractions and exponents These examples are taken verbatim from the TeX Book Donald Knuth They are used the TeX Book demonstrate the power the TeX layout operators Notice that all these examples comprise the same symbols but are very different AsTeR renders these examples unambiguously TeX Section continued fraction Moving along dimension audio space defines perceptibly monotonic change This notion perceptible monotonicity vital conveying nesting Audio LaTeX Postscript Section Simple School algebra Here are examples from school algebra Section square roots Notice the choice unambiguous renderings for the following expressions Section Trigonometric identities Written mathematical notation can ambiguous and hard recognize Notice the complete absence parenthesis some the examples below AsTeR uses several heuristics construct the correct tree structure for these expressions Section Logarithms Notice the context specific rendering these expressions when speaking the base the logarithm The renderings are chosen reduce cognitive load log base opposed log the base Section Series Context specific rendering rules allow AsTeR interpret the superscripts these examples exponents Such interpretation not hard wired into the renderings fully customizable the user Section Integrals The first these integrals probably the most innocuous also the most difficult recognize impossible determine the variable integration Section Summations Here are summations Notice that the same expression can written more than one way Section Limits Here are limits Section Cross referenced equations The following example meant illustrate AsTeR rendering cross references and most effective when AsTeR used interactively AsTeR enables the listener give meaningful names cross referenceable objects and uses these names when referring such objects later cross references Section Distance formula Notice that AsTeR produces good intonational structure when speaking text that intermixed with mathematics Audio LaTeX Postscript Section Quantified expression The quantifiers present interesting challenge AsTeR recognizer Audio LaTeX Postscript Section Exponentiation Once again perceptible monotonicity allows AsTeR convey the following examples deeply nested expressions succinctly These examples were produced with the Emacs Calculator full fledged symbolic algebra system AsTeR interfaces directly with this calculator and renders the output just well any document Section generic matrix AsTeR uses stereo effects convey the two dimensional structure the matrix Rendering commences the left and moves progressively right each element any row spoken Audio LaTeX Postscript Section Faa Bruno formula This section presents Faa Bruno formula taken from Knuth Art Computer Programming Vol first heard spoken RFB reader talking book took seconds speak Since the renderings produced AsTeR utilize features the audio space not available human reader still have not met reader who can change the size and shape her head she talks the rendering takes under seconds you will hear soon even this too long you forget the beginning the time you hear the end Later present rendering using variable substitution powerful technique for conveying top level structure complex expressions Notice the proper intonational structure produced for text intermixed with mathematics Audio LaTeXPostscript Audio LaTeX Postscript Here Faa Bruno formula all its glory Audio seconds LaTeX Postscript AsTeR can process complex expressions like the above and upon request replace complex sub expressions with meaningful identifiers Such renderings convey top level structure the listener can then listen the sub expressions separately Since this substitution process performed AsTeR there LaTeX Postscript equivalent for the audio output this case The top level formula audio seconds Lower constraint audio seconds Numerator audio seconds Denominator audio seconds Raman raman crl dec com Last modified Wed Aug MIME Version Server CERN Date Wednesday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last

and present your the proctors Except for clashes the SAK will often the student initials get your SAK soon possible the beginning the semester because grades can recorded for you until assigned When the SAK assigned the computer the proctors will also create manila folder for All quizzes exams and programming assignments done this student will filed this folder Problem Sets You will also given Green Sheet that you have your own record assignments turned Whenever proctor grades program quiz you should ask them also initial the corresponding block your Green Sheet Remember put your SAK the
