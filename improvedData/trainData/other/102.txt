Macintosh user interface The extra files handed out with the project are part this interface You need not look these files the files you are most likely interested are Genetics and Graphics You may also want look the definition the FacingRC function Graphics The code you are write should into Genetics the file containing the main program Note that the printf function not available this assignment Since are using the custom user interface window there console for output IMPORTANT Since this program uses custom Macintosh interface the project folders may become large when you compile the code Try use high density disk with nothing else when you work the program NOTE you retrieved the project files before April the Genes dialog box may not work expected you will have use the Tab key move between fields the dialog box when you type the numbers the wrong numbers will placed the genes array the GetGenes genes call The problem has been corrected you want retrieve the project files again but using the Tab key will work properly Corrections Program Handout page the constant kGridColumnsPlus should kGridColsPlus page typedef int PopulationType kNumKinds Organisms should typedef int PopulationType kNumKindsOrganisms page kMaxUears should kMaxYears page the first paragraph kGridRowsPlus should kGridRowsPlus same correction for kGridColsPlus Click only one these links retrieve the Program folder you will working Program the public labs get the Program Folder you will working your own Mac get the Program Home Folder This folder contains extra library which have already installed the labs but which you will need home Spring pierce cornell edu MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length Last Modified Friday Oct GMT Jun

Office Hours Mon Wed Prerequisites Course Description Introduction Artificial Intelligence This course introduces and studies the core areas artificial intelligence Coverage includes intelligent agents problem solving and search knowledge based systems and inference planning uncertainty learning and perception Text Artificial Intelligence Modern Approach will cover most the text The order reading the schedule and the assigned sections must read before the class lecture The lecture will cover topics from the reading where additional help emphasis and extensions beyond the text are deemed valuable Time will not always allow complete coverage all aspects the reading but you are still expected read and understand the text You will responsible for all text information from assigned reading except where specifically noted examinations Homework Homework will assigned with every lectures Homework questions will come from the text and will due the beginning the following class period Programming Assignments There will approximately four programming assignments covering major themes the class You are your own work although you can discuss approaches with your classmates The will pass off your assignment the computer and you will also hand your documented code Examinations There will midterm and final exam The final comprehensive with emphasis topics not covered the midterm Lateness Homework and assignments get off not handed classtime and los another for each day late thereafter There are free late days However you have good reason for lateness sickness etc something unique from the typical problems the rest your fellow students then you will receive late penalty Just come see the about Please hand late homework the Nothing will accepted after the last day this class Grading Grading will curve Approximate breakdown Midterm Final Programming Assignments Homework you have question concern regarding the grading your homework examinations first talk with the Take day think out the problem first and have good argument for your appeal you still feel that justice has not been done come see ENJOY Approximate Class Schedule Date Reading Assignment and

dimensional real space consider the complete problem minimizing the number misclassified points plane attempting divide into two halfspaces such that each open halfspace contains points mostly This problem equivalent determining plane mid gamma that maximizes the number points satisfying gamma plus the number points satisfying simple but fast algorithm proposed that alternates between minimizing the number misclassified points translation the separating plane and rotation the plane that minimizes weighted average sum the distances the misclassified points the separating plane Existence global solution underlying hybrid minimization problem established Computational comparison with parametric approach solve the complete problem indicates that our approach considerably faster and appears
