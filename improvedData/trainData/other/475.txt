students the opportunitycp match hands dirty some real operating systems research are offering number projects based the plan distributed operating system and the VSTA public micro kernel The main goal these projects get exposure operating systems that are based novel research principles contrast operating systems that are build using more traditional approach like the BSD derivates Linux Mach Plan and VSTA were chosen for very specific research reasons which will become clear when your read their individual sections below major organizational reason was that these operating systems are available for your home where they can peacefully exist with your other architectures Except for some startup activities for the plan project there are other rules these projects than that they should systems projects Projects are being determined cooperation between the faculty involved and the students who want this work Examples projects are distributed rom file server for plan process server for VSTA various device drivers for VSTA kernel packet filter for either the architectures etc The students who want subscribe these projects will need have solid background programming the language know how use development tools like make and have had some exposure the fundamentals operating systems networks and distributed systems Affinity with real system work mandatory Faculty charge Werner Vogels Robbert van Renesse and Thorsten von EickenPLAN Plan distributed system the most general configuration uses three kinds components terminals that sit users desks file servers that store permanent data and CPU servers that provide faster CPUs user authentication and network gateways These components are connected various kinds networks including Ethernet Datakit specially built fiber networks ordinary modem connections and ISDN typical use users interact with applications that run either their terminals CPU servers and the applications get their data from the file servers but also small enough run itself laptop highly configurable escapes from specific models networked workstations and central machine service This project will start with the installation plan file server and make number machines and Sparc stations the department capable booting plan over the network Follow activities can many areas plan but will involve building new servers support remote devices running under Unix connecting your home running plan the departmental plan fileserver through dial services and adding new communication mechanism the plan kernel Other projects can determined cooperations with the researchers Bell Labs VSTa VSTa experimental kernel which attempts blend the design microkernel with the system organization Plan The result small privileged kernel running user mode tasks provide system services such device drivers filesystems and name registry Like Plan each service provides filesystem like interface VSTa was originally developed Andrew Valencia and now placed under GNU copyleft There are many many things still developed for VSTa its network servers are very new and could evaluated and improved device drivers need written there windowing system and many more Also existing mechanisms could replaced improved examples are the now kernel based process management could split into kernel dispatcher and process server Developing remote IPC mechanism another possibility Anything possible this small fits floppies binaries and source code easy understand and very flexible For information about this WWW page contact Werner Vogels Date Mon Jan GMT Server NCSA
