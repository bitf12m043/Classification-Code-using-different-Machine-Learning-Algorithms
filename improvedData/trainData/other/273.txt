Leewwlee Scott Dawsonspdawson And just what this madness the beginning lab deep the heart Upson Hall there were video tapes classroom lectures These tapes were the shelf collecting dust bunnies What were about this Well Brian Smith decided that wanted his lectures put online for his students view and thus began using RIVL compress his videos soon realized that compressing every lecture would take inordinate amount time calculated that could use every machine the computer science department would not take nearly long perform this task decided would fun help Brian out with his problem came with abstract solve his problem all agreed that was good place start After some time and lot labor came with some code and paper based our work which more closely resembles collection notes than coherent piece work kept working have now arrived another version our code This version works much better than before better stronger and faster And this end have written yet another technical paper describe exactly what did and why did and what learn from this Lots now know the intimate details how TCL and RIVL work and why performance suffers when certain things are done Mastering the black art TCL programming actually took the smallest amount time comparison the rest code Squeezing the most performance out single threaded event driven environment given distributed architecture turned out the most time consuming and difficult part the project RPC facilities built into allowed easily perform necessary communication between machines distribute work requests The combination the above scripting environments helped acheive our goals delivering reliable portable high performance MPEG encoding and how does tie with Multimedia Systems Very well The ability rapidly compress video using all available machines makes many new types video processing possible allows animators and movie editors view their videos more often thus shortening development time Because our version parallel MPEG encoding integral part RIVL extremely easy use and how measure success are able compress large video without becoming old and gray will have succeeded and finally how are progressing are finished with the coding state the project Currently are working writing technical report for the project Hopefully can pull the main ideas together better than did earlier Some things that could done make this project better are Make the worker process into daemon process Add support for Multi cast MULVA Name Jerry Seinfeld girlfriend which rhymes with part the female anatomy Courtesy the Junior Mint
