IntroductionProgressive VRML our Progressive VRML paper identify key shortcoming VRML the lack guarantee that VRML scenes are progressive propose solution that transforms arbitrary VRML scene into progressive one employ technique known Hierarchical Uniform Grids achieve this goal The progressive structure generated this algorithm reflects the semantics objects within the scene which allows for generalization and refinement Our approach adds processing step scene creation time but does not require any VRML client modification Authors Isaac Sheldon Adam Seligman and Damon Hastings The paper
