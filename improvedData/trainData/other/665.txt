leave his mailbox instead mine Assigned Homeworks Homework Due Apr points same Text You can use Fig Prob strongly urge you through the example covering Figs Homework Due Apr points same Text shown large brackets Using the algorithm Fig carry out the following addition binary Assume bits precision bits after decimal You must show all steps Using the algorithm Fig carry out the following multiplication binary Assume bits precision bits after decimal You must show all steps Homework Due Mar points shown large brackets Text Text Text Consider the following gate called IMPLICATION gate which implements the following function Can you build invertor using this gate this gate universal Explain your answer added this problem beyond the ones mentioned class Using the laws Boolean algebra page without using truth tables prove the following These are known Consensus Theorems Note refers complement invert and Note The redundant term are also called consensus Note Earlier prior Mar part had typo The correct third term was mistyped However Note had the proper redundant term Use the consensus theorems prove the following ABCD CDE BCE BCE ACDE Use the consensus theorem prove the following addition theorem Use the theorems above show Show the PLA implementation similar Figs the following functions ABD ABD Text Using flip flops and other combinational logic elemnts needed construct the following bit counter which has the following counting sequence bit register which has the initial content and shifts left each clock tick starting the least significant bit position bit register which has the initial content and shifts right each clock tick starting the most significant bit position Note Prior Mar there was typo here and incorrectly said least significant instead most significant You cannot shift right starting least significant bit position Modify the state diagram Fig for the following modifed traffic controler North South road has priority over East West road NSlite should normally green and trun red only there car waiting road and there car road there car waiting road for more than mins The EWlite should turn red there car road there car waiting road for more than mins Homework Due Mar points same the problem rating given Text All problems from the Text Chapter through through through Homework Due Feb points shown large brackets Problem Exercise
