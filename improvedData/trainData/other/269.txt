process digitized sound data stream and determine time indices that correspond the beginning spoken word Background One part the process subtitling film adding words translate piece into different language known timing Timing consists person group people listening the soundtrack and marking the starting and ending times sentences These times are then used computer along with translation overlay text the film There are couple methods timing One method listen the soundtrack and whenever one hears the start sentence presses key mark the time computer known spacebar method This method common among hobbyists due minimal equipment requirements has drawbacks though can fairly accurate method timing but only with large amount practice The most experienced timers that use this method average around spending three times the running time the actual film for two hour film they would need spend about six hours doing timing second method digitize the soundtrack and then step through the soundtrack discrete intervals second second This method slower than the spacebar method with ratio about However has advantage that the skill requirement lower the end accuracy higher and the method highly parallel Because the information stored digitally can divided among multiple people group three lesser skilled people using this method can achieve the more skilled timer With the second method the amount sound person needs listen less than second theorize that all the data the human needs make this decision present the data stream Thus should possible for computer simulate the decision making analyzing the same data Project The goal this project determine how accurately neural net can simulate human recognizing the start speech means comparison also analyze the accuracy dumb algorithm This method measure relative difference intensity between sound segments with the start word being marked when the intensity goes over threshold This classically fooled loud sound effects and background music can also fooled depending sentence begins with hard soft consonant hypothesize that neural net should able account for these two problems Back top Maintained Jerry Hsu cornell edu

racquetball regular basis Several faculty and students get together Tuesday and Thursday afternoons the Student Rec Center near the Florida Pool play Racquetball Any and all are welcome join our group but you must let know least one day advance that you will playing The coordinator games will send message out all members the group one day before games determine the number courts that are needed Courts will then reserved for play The skill level those currently playing varies widely from starting players very skilled none should feel that they will not welcome play mail alias has been created allow members the group communicate with each other concerning who playing and are playing you would like receive these messages you should send mail message majordomo cis ufl edu with the following
