programs allowing major Computer Science this University were started and the Department started teaching Computer Science Cairns The Department therefore one the youngest and the most vibrant Department Computer Science Australia All members the staff are capable and enthusiastic and most are young recent PhDs The Department has attracted staff members from different continents the world including Asia Australia Europe North America and South Africa The staff student relations the Department are excellent and the learning environment superb given the small class sizes and the emphasis small class tutorials and practicals The graduates the Department are working variety environments Australia and overseas major Commonwealth Government Departments major banks universities Bell Laboratories the USA software development companies Australia and overseas BMC Software USA The academic departments the University are reviewed external experts every years recent review May the Department was highly supportive the Department teaching and research Further information about the review available from the Department Other information the Department Computer Science Cairns James

edge magnitude information edge accessed The array edge should accessed edge row col snake points never settle down that problem can happen not necessarily bug might mean that there are too many snake points What happens two consecutive snake points move the same pixel There problem with the Williams and Shah algorithm this case That the curvature each those points will undefined one follows the algorithm the letter deal with that you can the following When computing the curvature point check whether the ith point coincides with the previous and the next points does set the curvature the ith point BIGC where BIGC large constant This will ensure that points and are coincident then for all four points and the curvature larger than neighbors condition the algorithm will fail and beta won changed Make sure you use this condition and not What snake point goes the old position point for all modulo the total number snake points You not have deal with this problem ever happens when you are developing your code during the demo you can simply stop the snake and restart with new snake MoveSnakePoint does the parameter new refer Points jmin and the parameter index the index into the points array the point vector moved jmin The parameter new the first parameter MoveSnakePoint type Point should contain the value the coordinates the new position point But you are moving say points you should NOT change points directly and then call MoveSnakePoint points points num points Rather you should create temporary Point variable say loc min define loc min row and loc min col appropriately and then call MoveSnakePoint loc min points num points MoveSnakePoint itself supposed copy the coordinates from loc min points addition moving the point the display When calculating the derivatives for Econt and Ecurv how should the boundary conditions when and handled For this assignment you can assume all contours are closed and therefore you can use modulo arithmetic when dealing with snaxel indices Hence adjacent The snake program interface displays poor colors what wrong Your window manager may setting default color settings differently than needed the snakes program Install different fvwmrc file for example change these settings How Econt calculated page the Williams and Shah paper there description how compute this term There error however Since want this measure distance you should use normalize this value the range divide the largest value this expression from the values computed for the possible positions the neighborhood centered the current point For both the continuity and curvature energies the paper states that the value point under consideration should divided the largest value the neighborhood which the point may move interpreting this mean the largest value the neighborhood around the original snake point Someone else interpreted this mean you figure out the largest value the neighborhood for the point under consideration For example the snake point the point under consideration the question which largest value use The one that computed using the neighborhood around compute based upon the neighborhood the point under consideration for example wanted normalize the value computed would figure out the largest value becuase that neighborhood Which correct The way read the paper should normalized using the largest value from the values the neighborhood centered not Otherwise each point would normalized differently making comparison difficult
