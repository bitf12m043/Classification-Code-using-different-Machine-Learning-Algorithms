algorithm for clustering edges that represent single object Performance Simulations Investigate how high performance vision and image processing applications perform modern architectures vision applications tend use large data structures images that can exhibit both good and bad spatial locality Ideally one would have processor simulator that would configureable cache size cache associativity memory size processor speed instruction set etc The simulator should able generate statistics such cache hit miss ratio Hopefully the simulator could extended simulate Shared Memory Multiprocessor SMMP Starting from scratch will very hard may better adapt existing program our needs Starting points Image Databases There currently project here Cornell develop general purpose image database that will allow intelligent searching for images based large number image features need people implement different measures for basics such texture pattern matching face recognition Starting points the competitors Camera Gaze Control Create adapt existing object tracking algorithm that the output can used control the pan tilt positions desktop camera The robotics lab developing relatively cheap pan tilt hardware for standard CCD camera would like the user able click portion the image and have the camera pan tilt keep the object centered focus Find Cool Use for Stereo Vision Existing programs allow generate good depth maps near real time speeds FPS would like someone create cute application using the robots some other platform that would use the depth maps perform some task such navigation collision avoidance these are not actually the same currently the easiest way for the robot navigate for until crashes into something back little then turn Stereo Camera Calibration Develop robust reliable procedure for calibrating pair stereo cameras using feedback loop between the output the cameras they view test pattern and their next adjusted view Text Segmentation Develop system that can detect text image series images This not the same OCR where one tries take image printed text and recover the text rather you should concentrate how find text image Typical examples texts that one might want identify from video signal include the bylines network news and scores and player stats from sports games Human Face Segmentation Basically find the objects scene that look like human faces How many people are there How certain this answer Starting point Univ Maryland also work CMU Kanade group MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length

Massachusetts Amherst Real time database systems has been active research area recent times spite this their applicability specific applications has not been well studied attempt rectify this shortcoming studying two applications detail These applications are particular interest because lot concepts have been developed assuming certain characteristics application for real time database systems not properly understood how these constraints are derived from application needs will discuss the data and transaction characteristics the two applications detail and see the protocols and features developed the research have applicability these applications Publications Bhaskar Purimetla Rajendran Sivasankaran Jack Stankovic Study Distributed Real Time Active Database Applications IEEE
