topics covered the course They fall into three major areas Finite Automata and Regular SetsPushdown Automata and Context Free LanguagesTuring Machines and Effective Computability Each area will comprise roughly third the course The entire body lecture notes available postscript format clicking here you can obtain hardcopy for from Linda Mardel The lecture notes are soon published textbook Springer Verlag For that reason very interested your comments and suggestions particular will pay you for each mistake typo misspelling etc that you find that don already know about known errata Suggested supplementary readings are taken from the text Hopcroft and Ullman Introduction Automata Theory Languages and Computation Addison Wesley addition these specific topics important that the end the course you have good general understanding what means for set regular context free recursive and the capabilities finite automata pushdown automata and Turing machines and how describe sets using regular expressions and context free grammars Finite Automata and Regular Sets Chps Lecture Course Roadmap and Historical Perspective Lecture Operations Sets Lecture Finite Automata and Regular Sets
