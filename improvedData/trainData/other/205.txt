Program Program MarathonDue Date Friday amGrade your final grade Text Covered Chp and Background June your gallant instructor will running his second marathon the annual Grandma Marathon Duluth Minnesota you not familiar with what marathon ancient Greece soldier ran from the town Marathon Athens bring news Greek victory over the Persians Aside why this news was important that ran the entire distance non stop instead leasurely taking his time and stopping celebrate with the odd amphora wine along the way topic much historical debate The Marathon Athens distance actually less than miles the modern distance miles yards miles was established the London Olympics and represents the distance from the royal castle Windsor the Olympic stadium Although the marathon considered the highlight and final track and field event the Summer Olympic Games there are men and women records for this event because each course different Problem Description You have been hired the Grandma Marathon Organizing Committee write the computer software for processing the finishing times for this year event the finish line the name and finishing time each runner entered into computer Your program will read these values for all the runners and compute various statistics about the race including the fastest two times Your program should first prompt the user enter the total number runners the marathon and then prompt them enter the name and finishing time each runner entered the same line shown below Name Hours Minutes Seconds For example Ima Slug Oprah Winfry Hillary Clinton Clark Kent Gareth Bestor Notes The name entered CHARACTER string surrounded single quotes and most characters long The finishing time entered three INTEGERs separated spaces Runners are entered particular order particular they are not entered ascending descending order finishing times There will always least two runners Your program must read all this data and compute the following statistics Total number runners Name the first place runner Name the second place runner Average finishing time displayed Hours Minutes Seconds format Standard deviation finishing times displayed Hours Minutes Seconds format Average pace measured minutes per mile and displayed Minutes Seconds format Example For the race data given above your program should display hint use this check your results Total number runners First place Clark Kent Second place Oprah Winfry Average finishing time Standard Deviation Average pace minute mile Don worry you get extra spaces your output shown above Optional Exercise use formatted output described Chapter remove these spaces Calculations For most the calculations you have first convert the finishing times from Hours Minutes Seconds format the total number seconds For displaying some the results such the average finishing time standard deviation and average pace you will have convert value total number seconds back into Hours Minutes Seconds Hint you may find the MOD function useful for converting value from total number seconds hours minutes and seconds All your results must dislayed INTEGERs rounded the nearest second determine the first and second place winners you must remember the lowest and second lowest finishing times total number seconds and the corresponding names Then each time you read new runner check see their time less than either these values and assign them accordingly compute the average finishing time first add all the finishing times total number seconds compute the standard deviation add all the finishing time values squared When you have obtained these two sums use the following formulae compute the mean and standard deviation where the total number runners Although you will compute the mean and standard deviation total number seconds they must displayed Hours Minutes Seconds format INTEGERs rounded the nearest second Runners typically measure their pace minutes per mile minute mile which the average number minutes takes run one mile Use the following formula compute the average pace The pace must displayed Minutes Seconds format INTEGERs rounded the nearest second What Hand Hand this assignment online copying your FORTRAN source code file program for and the compiled executable file program exe your handin directory You also have hand printed copy your FORTRAN source code file and printed copy the output when your program run with the five different sets test data given the gradesheet Gradesheet The following gradesheet will used grade this assignment Please take close look make sure you everything that required Note that you will graded correct output for the five different sets input values given below before handing you must run your program with these values and manually check that your program gives the correct results all cases You must enter each runner the order given Correct Output Julie Lewis John Wiley Gareth Bestor Barbara McQueen Diane Meyers Julie Lewis Barbara McQueen John

prompts for the total number runners and the data for each runner Meaningful display the results Implementation Correct implementation formulas Correct use THEN ELSE END statement Correct use END loop
