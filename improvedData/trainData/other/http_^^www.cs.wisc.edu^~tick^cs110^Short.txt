the Login prompt type NEWUSER the password prompt just hit enter The computer will prompt you for other info When done wait five ten minutes and then log normally will tell you how when newuser running You now Windows Click the picture that says DOS PROMPT new window will appear black this window disappears backgrounded NOT click the Dos Prompt again that creates completely seperate window Instead hold down the ALT key new window will pop Still holding down ALT keep pressing TAB until the DOS Prompt appears the new window Then let both keys The black window should now say something like This your prompt the name the disk drive you currently going all our work from drive type and hit return The prompt should now say The tells which directory drive What directory Think disk large box Rather than throwing every single program the same box like organize them somehow can put smaller boxes inside the large box and label them For example might have box called public which will house all the programs that everyone can use might have another box called handin which where put all the programs handed directory just sort box that holds programs and other directories Let into the handin directory Type handin tick YourLoginName where YourLoginName whatever name you type your login prompt This the directory where you hand everything our box analogy our disk has main box inside which has box handin Inside handin bunch boxes one which tick and again once box inside tick YourLoginName Note that you are now this directory You can tell because your prompt now says public tickYourLoginName assignment tells you copy something for example prog dat from public directory use with your program then type copy public tick DataName where DataName the name the data file you supposed copy prog dat Note the following there space between dat and the period yes the period part the line NOT FORGET THAT SECOND PERIOD copy command that copies program from one place another the program this case prog dat found public tick you have use the full path name here this will always the directory for things give you use The second argument tells which directory the program copied into The period shorthand which means whatever directory you now typing copy public tick prog dat handin tick YourLoginName would the exact same thing GENERAL NOTE type dir any time anywhere will show you what the current directory IMPORTANT All filenames and directories can have more than letters spaces files also add dot followed three other letters such dat prog dat When you type dir the first letters will show one column followed second column which lists the last three Directories will have DIR listed the right the name they don have letter extensions INSANELY IMPORTANT NOTE One the other columns shows the time your program was last modified This indication when you did your program you modify your program after the due date able tell you type dir more only one screen worth will printed time Once you hit the keyboard print the next screen worth listings Lastly you add path name right after dir list that directory instead the current one Now you ready type your program prog for Type edit ProgramName where ProgramName the name the program you wish write NOTE your program MUST end with the for extension You can now type the blue screen the same you were using typewriter which effectively what this Remember Fortran spacing rules for example using tabs make sure code line starts before column When done click File then click the ssave option under File file again and select exit You back the black screen the command line now you got program written Fortran You need translate into machine language the computer can run now you got compile Type programname compile there are errors the screen will say some sort errors warnings you must compile again WARNING There one machine that set incorrectly located right next the far dor the lab you using that machine will claim upon compiling that can find llibfore lib every time you compile will ask you where find when asks type fortran lib llibfore lib and should work fine Doing dir should reveal two new files were created They have the same name your program but with obj and exe extension The obj isn important machine language with some info missing see notes for explanation The exe however the finished machine language program You can now run typing the programname you can leave out the exe you wish Errors may still occur the program may not doing what you want you have edit the program again and compile again once you done editing you wish delete the obj file which you don need typedel prog obj general del file will delete file DON DELETE THE FOR EXE you may need them for later programs plus your hard copy gets lost need the file Lastly test your programs once they handed they need there print something out type print file will prompt you for which printer print use LPT located the opposite side the hall Type exit get rid the DOS window Now exit windows log out DON FORGET THIS LAST STEP you you leave your account open access anyone plus you loading down the system Copyright copy Jeff
