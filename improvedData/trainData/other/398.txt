computers multicomputers While multicomputers have number attractive features one difficulty these systems that computing the presence faults This problem particularly acute massively parallel architectures employing very large numbers nodes The objective this research develop practical algorithms for fault tolerant unicast and multicast routing wormhole routed multicomputers addition seek obtain tight theoretical bounds the number faults that can tolerated with given set resources particular students and are developing efficient fault tolerant adaptive routing algorithms for the mesh and torus topologies Several technical reports and papers describing recent results are available postscript number Harvey Mudd students have taken active role this research project They are Eli Brandt Tom Hehre Kevin Watkins Andrew Hutchings and Mark Reyes Tom Hehre and Kevin Watkins developed the Mesh Architecture Routing Simulator MARS MARS event driven simulation package for studying wormhole routed meshes MARS implemented and has windows based graphical user interface that allows visualization network traffic and other network characteristics MARS allows easy definition router architectures routing algorithms and selection policies Virtual channels are implemented with demand based multiplexing and the number internal channels and other router characteristics are user definable number router and channel latency parameters are also user definable order facilitate fair comparisons between algorithms based different routing models example the MARS interface shown
