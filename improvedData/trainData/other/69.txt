supposed take over the world and the definitive answer object technology according Microsoft course OLE also the basis for the next version Windows the real bit from which code named Cairo OLE open standard depending who you ask you ask Microsoft open but you ask anyone else they will probably disagree Microsoft has made information OLE available through the internet OpenDoc Overview OpenDoc backed many companies the computer industry The standard controlled organization called Labs OpenDoc positioned component architecture that exceeds the capabilities Microsoft OLE OpenDoc Supporters These are the companies that have officially jumped the OpenDoc bandwagon Each the companies and organizations have pledged use contributed time money and helped implement AppleIBM Corp LabsNovell WordPerfectTaligent Inc AdobeBorlandMicrosoft Foundation Classes MFC Overview The Foundation classes are thin wrapper around the Windows bit bit API These classes also have utility classes that implement some base functionality that could prove useful during project For example linked list one the implemented classes addition the other features the best part MFC the cross platform aspect the libraries the libraries are used for application development almost all that required for Mac compliant version simple recompile the code Most platform differences are hidden within MFC Foundation Class SupportersMicrosoftThe gatekeeper the libraries All development done here also ships with their Visual product SymantecSymantec has licensed the classes from Microsoft ship them with their compiler product BorlandBorland has added compiler support for the class libraries support the non standard extensions Microsoft used Their compiler does not ship with the libraries included Borland ships their own class libraries Object Windows Libraries with their compiler Last updated September jmm cornell edu MIME Version Server CERN Date Monday Jan GMT Content Type text html Content Length

Throughput Computing Research High Throughput Computing HTC For many experimental scientists scientific progress and quality research are strongly linked computing throughput other words most scientists are concerned with how many floating point operation per month per year they can extract from their computing environment rather than the number such operations the environment can provide them per second minute Floating point operations per second FLOPS has been the yardstick used most High Performance Computing HPC efforts evaluate their systems Little attention been devoted the computing community environments that can deliver large amounts processing capacity over long periods time refer such environments High Throughput Computing HTC environments The key HTC effective management and exploitation all available computing resources Since the computing needs most scientists can satisfied these days commodity CPUs and memory high efficiency not playing major role HTC environment The main challenge typical HTC environment faces how maximize the amount resources accessible its customers Distributed ownership computing resources the major obstacle such environment has overcome order expand the pool resources can draw from Recent trends the cost performance ratio computer hardware have placed the control ownership over powerful computing resources the hands individuals and small groups These distributed owners will willing include their resources HTC environment only after they are convinced that their needs will addressed and their rights protected For more than decade the Condor team the Computer Sciences Department the University Wisconsin Madison has been developing and evaluating mechanisms and policies that support HTC large collections distributively owned heterogeneous computing resources The Condor Team Publications Slides from various presentations Checkpointing
