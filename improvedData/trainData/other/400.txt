approach robot exploration and mapping and demonstrate and evaluate its effectiveness controlling physical mobile robots The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy approach robot exploration and mapping has been developed the context simulated robot and tested simulated environments with very simple models sensorimotor errors Kuipers and Levitt Kuipers and Byun Physical implementations aspects the SSH approach have been built other researchers but they not provide adequate demonstration its strengths adequate analysis its conditions applicability The proposed research will extend the SSH Mapping theory from its original prototypical version version adequate for handling real sensorimotor interaction with real office environment The extended theory will implemented physical robot explore previously unknown environment and create SSH spatial description the environment Demonstration and evaluation the SSH approach will performed along several its features First design and implement set reactive control laws which are robust towards sensor and effector inadequacies real world and useful for defining distinctive places and paths Second investigate the ability the SSH approach build finite topological graph description continuous environment adequate for path finding based the robot continuous interaction with its environment through its control laws Third will demonstrate and evaluate the ability the SSH approach build detailed metrical map and its use disambiguating topological ambiguities discriminating alternative routes different length and identifying shortcuts Fourth will investigate the utility the map for model based control providing expectation driven sensing strategy Interested dissertation committee WYL Date Wed Jan GMT Server NCSA Last modified Mon Oct GMT

responsible for reading the line information will announce when there something new for you read This document prepared get you started that you can access the line information Fortunately not difficult you shouldn have any trouble line documents mean information that accessible using the computers the lab This information available via the World Wide Web WWW which system for browsing line documents through simple hypertext interface you see word picture underlined highlighted you can click get more information You may have already used the most common WWW browser Netscape not you will learn use very quickly Where startFirst the lab which located room the Computer Sciences and Statistics building Dayton Street you enter the building from Dayton Street straight ahead all the way past the two elevators the water fountain Take drink Turn left and the lab the Vectra lab the first room your left Find vacant seat The first step activate your account There are instructions for this posted the walls but really isn too hard simply type newuser followed the ENTER key the WILEY login prompt When prompted for password simply hit the ENTER key Now follow the instructions entering information such your student number sure not type the dashes your number Check the information and read the policies for your account Finally you will prompted choose password You will need this password login the system the future PLEASE choose one that you can remember not generally good idea write your password down case you forget but necessary write down safe place You will probably want

annoyingly ask you you plan using any floppy disks during this session Hit indicate you aren Now Microsoft Windows will start you will see lots little pictures icons all over the screen Each icon represents program you can run this class will primarily using the programs associated with the following three icons Borland Netscape big and File Manager you are totally clueless when comes Microsoft Windows this would excellent time through the Windows tutorial that exists line You will have view this using the Netscape browser program order accomplish this follow these steps run Netscape with any other applications program double click the Netscape icon the Networking menu You will looking the Department Home Page home page basically place the World Wide Web which has links other places actual documents with information Click Fall Classes Any underlined words denote link the WWW You will now the Course Listing Home Page Click Tony Silva and that gets you home page Now choose bookmarks and then add bookmarks from the menu This will add home page your hotlist that can easily accessed from any point your Internet Surfing going the bookmarks menu The hardest part now over You have all the course information your fingertips Look home page carefully has office hours syllabus and schedule grading policy late policy class handout tutorials important software like Microsoft Windows even has your first program assignment Before you begin this assignment would your benifit browse through the Introduction Microsoft Windows and Introduction Borland turorials Netscape has another neat feature built into the back button This situated the upper left corner the Netscape window just below the file menu Clicking this button returns you previous documents you had been viewing Important note that Program due next Tuesday sure take look while still Netscape recommend that you get started the tutorials and familiarize yourselves the Borland environment right away This what the first week all about the more time you spend now the more you will learn about the system that later the semester you can concentrate entirely the harder programming assignments you have any questions problems feel absolutely free ask one the duty consultants for help These are people probably sitting computer wearing yellow name badges There should always consultants the lab Consultants are duty Monday Friday Saturday and Sunday Good luck and have great semester
