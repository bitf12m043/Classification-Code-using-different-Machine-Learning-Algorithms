technology This fall graduate seminar that will examine Java including the Java programming language network security design distributed applets Java virtual machines and Java implementations compilers interpreters and special hardware Other Java related topics are both welcome and encouraged This course will taugh research seminar First the professors are not Java experts but expect learning along with the students What you get out this course will experience studying and developing new ideas interactioning with colleagues and new insight into Java only plan lecture for few weeks present overview Java Then students will work two month long group projects Students will evaluated the oral and written presentation their project This offering NOT core course Background MaterialThere text for this course although there are countless Java books bookstores Most these books were written very quickly and are very superficial The Addison Wesley series the official Sun reference books Java and are much better than the average but see below many them are line Implementation ReaderA collection papers Java implementation available DoIT Line DocumentationSun maintains web site that contains considerable Java documentation Its URL http java sun com This site contains considerable Java documentation including The Java Language Specification The Virtual Machine SpecificationThe Java API Application Programmer Interface libraries SpecificationJava Language Tutorial Security related papers Dean Felten Wallach Java Security From HotJava Netscape and Beyond Frank Yellin Low Level Security Java JavaSoft Frequently Asked Questions Applet Security The web also can provide Java Development Kit for writing and running Java applications This kit already installed for the SPARCstations the department java The department also has the source the JDK You can also run Java applets recent versions Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer Sample Java applets are available from many places Sun has collection http java sun com java sun com applets index html that not typo The largest collection Java programs and applets appears http www gamelan com

Tools and Results for Java Programs Evaluation Java Security Investigate compiling other languages the Java Subset Java would very interesting Investigate was formalizing the security requirements language and system and ways automatically generating verifying implementations Any security related topic Investigate the cost making the primitive types int float bool etc objects and eliminating the dual type systems particular Java static typing sufficient alleviate the overheads Java EEL Dynamic compilation Can the language mandated tests array bounds null pointer etc scheduled unused
