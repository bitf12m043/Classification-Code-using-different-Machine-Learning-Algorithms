information applies all programs for this course Programming Guidelines Postscript PDFSubmission Instructions Postscript PDF you are using Unix you will need write Makefile Here little introduction chapter the GNU Make manual and two example Makefiles that you can download and modify suit your needs Introduction Makefiles postscript simple Makefile that will get you going professional strength Makefile that can tailored build your programs many different systems with different compilers you are using the GNU compiler then you will also find the following two page GNU Debugger gdb reference card handy You may also find useful use the Revision Control System RCS You can download short description how get started You should also see the online man pages for RCS commands rcs rcsdiff GDB

provides point and click client interface for non linemode browsers for accessing the various Webster dictionary services the Internet First type the word for which you want the definition the search window and hit return Words the resulting definition are hypertext linked back into the dictionary allowing you use your mouse access the definition those related and unrelated words you misspell the word the webster server may offer list close matches alternatives you know the prefix the word list potential matches may obtained entering after the prefix alpha This Web interface rather simple minded all but very short words are hyperlinked back the dictionary Because doesn know the words are actually the dictionary these links may fail particular prefix suffix removal find the root word neither performed the Web interface nor the Webster server the link for alphabetically doesn work since the webster server only has entry for alphabetic and not smart enough find the root The job root extraction should done the Webster server just spell correction feedback done now for alphebetic Note that you can use cut and paste extract the root and paste into the search window you just have click hold drag instead single click The webster client program used internally this interface afs cmu edu user bsy bin webster you want use from outside the WWW The webster database server that contacts configurable via your webster file see the man page for details The webster client currently uses citi umich edu its webster server The webster client used use one several webster servers depending which responds first Unfortunately all other webster servers have been shut down you know any webster protocol servers that may used please let know Other dictionaries the Web include the
