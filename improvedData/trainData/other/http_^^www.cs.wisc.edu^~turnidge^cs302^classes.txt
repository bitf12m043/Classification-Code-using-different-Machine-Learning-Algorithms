which studied last week One the most apparent differences between class and struct that addition having data members like struct class can have member functions methods can think about these member functions being operations that all objects that belong the class can For example imagine that wanted augment our Alien struct that declared last week that every Alien capable giving greeting would declare our class const int MAXSTR class Alien public char name MAXSTR char homePlanet MAXSTR int numLegs int isDeadly void greet char who Notice that have added additional member called greet the class Alien Unlike the other members this member not declared variable array This member prototype for function which takes array characters and produces return value have also added the word public which will talk about later Now prototype only half function need give function definition could look like this void Alien greet char who cout Hello who name name and from homePlanet nLet friends for ever This looks lot like normal function definition have return type void have parameter list char who and have some code making the function body What different the function name Alien greet our class declaration our prototype has only the name greet What going here Well possible that more than one class might have method member function called greet For example there might Robot class and might have greet method too order specify which greet method are providing the body for need give the class name That why our function called Alien greet You can read this name meaning the greet method for the Alien class The thing called the scope resolution operator This because used specify that its second operand this case greet the one specified the scope its first operand this case Alien The used whenever want grab part class will see additional uses for the operator later Some you might saying hold one second are using the variables name and homePlanet the greet method without them being declared the method body This will see what this means soon have defined the greet method for the Alien class Now just need call Suppose have couple Aliens this appears somewhere maybe main Alien yoda Alien darth have not yet talked about initializing objects For the time being assume that yoda has name Yoda and home planet Dagobah and darth has name Lord Vader and home planet the Death Star can call the greet functions for both the code this appears somewhere maybe main yoda greet Dad darth greet Mom call method for particular object variable using the dot operator have done this before with file streams remember cin getline and fin getline have also seen this way accessing the data members structs Basically the dot operator used whenever want grab piece object contrast with scope resolution operator The first line says call the greet method for the yoda object with the argument Dad the second line says call the greet method for the darth object with the argument Mom You can also think these lines being like messages the objects first tell yoda greet Dad and then tell darth greet Mom The reason that call variables like yoda and darth objects that they are abstract sense entities that can receive messages and interact with each other When make the calls the variables name and homePlanet will correspond whichever object makes the call When yoda asked greet Dad will from Dagobah When darth asked greet Mom will from the Death Star The above two calls generate the screen output Hello Dad name Yoda and from Dagobah Let friends for ever Hello Mom name Lord Vader and from the Death Star Let friends for ever Exercise extend the class declaration include method called mutate which takes integer and returns nothing Write method definition for mutate which adds its integer argument the aliens number legs mutating should accept negative arguments time should Alien numLegs drop below zero Solution ConstructorsBelow this point these notes are written for lecture They are very terse and will likely not make sense leaving them here because doesn make sense remove them First example class Alien public char name MAXSTR char homePlanet MAXSTR int numLegs int isDeadly Alien char char home int legs int deadly void greet char who void mutate int moreLegs Alien Alien char char home int legs int deadly strcpy name strcpy homePlanet home numLegs legs isDeadly deadly Overloaded class Alien public char name MAXSTR char homePlanet MAXSTR int numLegs int isDeadly Alien Alien char char home int legs int deadly void greet char who void mutate int moreLegs Alien Alien set reasonable defaults name homePlanet numLegs isDeadly Alien Alien char char home int legs int deadly strcpy name strcpy homePlanet home numLegs legs isDeadly deadly Point why don call strcpy name instead Two constructors Talk about how decide which call parameters types args Typical overloaded function Show example main some other function Alien Generra init values calls lame constructor Alien Gamera Gamera Tokyo Points ponder Why doesn Generra have the What would happen did args constructor called default constructor Good idea have one because you probably will want when you make array classes You can use assign one whole class another Generra Gamera You can also call the constructor explicitly make anaonymous value certain type and assign Generra Alien Home Alien Example where use resolve name clash constructor Alien Alien char name char homePlanet int numLegs int isDeadly strcpy Alien name name strcpy Alien homePlanet homePlanet Alien numLegs numLegs Alien isDeadly isDeadly Constant member class Alien public const int killer const int lamb Can use the killer and lamb constants our Alien methods Can also use them calls Alien Yoda Yoda Dagobah Alien killer This way can hide the magic number Point why can this with non constants Friday ClassPublic PrivateTalk about the separation implementation and interface would help have example two different ways doing the same thing Preferably something have shown before Define impl and intf Idea provide common interface that hides the details implementation This way can replace code later Can also avoid things like yoda numLegs semantic error Tell them how Tell them what means Give some decls Show accessors constructors void Alien Read char YorN cout cin cin getline name cout cin getline homePlanet cout cin numLegs cout cin YorN isDeadly toupper YorN Contrast with void ReadInAlien Alien lifeForm char YorN cout cin cin getline lifeForm name cout cin getline lifeForm homePlanet cout cin lifeForm numLegs cout cin YorN lifeForm isDeadly toupper YorN Accessor Functions Tips Make all member variables private define accessor functions use the assignment operator ReworksSkyline Alien catalog
