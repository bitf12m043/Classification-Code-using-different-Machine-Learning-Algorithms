Bob Colwell assures that don need establish position industry probably right Sometimes dream about having less stressful job where can hours week world class work rather than work hours week Intel spending most that time doing cruft But probably fooling myself like take some time and think new ideas Intel has eaten whole slew the ideas that had stored when came out and working Intel gives you very little opportunity for the type deep though that least need come with good ideas very much afraid that not back school will reproduce the job path many the people see around Intel some whom are Fellows who are now idea consumers instead idea generators course have some hope that Intel new Microcomputer Research Labs which member will provide the sort opportunity for deep thought that think need want work one two more chips after but then would like have the opportunity retire university would like some day home Canada only meant work the years But there aren many jobs for computer designers Canada having gives option left because wife Now that wife has left return Because don now won ever assming eventually have family Because like thinking deeply People used accuse being too ivory tower fact they probably still But least after years industry have probably proven that not one Those who can those who can teach decide become professor Because would like something more lasting for the world than just design CPUs Because think that there are fundamental things learned from CPU design that apply other areas like psychology government etc Because want have role designing the artificial intelligences that will eventually replace mankind the moment this most needs faster computers Sob Story sometimes feel that missed out lot university career Undergrad McGill After discovering computers learning how skip classes and losing scholarship worked way through with succession computer jobs working hours week First Job Phase years The Little Software House the Prairie must have been the only person move Urbana without knowing that the University Illinois was there Masters Illinois was about leave Urbana when Wen Mei Hwu arrived Since shared interest out order processor design stayed worked through the classes part time the rate one semester not too heavy load but enough distract from work Gould Motorola After years this then wife finally finished her undergraduate degree Deal was she could apply for jobs anyplace the she wanted long there was good computer architecture school for But she didn really look very hard and she chose Chicago that time did not have any good schools for Computer Architecture she moved Chicago and went part time work VLSI design class Bell Labs Indian Hill facility that UIUC would pay for trips Chicago visit her But this didn work eventually chose the quickest topic could finish and get out Snoopy Cache Test and test and set without Excessive Bus Contention proving that have some interest and knowledge and memory ordering Even though all actual research notebooks had been out order CPU design specifically HaRRM Hardware Register Renaming Mechanism which addressed what Wen Mei told was the worst timing path HPSm removing the associative logic from the register file and having explicit renaming stage Overall the machine was working looked lot like the end was looking mechanisms for Convergent Code which Gus Uht reminds Minimal Control Dependencies mechanism avoid throwing away work after branch misprediction that turns out independent the path through the branch was hoping combine this with extremely long trace cache lines get high ILP Although always had this feeling that ILP overrated and that out order itself non superscalar situation has advantages There was hidden aspect research that didn understand when was there but which was later explained chose work with Wen Mei because HPSm but became apparent after while that Wen Mei was moving towards compilers and VLIW and away from dynamic scheduling Wen mei first had number hardware students who dropped off after while was his last hardware student because was part time and paying own way Intel Finally got with quick and dirty cache coherence topic and came Intel basically consumed whole slew ideas that had stored But Intel does not give you space think new things New ideas were not wanted throughout most the project biggest memory job interview with Gould was Steve Bunch saying You smart guy don need any more smart people with lots new ideas the sexy new CPU The best new idea came with since joining Intel was the use redundant arithmetic index the cache had been thinking about using redundant arithmetic general purpose CPU for last two years Illinois ever since took classes with Robertson but had not solved the memory indexing problem until read the paper without Carry Propagation two Spaniards who didn realize what they had done shortly after came Intel consider that first wholly Intel idea Why have talked much about university Basically because never got full time student through own fault and obstreperousness except for the last spurt research never got enjoy being university But really enjoyed that first taste academic research and frankly feel bit cheated also got great big chip shoulder because never did well undergrad never published the stuff worked hard have never published classy setting and have real proof that smart guy Sure worked and think contributed lot probably think contributed more than did there were hell lot good people working but again there proof What did Bob Glenn Dave Mike Andy Why the only architect not ever get called the front the room receive plaque Yes paranoid and insecure But least honest about Maybe felt secure would become complacent and never come with original idea again guess that way showing that smart that there are some ideas that are incontrovertibly mine Fear however quite bit scared returning school don like doing multiple classes once like doing one thing intensely crash courses time management skills need work not not very good deferring interest topic seized idea will exhaust myself working for upto hours straight and often not able make class the next morning Even when there test Hell often don even know what day can hope that ten years experience industry has tamed this tendency bit but know don know that want tamed actually quite afraid that will get into trouble with the class requirements Doing world class research not afraid although somewhat afraid that may have told the various members committee what think their work Hell Bottom line glutton for punishment Moreover about punish you with the image below Does anyone have recommendations for good image editor Why doesn HTML support vector non pixel art Advice say not did Finish undergrad quickly possible Yes know frustrating boring classes when you much want investigate new ideas Tough out all possible Get the interesting stuff quickly possible But you are like square peg round hole persevere Choose your goals and work towards them Don let failing your classes losing your scholarship having your ideas laughed get you down all smart people just drift around according what interesting ideas their betters and mentors give them Which makes life easy because then you are working what your betters and mentors think you should But rebels choose our own topics are lucky choose the right ones like hire some smart non conformists like But hard find them mass resumes All you can sort grade point averages classes degrees you don fit make yourself stand out Flaunt your successes Maybe even your failures got first good job with resume that contained graph pointing out the bimodal distribution grades Create portfolio the work that you have done outside formal settings Engage shameless self promotion even isn something you feel comfortable with The drones anyway with their old biy networks and references and honour societies Beat them their own game and then beat them where counts producing successful products Use the Web The Internet wonderfully democratic place The drones may say that There isn anything good comp arch your favorite newsgroup But there just may someone like reading making note the people who make sense irrespective whether they come from fancy gradschool podunk chop shop Shop around When had problems with undergrad thought that all universities were the same All taught the same way But not necessarily true There are different styles learning Some people like multiple classes Some like like crash courses Some people like homework Others like exams American schools emphasize classes British schools emphasize lecture series and examinations Some law schools use the case method Others use conventional classes Shop around for the style education that you best with One the tragedies modern life the number people who have been turned off the first style education they encountered but who would have done well with another There single right style But then again useless cry about the mismatch Solve shouldn say drones above pejorative mean drones the people for whom everything seems easy who well everything they but who not choose what they but rather drift according whatever placed front them opposed troublemakers like Can you tell that resent them But beware the drones are not necessarily any less smart less creative than the rebels fact they may well smarter maybe they aren drifting but really have intellectual goals they want acheive but about things the easy way Certainly they are luckier than rebels But they aren any less creative and they aren any less smart And they contribute much more society rebels easy for rebel fall into the trap thinking that rebellion itself valuable isn least not necessarily All want say that you rebellious nature doesn have all nothing Work with your nature take advantage Beat the drones their own game and when you run the show change the rules And never let the bastards get you down Header glew public html RCS higher education html glew Exp
