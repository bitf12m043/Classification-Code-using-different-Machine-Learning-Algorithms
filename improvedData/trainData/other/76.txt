conference complementarity problems was held the Johns Hopkins University Baltimore from November The meeting was attended over researchers from around the world including attendees from Australia Belgium Canada the Czech Republic Denmark Finland Germany Great Britain India Italy Japan the Netherlands Norway Portugal Sweden and the United States The meeting was organized with the aim bringing together researchers the mathematical programming aspects complementarity problems and experts variety applications areas The purpose the meeting was create increased cross fertilization and communication between these areas particular better understanding and appreciation the different aspects that each these areas considers expected beneficial for the effective solution practical complementarity problems arising from applied disciplines such believe that the meeting was great success With more than three decades research the subject complementarity problems has become well established and fruitful discipline within mathematical programming Sources complementarity problems are diverse and include many problems engineering economics and the sciences Several monographs and surveys have documented the basic theory algorithms and applications complementarity problems and their role optimization theory The meeting started with overview the complementarity field which stage new web site CPNET http www wisc edu cpnet was announced When completed this site will eventually contain date information upcoming conferences the area list active researchers and pointers work algorithms applications and software Currently the page contains list all the researchers present the conference along with papers and software that outline some developments the area This includes the growing collection test problems for MCP MCPLIB and the COMPLEMENTARITY TOOLBOX suite programs and routines for use conjunction with MATLAB hoped that CPNET will allow this collection grow considerably include many new algorithms and application problems There are some pointers extensions modeling software that allow real applications formulated standard modeling languages There were various themes that developed during the meeting Several speakers introduced new extensions the basic framework and cited applications that needed such extensions Some new theoretical results were outlined relating vertical horizontal and extended linear complementarity problems along with several ideas unify these areas Other speakers considered noncooperative and stochastic game theory and outlined existence results and algorithms for their solution Variational and bimatrix inequalities also drew the attention several talks Merit functions and smoothing techniques were also popular topics One extension that received considerable attention was the Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints MPEC Several algorithms were given for the solution these problems and lots discussion resulted during application talks relating reformulating problems into this framework This appears very fruitful area for future research Contact problems are rich source complementarity problems For these problems complementarity the result the contact condition which stipulates that the gap between two objects contact either zero the pressure between them zero Classical obstacle problems were extended include the effects convection and diffusion interesting use complementarity contact mechanics arises robot design and key features the problem that can modeled the new framework include sliding friction and rigid body properties Structural mechanics has also used complementarity models studies material elasticity and plasticity Several very informative and interesting talks opened these areas the field general Complementarity has been used economics for long time The renowned Walrasian law supply and demand general equilibrium theory states that either there excess supply the price the corresponding good zero Several extensions this basic idea were outlined talks that dealt with oligopolistic equilibria integrated assessment for problems energy modeling relocation effects due the European Common Market and the National Energy Modeling System NEMS The use similar models for traffic assignment was also outlined this area dynamic models are becoming important and several new ideas for tolling and congestion analysis were presented the meeting Several new algorithmic developments were outlined the meeting Some these involved the traditional simplicial and pivotal based techniques while others used novel reformulations the complementarity problem both smooth and nonsmooth systems nonlinear equations very popular approach takes systems nonsmooth equations and applies smoothing that traditional Newton based techniques could applied Still other methods were based quadratic programming and proximal points formulations New computational extensions were also outlined Several talks introduced new merit functions that will prove useful error analysis and future algorithmic design conclusion the meeting showed that the field complementarity research burgeoning area There are already many interesting algorithms for solving complementarity problems along with fairly sophisticated techniques for analysis and computation The growth the number new application areas that use this framework will require even more sophisticated solution techniques Furthermore clear that even more applications will developed that use complementarity modeling some form another significant portion which was made possible this meeting refereed proceedings this meeting will published SIAM Further developments this area will undoubtedly reported the next International Conference Complementarity Problems Planning already under way and the conference tentatively set for July held Madison Wisconsin Michael Ferris Computer
