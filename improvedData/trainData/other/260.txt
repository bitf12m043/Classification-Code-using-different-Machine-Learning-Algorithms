Frequently Asked Questions FAQ Frequently Asked Questions FAQ This FAQ came about because problems that many students were encountering not comprehensive and will probably constantly evolving grouped which language being used and there list non language specific problems the end you don find what you want here ask consultant you are consultant you can mail perkinst wisc edu Common Problems Using the Borland IDE and the Language Compiler and Linker Errors When Borland refuses run your program Runtime Errors Crashes floating point errors protection faults errors that occur while your program running Borland IDE problems Difficulties with your program files project files windows the screen editor general problems with the mechanics using the Borland IDE Input Output Errors Problems with reading input sending output files etc just not working FORTRAN hint How write and run programs efficiently Miscellaneous Problems Printing mail Disk Quotas Compiler and Linker Errors Error Statement missing Fix Click this message and will get the highlighted line your source file This line the line immediately before not ended with semicolon All lines code except statements which can followed compound statements else etc should have mark the end the statement Error Declaration syntax error Fix this line isn declaring variable then the problem definitely that some variable declaration immediately before missing semicolon Otherwise this may still the problem but you may have also done something else like missed comma between variable names put space variable name variables must one word Error Unable assign char char Fix char variable single keystroke like note the single quotes char variable array characters string like hello there note the double quotes For beginner purposes view them entirely different animals particular not the same takes byte memory whereas stored byte containing followed byte containing the end string message The program seemed nearly working before but now gets all sorts errors involving ostreams when run linking the program without compiling the source code Click inside the cpp window and select Project Compile Then try running again Why get that annoying linker error OwlMain Chances are that you have not created opened project You must this through the Project menu you cannot through the File menu Once you have created opened project make sure that you choose the Build All option under the Project menu you don chances are that you will get many more linker errors program source file has extension and the Borland compiler complains when attempt compile How make file This caused forgetting choose the Advanced option when creating project file The easiest way fix this problem select the source code file name the project window you will know selected because will highlighted Press the right mouse button and menu will pop Choose Edit Node Attributes from this menu will produce window that will allow you change the default extension for the file choose cpp you have saved the program source file with the extension you will want resave the file with cpp extension Use the Save option under the File menu Run time Errors program gives some weird Windows error message when run What can Unfortunately this very wide open problem and can caused numerous things Common problems are the following trying use pointer that points NULL accessing elements beyond the bounds array creating large data structures like dimensional integer arrays local variables functions running out disk space etc Unfortunately some these problems don exhibit consistent behavior but most times you can use the interactive debugger figure out what the problem program starts run but then stops and get window that tells General Protection Exception This error caused access memory outside legal bounds for your program often means you used array and tried access set elements outside the array bounds For instance you have array you may have asked for Another possible cause for this error that you are using pointers and you attempted access pointer that had not yet been initialized find such error often easiest use the debugger trace down the line code that causes the memory error While the programming running get floating point underflow floating point division zero and the program stops floating point underflow can caused uninitialized variables you declare some floats doubles and don set them some value before you use them they may start out with huge tiny values that cause errors calculations The simple fix initialize all your floats zero division zero error may not obvious look the code but can occur when variables have unexpected values Often you will performing some calculation inside loop and the loop goes one place too far the very first very last iterations form special cases resulting division zero Unless you can spot right away the best way find such error probably use the debugger track down the offending line code Then you can run the program again and use the watch feature view the variables involved and see what causes things run afoul Borland IDE Errors Why see nothing when open project you open existing project and all you see the background the Borland IDE choose the Project option under the View menu This will show you the project window Why there nothing project window Good question could accidental thing fluke The way fix this select the Target option under the Project menu The easy thing use the same name the project minus the ide extension Then you through the same process creating project When try open program file cpp extension get some weird message about truncating lines What with that Another good question more than likely you named your project with cpp extension The default extension for project file ide and should left this way Unfortunately questionable you will able get your source program back Ask consultant attempt salvage your code from network backups program source file has extension and the Borland compiler complains when attempt compile How make file This caused forgetting choose the Advanced option when creating project file The easiest way fix this problem select the source code file name the project window you will know selected because will highlighted Press the right mouse button and menu will pop Choose Edit Node Attributes from this menu will produce window that will allow you change the default extension for the file choose cpp you have saved the program source file with the extension you will want resave the file with cpp extension Use the Save option under the File menu Borland always crashes when attempt run How can fix this would recommend that you ask consultant this There are Borland configuration files that have apparently been corrupted Input Output Errors trying cin getline but not working When run the program just goes right the getline weren there This very common problem There can problems when you mix cin and cin getline input statements program The cin function will take input but leaves newline character the input buffer getline call follow cin then the getline will read this single newline character and stop will appear the getline read nothing all whenever you have getline following cin you must clear the newline character from the buffer either with cin ignore another cin getline This should course placed between the cin and the cin getline that really takes input Here example that suffers from this error cin GolfScore cin getline PlayerName MAX STR this case the PlayerName would just get the null string because the newline character left the input buffer the cin Here are the two ways problem can fixed cin GolfScore cin ignore MAX STR cin getline PlayerName MAX STR cin GolfScore cin getline dummy buffer MAX STR cin getline PlayerName MAX STR program runs correctly and now redirecting the output file When ran the program the first time worked great but now when run get the same output the first time matter how change the input What the problem Chance are that you still have the output file open from the first time you ran the program Windows basically will lock files that are open windows that you cannot overwrite the contents the file remedy this just close the output file after you have printed find out you have the output file open choose the Window menu will tell you exactly what you have open When run program and redirect the output file the output file always empty Why you are also redirecting the input you want check make sure that you have the path name the file typed correctly you have the path name hard coded your program you want make sure that you have used two backslashes for every one your path For example the following file public jjason myfile would coded follows your program ifstream input public jjason myfile Also make sure that you copied the input file from instructor that you copied the correct directory trying output with cout but get compiler error telling Illegal structure operation cout used print strings and numbers and such but you want print out some more complex object you must use other means For instance you have defined class foo you may have given output method with prints some its internal variables other messages class foo public void Output When you want print out such object students sometimes make the mistake making the call the Output member part cout foo FooA cout The Output function works its own and should not part cout Despite the odd notation cout cout Just Not Working you really having difficulties remember that there are consultants the lab help you most hours the day They keep consultant sign top the computer which they are working and wear nametags they are easy spot program doesn give the results had hoped for program runs but does some really strange things Help Your best bet run the interactive debugger Consultants are also able help you but chances are they will run the debugger themselves Since you are the one most familiar with your program you would the one most likely spot errors quickly using the debugger recommend learning the basic features the debugger stepping through program and viewing the contents variables FORTRANA little suggestion make you more productive When going through the program development cycle helps immensely you have two windows open with the DOS prompt one window you can use the editor work your program The other one you can leave the DOS prompt that you can compile and run the program This alleviates the need exit the editor every time you want compile your program Note make sure that you save your program the editor before attempting compile the other window MiscellaneousI have run out disk space How get more You will want use the File Manager delete files from your user directory drive First all don delete the files that start with the letters these are used the Borland compiler Likely candidates are files with the following extensions exe obj csm and bak These files are easy reproduce word warning only get rid files that you know you created were created your behalf for instance compiling your program you are not sure what you can delete ask consultant have been locked out account How gain access you type your login password wrong enough times you will locked out the network for around minutes You will have wait until that time has expired before you can log again get message that have exceeded maximum logins and refused access How can log This caused you being logged more than one computer Make sure that you are not logged into any other machines this includes machines other places which you have logged into the Computer Science network Also you were working machine that crashed and you immediately attempted log into another computer you need log into the machine that crashed and log out before you can log into another machine have been locked out email How gain access From Parter you type your email password wrong enough times kerberos locks the entry You should the systems lab get unlocked There are free computers the lab Are there others can use Try the computers the DoIT lab the basement the Computer Sciences building There should information outside the lab how get the DoIT lab send job the printer but never prints out What wrong There are two likely causes this The first that the print server not working The second that you have exceeded your printer quota Whatever the problem don continue sending your files the printer until you know the cause the problem Use the Check Print Queues program the Administration group view Run this program and make sure all the laser printers are selected the box next the printer names should have not click the box and one will appear Clicking the check queues button will show you list all the printers and the documents waiting printed each You can spot your print jobs because they are labelled with your username the queue are exceedingly long and not moving inform consultant the UNIX there may problem with the printers The Check Print Queues program also allows you check your paper quota clicking the check quota button you have already printed many pages you are allowed you must the Computer Systems Lab and pay for more paper credited your account would like forward mail student mail account that possible course You will want use the User Util program mentioned above After you log using your login and your mail password from the menu you can select forward your mail Just follow the directions course this assumes that you have memorized your student mail address You can also use this program stop any forwarding mail have forwarded mail and would like able check from the lab that possible What you need into the mail program Eudora Select the Special menu and from there select the Configuration option the box labeled POP Account type the mail account which you would like check This next part VERY important Again select the Special menu and this time select the Switches option Make sure that the box marked Leave Mail Server has you don have this box selected when you check your mail from the lab will download all the mail the mailbox your user directory This means that you will not able check that mail from anywhere else Trust learned this one the hard way Last Modified February Ted Perkins perkinst wisc edu
