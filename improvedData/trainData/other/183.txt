can already find useful information this major upgrade Introduction This page describes the UNITY Verifier system system interactive symbolic model checker for finite state UNITY programs and propositional UNITY properties you would like know what model checking for UNITY all about you may want have look our brief System Introduction Documentation The following documents deal with various aspects the system Model Checking for UNITY Technical Report Department Computer Sciences The University Texas Austin December The report describes the system and the input language Available are abstract and compressed postscript version the report The System User Interface Manual explains how install and use the current revision the system available dvi version without illustrations and compressed postscript version containing few screen shots the system interface Software Distribution The current public beta release the system available revision two forms the executable archive contains executable version the system built for Sun SPARC workstations running SunOS and the Windows System YOU NEED OSF MOTIF LICENSE FOR ANY COMPUTER YOU WANT RUN THIS SOFTWARE You can download the executable archive the source archive contains the system sources needed build the system The sources are written entirely using the GNU suite development tools Window System Release and OSF Motif Version THE SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE GNU PUBLIC LICENSE YOU NEED THE WINDOWS AND MOTIF HEADER FILES AND LIBRARIES INSTALLED YOUR COMPUTER WELL OSF MOTIF LICENSE ABLE BUILD THE SYSTEM You can download the source archive you download the system and use would very much like hear from you Please send your feedback bug reports suggestions the author markus utexas edu Thank you Version History Following listing all distribution releases the system with short description changes made each release Revision June Minor revision fixed few bugs the parser related type checking and constant folding Revision March Extended the input language the interleaved directive specify interleaved BDD indices Also fixed bug that caused the parser complain about conflicting cases assigment statements when there were none Until updated version the language reference manual will available you can find more detailed information about the language extension here Revision February Fixed few problems with the parser internal memory management and handling empty sections and made the program View button the property info dialog work Revision January Added missing initialization the memory statistics routines that could lead erroneous statistics the memory dialog and fixed bug with the strongest invariant computation that could cause problems the presence declared specification variables that were not modified the program they were declared Revision January Some minor fixes interface problems that had gone unnoticed when switched from Motif Motif The documantation remains unchanged Revision December The initial distribution release This page was last updated May Markus Kaltenbach markus utexas edu Date Tue Jan GMT Server Stronghold Ben SSL Apache Content type text

virtual address gigabytes real memory page tables are stored real memory page tables can start any byte boundary Show how virtual address gets mapped into real address sure show how the various fields each address are interpreted the size each field bits the maximum number entries each table could hold and the maximum size possible for each table bytes Draw and label diagram answer this question The Segment Table has entries times bits bytes has maximum size Each Page Table has entries times bits rounded bits bytes has maximum size Note that the extra bits each PTE might used for control
