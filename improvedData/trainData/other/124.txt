Web Server Introduction One the design features the Web hypertext Hypertext the idea creating link from part one document another part document either the same document different one The concept really different than cross reference but the referenced document available the user instant hypertext system some standard method specifying links must created The designers the Web decided that for their needs the most appropriate way specify the start link was mark section document with special tags see the HTML tutorial Specifying the destination the link was more complicated because each part each document the internet had have unique name solve the problem they created the Uniform Resource Identifier URI specification The syntax URIs was designed Extensible That new kinds links can added necessary Complete possible specify any naming scheme within URI Printable Any URI uses only bit ASCII characters and designed easily readable The URI specification was turn used write specifications for the naming documents services available through existing internet protocols These initial specifications were named Uniform Resource Locators URLs this document discuss some the commonly used URL specifications The http server and relative URLs When people talk about putting documents the Web they are usually referring putting their document the namespace Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP server HTTP was designed satisfy the curious needs the Web namely the quick anonymous retrieval documents The http server provides each user with their own Web namespace starting the directory public html The server has the permissions any other user the files this directory must readable any user will describe what the full URL this namespace later this document URLs are similar pathnames file system and just with pathnames possible construct relative URLs Unix shell pathnames name files relative working directory URLs name documents relative the URL the document link being made from Roughly speaking when you make link from document document and you leave out parts the URL for those parts will copied from the URL that was used retrieve For example have document called home html and want make link from another document called todo html can simply use the relative URL todo html have third document subdirectory data called results html can use the relative URL data results html link from home html URLs generally use the character separate directory names just like Unix link from data results html home html you could use the relative URL home html The name the http server uses for each user web names pace username Remember that this points the subdirectory username public html and not username you wanted link home page from document your directory you could use the relative URL keeper keeper html Full URLs link file service that not the http server you need know its full URL link documents other http servers full URL looks like the following http fqdn pathname Where fqdn the fully qualified domain name www wisc edu Sometimes server will running port other than the standard one which case you follow the fqdn with colon and the port number monty wisc edu The full URL for the home page the department http www wisc edu The home page located the root the tree The full URL for home page http www wisc edu keeper keeper html Another useful URL type ftp which allows you link files anonymous FTP servers The format exactly the same http URLs except http becomes ftp The URL for the condor directory the FTP server ftp ftp wisc edu condor Access Control Tricks and Details Linking parts documents create link specific part document that document must written HTML and contain named anchor see the tutorial The URL would simply the URL the file followed hash mark and the name the anchor the anchor the same document the URL just anchorname Access Control The http server provides access control system similar the access control lists AFS but because all the files are already AFS you should use rather than the server protect your files Mapping documents directories Normally when the server gets request for the URL directory returns list files However file named index html exists the directory sent instead The home page stored the file index html the root directory Many people like make link from index html their home page username html index html that when the URL http www wisc edu username requested their home page returned Searching directly with URLs Each Web browser has method for sending search string remote server and many Web services rely this search string Luckily the method used for sending the string translate and append the URL the service preceded question mark The translation changes spaces plus signs and encodes other seldom used special characters hexadecimal The finger script our server uses this feature make link that fingers user from document our server you can use the relative URL cgi bin finger username Related
