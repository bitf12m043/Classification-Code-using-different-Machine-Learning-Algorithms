Horus group communication toolkit also developed Cornell University Visit the Horus page for more information about Horus papers group communication and pointers other sites with related information Language support Note that the current distribution primarily provides support for applications developed the programming language However interfaces several other languages are under developlment and will made available soon You can check out our roadmap for future development see what our plans are Ensemble implemented the Objective Caml programming language dialect The use supports variety optimizations that enable Ensemble achieve communication latencies order magnitude faster than Horus although the current distribution does not enable these optimizations Ensemble supports interface prototype appears the current distribution This interface being expanded upon provide complete support for applications Also under development are two interfaces the Horus Object Tools HOT interface and Electra Corba object request broker interface Java Finally work being interface Ensemble Java and wrap Ensemble Netscape plug Building applications with Ensemble For application builder Ensemble provides library protocols that can used for quickly building complex distributed applications application registers event handlers with Ensemble and then the Ensemble protocols handle the details reliably sending and receiving messages transferring state implementing security detecting failures and managing reconfigurations the system research tool For distributed systems researcher Ensemble highly modular and reconfigurable toolkit The high level protocols provided applications are really stacks tiny protocol layers These protocol layers each implement several simple properties they are composed provide sets high level properties such total ordering security virtual synchrony etc Individual layers can modified rebuilt experiment with new properties change the performance characteristics the system This makes Ensemble very flexible platform which research Other InformationGeneral information about Ensemble Find out more about Horus Our roadmap for future development

Environment Starting the Borland IDE start the Borland IDE Integrated Developement Environment double click the Borland icon the Apps program group Double click this icon the Apps program group After few moments the following window will appear This the starting window the Borland IDE this integrated environment you will able write compile debug and run programs you have run Borland before you may may not see the noname cpp window There are three main areas interest the Borland IDE the menu bar the top the window the speed bar which just below the menu bar and the status bar the bottom the window The menu bar allows you perform all the actions necessary for creating and running programs The most important menus are the File menu which allows you Open Close and Save programs and the Debug menu from which you can run program you have written The Edit and Search give usefull commands for editing programs such copying deleting searching and replacing test The bottom half the Window menu allows switch any window you have open which can useful you have many windows open and the screen cluttered hard find what you want All these options will make more sense you once you have starting writing programs and working with the Borland IDE You are encouraged look through the menus and try out the different features you find there Next briefly discuss the speed bar and status bar after which will walking you through writing and running program The speed bar the row buttons found just below the menu bar The speed bar allows quick access just click button commonly used operations such opening closing files and running programs Every button the speed bar corresponds one the commands the menus the purpose the speed bar allow you access common commands quickly with just the press the button the other hand not all menu commands have corresponding speed bar button sometimes necessary use the menus Besides the Open and Save buttons Run the lightning bolt probably gets the most use The Rebuild All button can sometimes fix linker errors that you get when you try run your program This especially the case you have worked your program another lab such DoIT and then brought the program back the lab Since computers can crash have errors that force reboot wise save your work frequently Make habit clicking that little Save button now and again The Status Bar found the bottom the IDE window When you move the mouse over any button hold down the button any menu item the status bar will display brief description that item function Below have pointed the mouse the Run button the speedbar and the status bar the bottom describing the function that button When you are editing program the status bar has several other useful displays shown below Starting from the left tells the line and column location the cursor whether are Insert Overwrite mode and whether the file has been modified since was last saved mentioned above good habit save your files frequently Most the time you will want your editing Insert mode this the familiar mode from most word processors you want you can toggle between Insert and Overwrite mode using the insert key located your keyboard the group above the arrow keys Next topic Starting New ProgramUp Introduction Borland
