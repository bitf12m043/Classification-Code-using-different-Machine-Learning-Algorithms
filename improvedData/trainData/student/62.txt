reasoning uses incomplete knowledge compute description the possible behaviors for dynamic systems For complex systems containing large number variables and constraints the simulation frequently intractable results large incomprehensible behavioral description Abstraction and aggregation techniques are required during the simulation eliminate irrelevant details and focus the simulation the distinctions interest developing abstraction and aggregation techniques which address some these problems particular interested abstraction techniques which can automatically applied during simulation This will facilitate the integration qualitative simulation techniques with large scale knowledge bases and automatic model building The following techniques have been developed address these issues
