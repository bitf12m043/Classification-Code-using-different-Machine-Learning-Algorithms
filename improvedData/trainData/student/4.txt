Implementing compiler using just the preprocessor Delegating work your project partners Setting off airport metal detectors The ins and outs existence graduate student the Department Computer Science the University Wisconsin Madison new advisor Guri Sohi and are looking into methods alleviating data dependences Multiscalar programs using the distributed register file Multiscalar programs are all that and side curly fries have Physics from Yale University and advanced degree nail design from Valley Beauty School Physics interesting but beauty degree much more practical live with girlfriend Marci and our two cats Joe and Charlie Marci also went Yale and now she getting masters public policy from LaFollette Institute One day she going president the meantime she likes solve linear regression problems try out wacky recipes she finds magazines and watch Party Five like eggplant which most people think weird Anyway promised the ins and outs Subba Out officemates Mac Daddy and
