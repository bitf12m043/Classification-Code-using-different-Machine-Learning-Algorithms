Inverse Projection ProblemAbstract important problem computer vision recovering the structure scene and the position the observer within from one more projected images This essentially the inverse projection problem Existing Structure From Motion SFM techniques solve this problem examining multiple images projected from rigid scene However SFM has not been used extensively practice because these techniques are very sensitive noise not accurately model optical projection restrict the position the observer and the structure the scene research uses new technique for solving the inverse projection problem called the Concurrent Projector Model which makes assumptions about the scene other than rigid and assumptions about the position the observer This technique uses projector based model projection instead the camera based model traditionally used SFM result the algorithm defined for any geometric transformation any dimension not just perspective projection For given transformation and dimension the algorithm identifies when the inverse projection problem under constrained and specifies the minimum number points and images required solve The Concurrent Projector Model can also examine additional points and images minimize the types projection errors that occur real world applications allowing the projectors approximately intersect This technique currently being applied the problem robot navigation and exploration both determine the position robot unknown environment and the same time map this environment Advisor Prof Charles DyerResearch Interests

engineering courses prior computer programming experience required and only basic knowledge computers assumed The material covered enables students write simple computer programs solve engineering problems elementary courses All programming done FORTRAN This course intended for students who received little programming instruction high school These sections are taught entirely the FORTRAN programming language and are intended primarily for engineering students and non computer science majors Sections and Home PageCS Algebraic Language Programming Section FORTRAN Construction algorithms
