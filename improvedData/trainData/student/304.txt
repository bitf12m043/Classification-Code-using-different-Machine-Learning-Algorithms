Computing the Georgia Institute Technology member the Software Visualization Group the Graphics Visualization and Usability Center Tech His advisor John Stasko The focus Scott research Internet information monitoring and display Scott received his undergraduate degree from the University North Carolina Chapel Hill His major was mathematical sciences with emphasis computer science For his honors project helped design and implement PGOMS interface for creating GOMS models Scott has worked Oak Ridge National Laboratories ORNL with Tom Rowan member the Visual and Information Sciences Group While ORNL Scott built the first version Irwin information resource monitoring and display tool part the NII Collaborative Tools project you are interested please examine Scott resume Research The focus Scott research the area information visualization has also done work parallel and distributed computing Below are listed some research areas interest you wish discuss any these topics please get touch with Scott Internet Information Monitoring and Display important area considering the constantly growing and changing nature the Internet Resources such Email Usenet news and the World Wide Web provide continuous flow information While users can access this information using any number readers and browsers difficult determine when and resource needs accessed addition the large amounts information that accumulate can difficult assimilate glance Visualizations are needed that will provide overview these resources with detailed look recent changes result information about the names and content the messages and documents must encoded small number pixels through the use color intensity size and shape These techniques are reflected Irwin tool that monitors resources and provides various alerts when changes occur multi layer view the resources simultaneously provides broad overview all resources plus narrow look recent changes without losing context Recently Scott was also part team that developed SQWID Java tool for visualizing the results from Alta Vista search SQWID provides stress based graph view the search result sites that will hopefully help users identify interesting Web sites Program Visualization examines methods for visualizing information about computer program For years programmers have drawn pictures such flowcharts control flow diagrams help other programmers and users better understand their programs Unfortunately these pictures will not provide the exact desired perspective for every user Clearly methods are needed for automatically generating graphical representations programs Existing code formatters profilers and analysis systems provide adequate static and post mortem views program However debugging and understanding aided the program execution shown conjunction with the program code visually connecting the code and execution the user can identify elements the program that otherwise would not visible Scott working RunView runtime based code analysis system that incorporates these and other ideas also exploring how RunView can used decompose software architectures project with Gregory Abowd Software Visualization the use graphics visualization and animation aid the understanding algorithms architectures and software Software visualizations can constructed using toolkits like Tango and Polka With these toolkits programmer creates objects and programs them with actions that occur over number frames With the advent improved hardware the number frames displayed per second sure decrease Thus natural evolution specify actions not frames but real time seconds and milliseconds This concept central Polka Polka Real Clock evolution the original Polka system with the added capability time based animation activations and durations addition Polka provides more natural ways describe actions and their relationship objects Tech report GIT GVU discusses these ideas detail Wait Free Consensus reflects the ability distributed objects agree the presence failures number object parameters can impact this ability agree See GIT for discussion these parameters and look the properties some distributed objects Teaching Scott has TAed number courses both the graduate and undergraduate levels including Human Computer Interaction Understanding and Constructing Proofs Human Factors Software Development and Theory Automata His position has required that create and grade homeworks and projects assist students maintain Web pages and teach classes occasion Personal his free time Scott plays tennis for ALTA team with its best finishes city runner and division champs also less regularly plays other sports including softball basketball and fencing even took golf recently effort better understand his advisor didn work and Scott sank still further into debt For the past two summers while the Oak Ridge area Scott got ski skurf slalom disk and other water activities since had lake his backyard spends too much time the Web evidenced the size his hotlist Scott tired writing about himself the third person Contact informationD Scott McCrickardCollege Computing Atlantic DriveGeorgia
