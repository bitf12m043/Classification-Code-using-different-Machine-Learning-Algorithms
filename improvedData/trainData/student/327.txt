the College Computing Georgia Tech Notice Graduating Seeking Employment plan graduating with the spring have begun job search and interested position the software industry Seeking company with which can apply technical expertise management knowledge and leadership skills innovative technology and product development environment driven identified expected customer needs RESUME PostScript Academic Background Dean graduated from the University Virginia with degree Electrical Engineering then entered the Computer Science program here Georgia Tech the fall Along the way toward his Dean received his Computer Science Dean has passed his qualifying exams and has proposed thesis topic Visualizing Patterns Interaction the Execution Object Oriented Programs The dynamic behavior object oriented programs difficult design implement and modify Understanding the interactions between classes and objects necessary create efficient designs and make safe modifications This thesis work seeks identify visualize and analyze recurring patterns interaction object oriented program executions means for understanding and examining dynamic behavior Support directed toward design recovery validation and reengineering tasks such comparing existing design mental model specifications with design level specifications reverse engineered from the implementation Dean spent the summer intern the Software Production Research Department formerly Bell Laboratories Naperville and currently doing part time consulting for Scientific Atlanta Inc Dean hopes graduate March and looking forward taking job industry more this academic Research Interests Dean member the software visualization research group Specifically focused visualizing object oriented software His other interests include information visualization object oriented software engineering user interface design and human computer interaction Below are some highlights Dean research Visualizing Object Oriented Software The object oriented approach program design has made significant impact the way software developed and maintained Programmers have adopted the object oriented approach order take advantage better data abstraction and encapsulation reuse through inheritance and polymorphism This work seeks help software developers testers and maintainers understand the dynamics object oriented systems While many design techniques begin with static object modeling the dynamics the object interactions that are most important how program operates course these interactions are the most difficult part the system design and understand Additionally these aspects system are often less documented than their more static counterparts approach use visualization convey information programmers about their systems that not available through static analysis and dynamic profiling The key approach the use patterns interaction between entities the system abstractions which bridge the gulf abstraction between program design and its implementation The first step the process gather static information about system and then generate trace files which record system behavior analyzing the behavior patterns interaction can uncovered Using various filtering and abstraction techniques the high level behavior can extracted from the low level patterns Graphical visualizations are used present this information programmers and allow them control the filtering and abstraction process The abstract behavior can then compared with design level information such execution scenarios dynamic state models architectural models The support thus directed toward design recovery and validation tasks The technical report Visualizing Message Patterns Object Oriented Program Executions describes our initial efforts extract and visualize patterns messages systems History late Dean built the first prototype view for visualizing the execution programs based work done the GROOVE system and contains simple view the inheritance hierarchy and message passing executing program The second generation prototype supports multiple views program and its execution technical report available describing this framework Using

Visualization and Usability Center Georgia Institute Technology Atlanta Technical Report GIT GVU July Visualizing Large Information Spaces Information visualizations must allow users browse information spaces and focus quickly items interest Navigational techniques which utilize some representation the entire information space provide context support more detailed information views However the limited number pixels the screen makes difficult completely display large information spaces The Information Mural two dimensional reduced representation entire information space that fits entirely within display window screen The mural creates miniature version the information space using visual attributes such grayscale shading intensity color and pixel size along with anti aliased compression techniques Information murals can used stand alone visualizations global navigational views This technique evolved from research visualizing the execution large object oriented programs see above Information murals various information including text files stock market data sunspot data river flow data and geographic site locations have been created See the technical report below for
