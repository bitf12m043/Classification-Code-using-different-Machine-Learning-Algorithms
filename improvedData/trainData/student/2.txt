DocumentImage Compression ChipDeveloped Image Compression chip for the VLSI course The chip basically compresses any bit data stream using the LZW compression algorithm This algorithm better suited for images The chip controls external cache CAM content addressable memory where stores patterns from the input stream the hope that the patterns might occur again The chip capable compressing data the rate byte nano seconds There way software routine can compress data that speed Snap the chip Image and Video Transition for RivlProposalPresentation and samples PyraMania DThis game developed for the Software Engineering course Its written and uses Tcl for some the interface and XLib for the rendering You can take look snapshot the game screen PyraMania Parallelomania DCS ResumeHTMLPost Script

currently first semester Computer Science program University Texas Austin Physics and Computer Science Amherst College Research Interests Note intend work with Jenefer Husman risk averse decisions for final project Risk averse decisions were bet you quarter the outcome coin toss you would probably accept the bet were bet you the same coin toss you would probably reject the bet Why people reject fair bets Well there sound economic theory involving maximizing utility and the law diminishing returns that explains this one However this does not explain why people when asked the same question formulated both risk taking and risk preventing manner will respond differently Here example from our beloved Tversky and Kahneman taken almost verbatim from The Framing Decisions and the Psychology Choice Science Imagine that the preparing for the outbreak unusual disease which expected kill people Two alternative programs combat the disease have been proposed Assume that the exact scientific estimate the consequences the programs are follows Problem program adopted people will saved program adopted there probability that people will saved and probability that people will saved Problem program adopted people will die program adopted there probability that nobody will die and probability that people will die Which one the two programs would you favor Analog digital humans brains are made neurons and neurons fire not depending the level electrochemical charge built their axons does that make brain analog biological foundation here shaky the way ahead and scream hypothesis wrong computers transfer information over bus and particular wire has either high low voltage that then interpreted does that make computers analog well Accurate processing with inaccurate outcomes Sometimes simply come with the wrong answer make mistakes subtraction while balancing our checkbook remember invalid telephone number maybe she gave number that wasn her real telephone number But that another story Nevertheless would hard pressed point misfiring neuron account for this error Can correct processing lead incorrect results human cognitive processing sound even complete REMINDER Make
