around you you realize you must have walked much further than you planned there wide variety trees surrounding you all sides but especially oak trees the weather seems fairly overcast but you somehow can figure out going rain snow perhaps will both off the distance you can see large mountain where quite clear that snowing question about you hear birds chirping quite near where you are course they may responding the sounds inside the clearing but the much much louder sounds are coming from nearby waterfall you can see but gotta big you could follow the sound you wanted there seems path leaving that direction there are two other paths leaving the clearing one labeled with sign that says the hill school the other labeled with the sign the hell school there also small wormhole which seems connect nearby house presumably there lot traffic between the two places what inside the clearing inside the clearing are couple structures there shack with door that falling off and completely modern glass house with stones front there pile books scores magazines and random papers scattered all throughout the clearing well seems like there some vague rhyme and reason but glancing the topics there seem few all sorts topics you figure that you look the most recently read books you probably have better idea what makes the person the clearing tick there also resume that you see seems somewhat off the corner presumably has more important things worry about seems kind strange the guy the clearing smiles over you and says hello about and often described being way too thin especially his mother

more obvious that always doing things once starts telling you story but then stops and hums tune then starts telling you why nicholas negroponte moron but you never heard him starts talking you about gay politics late twentieth century america then pauses and starts talking about some obscure theorem from theoretical computer science obvious that rather well read from listening him but tends bit much you start looking his appearance instead wearing mostly two colors purple and dark turquoise everything wearing seems either silk linen and contrasts nicely with his hair has glasses well there gold ring with image beaver his right ring finger the beaver pointing away from him his left ring finger silver ring with ocean wave pattern also wearing pewter pentacle around his neck and looks
