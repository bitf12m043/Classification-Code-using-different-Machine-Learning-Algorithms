GMT Scott Really Basic Home PageScott Really Basic Home Page Okay long overdue slight update pages That doesn mean that they going look all fancy expect very little But least they little more current you interested here some information about Work stuff The University Texas Austin department finished one year and trying not think how many more have The OOPS Group the research group with which working within UTCS Interesting systems and languages research think The class for which the Object Oriented Design The instructor for that class Glenn Downing Amherst College great place spend your undergraduate days While there most time was spent not unpredictably with the Amherst College department The Santa Institute amazing place where spent one summer working different kind research and not only oriented Hobby stuffIt not perfect but Linux invaluable Texas Squash home page The Mead home page Like wine and beer Who doesn Try this stuff Psion Inc Makers very cool palmtop Without would forget own name People stuff Ted Anastasiou You wanted more people check your page Ted Well trying Dan Sharp amazing home page and guy with too much free time Neat stuff Just few miscellaneous items particular order you Austin check out the Austin Dining Guide Actually this page has more than just that information about Austin but think that the most important part Citizen Poke good humor rag from Amherst published PDF Apple Computer They still some things right and IIci lasted forever Alas longer sure that they have very bright future new type machine the BeBox looks like could neat simple page but Better than nothing and hey you probably didn have wait for five minutes for load right you want send email this page maintained sfkaplan utexas edu But before you that you might want

knowledge with declarative semantics domain theory represented algebraic specification domain theory can serve organizational centerpiece domain oriented software development environment providing collection languages for specifying and implementing application programs within the domain along with axioms providing semantics for those languages the application domain itself evolves with the adoption new technologies obsolescence old technologies and extension software artifacts the domain theory must evolve parallel the domain theory does not evolve parallel there risk that the tools which rely the domain theory will become obsolete Because domain theories are mathematical objects may impossible for domain experts evolve the domain theory without significant training knowledge representation and artificial intelligence Such training may not practical Hence knowledge engineers who initially constructed the domain theory consultation with domain experts may become bottleneck the evolution the domain theory The discipline knowledge acquisition has sought provide domain experts with tools which they can evolve domain models distinguished from domain theories not having the requirement for declarative semantics without assistance from knowledge engineers The discipline algebraic specification has sought provide mechanisms structure formal objects manner independent the syntax and semantics the languages used represent those objects Domain Theory Evolution the application algebraic specification research results the problems knowledge acquisition This application has illuminated the space possible ways which domain theories can evolved and consequently shown how existing knowledge acquisition tools address only tiny portions that space Research domain theory evolution seeks establish synergy between the disciplines knowledge acquisition and algebraic specification hoped that this synergy will lead the discover powerful and interesting new tools for knowledge acquisition This work takes place within the context the Amphion Project Publications Arthur Reyes Approach Automatic Generation Domain Theories from Intuitive Semiformal Domain Models
