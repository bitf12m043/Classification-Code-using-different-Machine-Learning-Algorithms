Stanford where spent couple years PhD student work and research Stanford was about streaming live media like audio and video over the internet part this modified IGMP one the multicast protocols developed protocols for multicasting unicasting layered video and developed the Virtual Classroom system The initial prototype was deployed the Spring and Fall quarters and used alternative the Stanford Instructional Television Network SITN program which uses microwave links Students remote sites used the software asynchronously access class lectures and notes over the internet also stumbled upon the fact that other media like text slides etc linked with portions video enhanced its usefulness greatly This lead the formation company Vxtreme Inc Palo Alto Vxtreme new Silicon Valley start develop client sever applications for streaming multimedia delivery over the internet Papers Signalling and Operating System Support for Native Mode ATM Applications Rosen Sharma and Keshav Sigcomm

Image and Video Manipulation Language This language with video and images first class data types allows operators images and sequences like blur speckle transforms like affine dct subband motion estmation also makes manipulation image and video data fast and efficient The implementation writen tcl and currently has been tested SGI machines supports bit and bit display give you flavour what the language looks like set image image imageFrame width height iframe nodisplay file filename image image putImageInCanvas imageFrame image There predecessor this implementation you hate tcl which uses motif and has language interpreter written yacc with limited shell like scripting Here cool shell script that will generate widgets generates all the files given the name the widget The files compile and give you dummy widget event snooper recorder and player consider this one the coolest things ever did does something similar what Spy from Microsoft does for Windows they just released doesnt have scripting language but just replays what recorded with lots kludges fool the server Some Postscript Fractals Creates file called your directory This used hole but postscript viewers fixed dissalowing write calls write Semantics Name Rosen not being Indian name this question was often asked People gave the name their own interpretations Here are some them Some chinese friends makes wonder claim that means small horse not smart hindi native tongue Sharm mean shyness Sharmila means shy And there actress called Sharmila Tagore was nicknamed Sharmila Frozen Sharmila Stupid Horse
