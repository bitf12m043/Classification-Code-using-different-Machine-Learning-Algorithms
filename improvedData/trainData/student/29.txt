Research Project Brief description Compilers program optimization and data dependence testing the presence dynamic pointer based data structures Long description Data structures are important solution components many programs since the proper choice data structure can greatly impact the efficiency the resulting application This well known FORTRAN programmers where arrays serve the primary data structure Recently however given the increasing use languages such Ada and FORTRAN data structures built using pointers and dynamic memory allocation are more prevalent These types structures linked lists trees DAGs present new and difficult analysis and optimization problems for the compiler writer The objective our work solve these problems thereby enabling the parallelization such codes Our approach create data dependence testing framework targeted towards program code involving dynamic pointer based data structures Our framework has three components property collection path collection and dependence testing enable accurate dependence testing the compiler must collect both information about the properties the data structure tree DAG and information about the memory locations being manipulated the data structure The former are represented axioms about the structure the latter paths through the structure Given this information the dependence testing component applies theorem proving general and decidable way determine dependences the code date have implemented prototype our data dependence testing framework and successfully parallelized number important codes involving complex data structures These codes include the body problem Sparse matrices and electromagnetic simulation based Bipartite graphs Speedups were linear near linear shared memory multiprocessor Our work crucial optimizing and parallelizing compilers since dependence information directly impacts the application numerous performance enhancing transformations The more accurate the dependence information the more chances for optimization and parallelization all levels from low level instruction scheduling source level loop transformations Our work represents the first accurate and general
