Science Boston University working collaborative editing more interested text and hypertext than multimedia and hypermedia and most interested how people can collaborate using and editing shared hypertexts practical side interested multi user collaboration shared documents real networks that say unreliable regularly disconnected networks The experience writing book with author has added first hand depth what were originally theoretically motivated beliefs radical side inspired great degree Ted Nelson interested shared writing spaces where free writing and writing evrything can take place with careful trail what has happened insurance against misrepresentation Fortunately for both sides professional personality the same kind technology required solve both problems Real time collaboration something that think very important but not one current areas activity also SGML least content markup bigot This page contains descriptions work versioning and markup You have find some other way scope out hobbies and favorite links David researchVersioningI working model call Palimpsest after the overwritten scroll from which scholars extract previous versions texts Palimpsest general data model that provides very fine level control version management states and policies makes explicit architectural assumption that version management system controlling data and not processes for accessing data This approach allows finer control the cost greater application overhead The Palimpsest paper was presented the Workshop Collaborative Editing Systems CSCW the most date documentation most general work version control done partial HTML conversion this paper This converted version complete except that still missing the first illustrations you prefer fully formatted version download the file the end this link get compressed postscript the Palimpsest paper Fabio Vitali and have written paper proposing system version management for the World Wide Web This designed relatively easy implement method bring artifact based collaboration the WWW supporting independent editing via version control over the Web The recent announcement widespread availability Java based Web browsers makes implementation cross platform client side editors seem much more feasible This paper will was presented the Fourth World Wide Web Conference December recently written little screed versioning and the WWW for the Versioning Working group run Jim Whitehead the University California With Fabio Vitali and the others the group been working draft functional requirements for versioning the web MarkupContent markup technique for describing texts for future processing The current baseline for all content markup systems SGML ISO standard However there are many questions about markup that are unanswered and perhaps unanswerable for instance for all the talk SGML being semantically based there good description what means mark document There are also interesting problems with handling non hierarchical markup SGML well good arguments that non hierarchical structures are important texts been following the work non hierarchical markup with Elli Mylonas and Steven DeRose paper abstract accepted the ACH ALLC annual conference Bergen This abstract describes some advanced directions for describing the structure the kinds complex texts and textual theories that come humanistic research The Text Encoding Initiative has variety lessons offer the HTML effort paper appear the Fourth WWW conference four fellow TEI alumni and offer some Lessons for the World Wide Web from the Text Encoding Initiative Versioning Working GroupThe Versioning Working Group group currently four people who are all concerned with the problems version management hypertext systems Currently are working paper sort union framework the strategies for version and change management which are aware held workshop ECHT which hope will help expand and solidify the hypertext version management community Recently held another workshop ECSCW whose proceeedings are not yet available Another interesting workshop was the Workshop Collaborative Editing Systems held CSCW HyTimeSteven DeRose and have written book the HyTime standard which describes SGML based hypermedia interchange language More Making Hypermedia Work User Guide HyTime HyTime ongoing reviewSteven DeRose and have also prepared some input the ongoing HyTime review process technical Corrigendum has been accepted ballot but The final wording the upcoming changes has not yet been determined Steve and have had number discussions changes that might made and prepared document discussing our proposed changes Most changes proposed this document have been accepted principle some things have been changed but different way from what suggested few were rejected Our annex comments mostly and some others deferred for more careful consideration This daughter Despina Last updated
