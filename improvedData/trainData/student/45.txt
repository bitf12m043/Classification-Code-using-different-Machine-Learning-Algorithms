regularly any longer but you are interested giving try let know still enjoy going from time time Jump out airplanes only done this twice but totally hooked soon scrape the time and money going again Anyone interested joining can get you off Hurtle down mountainsides Skiing recent hobby for Once discovered the homomorphism that mapped childhood sport ice hockey skiing was off just imagine playing ice hockey with really long skates inclined surface everything else the same especially you get way Ride bike wife and are working our first century mile trip from Newport Beach San Diego Read favorite authors are Toni Morrison especially her books Song Soloman and Beloved and Don DeLillo especially The Names and Ratner Star Dabble foreign languages Right now just try acquire whatever limited foreign language abilities ever had Languages that forget more and more daily basis are Hebrew can still speak read and write but not very well Spanish can speak write but for some strange reason can understand lot and Japanese just nod knowingly Web links Some other researchers programming languages and compilers Computing Research Association Glimpse bibliographic search engine with
