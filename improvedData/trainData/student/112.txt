parallel computers consisting very simple processors connected dimensional mesh The guiding vision this work time perhaps years hence which materials science has taken the place computer architecture and computers are crystals with each processor molecule the lattice Long before this goal can realized can and should prepare for the ubiquitous parallelism will offer Our algorithms must heed the laws physics and pay attention chip designers now spatial layout and the currently hidden cost communication This can accomplished designing our algorithms for mesh pursue this vision requires both theoretical and practical work far work could characterized feasibility study have produced cellular architecture which could efficiently realized with current hardware simulator for this architecture algorithms programs and operating system design for general purpose computing believe that general purpose computers not problems like protein structure are the grand challenge parallel architecture Parallel computational power will not really succeed until becomes commodity and sold for desktop machines video games Directions for future research include VLSI implementation this architecture and the design programming language Most widely used languages hide the details the machine instruction set but reflect the underlying Von Neumann architecture believe that this connection the architecture has been good thing for algorithm design and really exploit parallel machines need language for which the costs operations are easy estimate they are for Von Neumann machine Publications
