Kenneth Birman and Robbert van Renesse minor field mathematics concentrating statistics Research Interests Engineering layered communication protocols Weak consistency Performance HTML Java Engineering layered communication protocols research interests include the problems specifying implementing and verifying applications run distributed computer systems dissertation work has concentrated the formal specification and verification the properties Horus protocol layers Using the Temporal Logic Actions one can specify various interesting fundamental properties the protocol layers used Horus protocol stacks furthermore one can write formula the assume guarantee style for each layer specifying the properties might provide its interfaces depending the properties the layers above and below the stack One can then employ straightforward techniques verify that given stack provides certain desired properties the top the stack under specified conditions even for unusual combinations layers layers stacked atypical stacking order Ultimately users Horus and other layered communications systems should able call these verification techniques help construct customized stacks that omit unnecessary layers avoiding their associated costs with the confidence that the included layers and their stacking order are sufficient provide the desired guarantees This work intended part the basis for the Securing and Hardening Horus project have developed Java applet that gives rough demonstration proposed method verifying the properties Horus protocol stacks initial interest the Horus project stems from the promise the Horus protocol suite provide various guarantees consistency programmers message passing environments where hosts may crash and messages may delayed lost software development engineer who has worked distributed applications whose components were prone failure feel the features Horus offer considerable promise application developers Weak consistency While Cornell have become interested the problems distribution computing over wide area networks and have looked into the problems revision control files wide area environment and general distributed environment whose network prone partitioned into disconnected portions More generally interested notions weak consistency that would allow multiple temporarily disconnected sites make progress concurrently Performance research Cornell has concentrated correctness protocols but other measures such high availability low response time and efficient use resources are clearly equally important large part the problem the apparently randomized timing system loads and activity distributed applications with the notable exception those that run dedicated parallel machines This behavior also should susceptible some mathematical analysis though different kind which encouraged interest statistics HTML and Java The World Wide Web itself interesting distributed application with many possibilities explore experimented with simple ways use hypertext navigate information most these appear Web site about LEGO toys and been hacking Java applets executable code that Netscape browser can download and run for example birthday puzzle calculator and tool for verifying properties Horus protocol stacks Professional Affiliations member IEEE ACM and MAA Other Information See WWW links
