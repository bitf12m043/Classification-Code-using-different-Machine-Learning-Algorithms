start Here goes Once upon time long long ago actually November land they call Bharat India for the outside world precise was born cute chubby little baby weighing approximately four pounds took the name Deepak meaning light and went actually still the process change the world Incidentally probably out divine interference Aishwarya Rai Miss World was born the same day Isn she lucky born the same day Leaving out the miniscule details earlier life let dive straight into high school Well lucky have been National Public School Bangalore for greater part schooling Now that the place for someone And college Nothings better than KREC Thats where majored Computer Science wonder how long will before get another four year holiday have been part the all conquering Class was joy never matched And here Cornell University pursuing masters degree Computer Science Well just hope gets somewhere And finally heres link friends AshishAastha IndiraAnkitVineet Back the main page MIME Version Server CERN

its original point font two column style required ICSE entitled The Uncertainty Principle Software Engineering get the latest version the paper click Here Links earlier versions this paper can also found the collection papers Workflow and Process Automation Professional Interests know few things about software engineering software process modeling and object oriented analysis and design also interested Bayesian networks and uncertainty modeling Object Oriented Techniques familiar with leading methods for analysis and design including the latest work the Unified Modeling Language UML and the OPEN MOSES effort fact member the OPEN Consortium For information UML see Rational Object Technology web page good source information CASE Tools the Web can found Here addition collection more than links about object orientation available Cetus Heidelberg Germany with mirror sites Chicago Illinois and Provo Utah Bayesian Networks interested Bayesian networks There are few quality pages this topic including AFIT LaboratoryLonnie Chrisman Roadmap Bayesian Research Also you can find Bayesian Network Editor implemented Java the Bayesian Editor pageOther Interests Besides profesional
