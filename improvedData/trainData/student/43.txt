Phone Research Broadly speaking primary research interests are type theory and the design implementation and semantics programming languages recent emphasis has been the areas subtyping object oriented programming and modularity implementing practical programming language KML which combines these features functional programming language and formulating for type theoretic semantics interesting view programming languages tractable approximation the intractably rich world foundational type theories which the whole mathematics can performed New programming language developments often result from mapping type theoretic constructions through approximation into programming language setting and conversely new paradigms programming languages are often not well understood until they have been formulated type theoretically interested deepening our understanding this relationship between type theory and programming languages particularly the issues tractability and approximation and how they can mitigated also interested model compilation that views series translations into lower intermediate calculi where each intermediate calculus can embedded into type theory and the corresponding interpretation program invariant under each translation Such model allows relate each stage compilation original type theoretic semantics which allows the use standard compilation techniques and optimizations while guaranteeing safety and correctness Also careful formulation such intermediate calculi make possible additional optimizations that are unavailable other compilation strategies work forms part the Nuprl project here Cornell The project name comes from the Nuprl system formal mathematics and logic type theory based the type theories Martin MIME Version

focus the ways which organizations use online information resources pilot research suggests that resources may play important role the formation and maintenance interorganizational relationships The main objective current research analyze how interorganizational relationships are mediated through resource use case study will describe the social processes online information mediation identifying the roles intermediaries and the patterns mediation which occur when resources and other resources such paper based media and personal contacts are used intensively organizations the corporate sector
