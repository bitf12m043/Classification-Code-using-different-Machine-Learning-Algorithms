comment form just send mail finger account see current plan and whether the system Gainful employment for Introduction Artificial Intelligence Current Project computers are smart why have understand them Making machines more intelligent the goal Artificial Intelligence the essence intelligence the ability learn and adapt learn act appropriately order reach our goals Reinforcement learning treats this problem the general case where the system has outputs control actions that can change its environment and has inputs through which senses its environment also has input for reinforcement which weak kind feedback which can expressed positive negative number instead having teacher present the system with input output pairs the system instead receives thumbs thumbs down irregular intervals work has focussed how the need distinguish good actions from bad ones can direct the process building good representation the environment terms relevant important features See note importance based feature extraction Currently applying this notion importance the problem learning balance the need explore the world with the need perform optimally exploration exploitation also investigating ways using importance make the learning process more efficient allowing the system specify the starting points for its learning experiments active learning goal develop better understanding intelligent adaptation hope that this will provide basis for intelligent action which will also benefit from knowledge based and task based work See really out date sorry reinforcement learning page for more
