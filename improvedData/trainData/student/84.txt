under the supervision Robert Constable Here summary current status interests include the theory and practice programming languages There great resource CMU under The Fox Project Home Page especially Mark Leone resources for programming language research own work programming languages mainly software verification One the tools use for specification type theory use the formal system Nuprl developed here the Cornell University Department Computer Science research make use higher level modules and abstract data types and relate them type theory Here are some recent papers Some papers have published CornellA bibliography some papers published Bellcore also have some slides talks have given the Nuprl seminar The slides can pretty technical but they give overview the work done Cornell you want see more about try sequence identification Some interests have include The Fine Arts Here gallery mine There are lot other resources for fine arts the Web Try The Art Net Web The FineArt Forum
