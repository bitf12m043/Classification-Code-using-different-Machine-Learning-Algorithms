Texas Austin Research Sequential decision tasks appear many practical real world problems including control resource allocation and routing Such tasks can characterized the following scenario agent observes state dynamic system and selects from finite set actions The system then enters new state upon which the agent must select another action The system may return payoff for each decision made for sequence decisions The objective select the sequence actions that return the highest total cumulative payoff research evolve Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithms learn and perform sequential decision tasks particularly interested tasks where problem specific knowledge currently unavailable costly obtain Some domains that have studied include game playing intelligent control and constraint
