when David Bau and were teaching you might have guessed graduate student the department Computer Science Cornell University work with Prof Keshav Pingali research interests are Compilers for High Performance Architectures particular working the parallelization sparse matrix codes This work part the Bernoulli project Other members group are Paul Stodghill and Indu KodukulaPublications Here what Henry Kissinger has once said about lawyers and professors friends the legal profession like remind comment British judge the difference between lawyers and professors very simple said Lord Denning The function lawyers find solution every difficulty presented them whereas the function the professors find difficulty with every solution Today the number difficulties seems outpacing the number solutions either because lawyer friends are not working hard enough because there are too many professors the government Support privacy the net through strong encryption MIME Version Server CERN Date

science His research interests are the architecture and performance analysis data traffic over ATM networks has been with the Network Research Group led Prof Tatsuya Suda since has published number papers connectionless servers for ATM and ATM congestion control EDUCATION Currently pursuing Information and Computer Science the University California Irvine Thesis work progressing two stages The first stage design connectionless server for transmitting connectionless datagrams over the connection oriented Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM network and performance analysis through simulations and analysis nearly complete having resulted paper currently submission The second stage exploration the potential fractal nature ATM traffic currently progress Completion expected Information and Computer Science University California Irvine June Investigated Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks and congestion control techniques Computer Engineering University California San Diego June Courses were distributed among the software oriented computer science and the hardware oriented electrical engineering fields EXPERIENCE Jul present Performance analyst investigating the architecture and performance multimedia systems Feb Mar Technical intern responsible assisting performance analysis and software development for transaction processing systems Unix environment More detail work

Southwest Asia Campaign Ribbon Good Conduct Medal Saudi Arabia Service Medal Naval and Marine Corps Airborne Medal Marksman Medal WORK PROGRESS The following brief synopsis work progress Data over ATM Packet loss probability multiplexer being investigated with several packet level cell discarding schemes The discarding schemes drop useless cells from packet that has already suffered cell loss ATM Connectionless Service Most work ATM connectionless service being summarized into paper submitted later date ATM Traffic Characteristics and Self Similarity Efficient methods evaluate the performance self similar traffic being investigated currently not have any papers submission but this one preparation for one Duke Hong and Tatsuya Suda investigation connectionless servers for data transport
