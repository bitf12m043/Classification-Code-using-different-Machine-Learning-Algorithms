doing here graduate student Computer Science Cornell University hoping complete PhD the turn the century When not listening rock music goofing off work the Cornell ATM Cluster Project with advisor Thorsten von Eicken What Anindya thinks cool Like most other graduate students from India who went the Indian Institute Technology Kanpur die hard Pink Floyd fanatic and finally realized childhood dream seeing them perform live last summer Philadelphia The other love with Plum who known the great unwashed Pelham Grenville Wodehouse And yes also attended Woodstock For the truly motivated here online Woodstock review with photographs Woodstock where experienced Metallica live for the first time would have loved see the soccer worldcup last year but unfortunately did not happen like cook and have tried put some recipes that like online also fancy myself connoisseur good whisky especially single malts Links some more cool stuff The Calvin and Hobbes Archive South Asian Writers Cheers Monty Python Beavis and ButtheadOther Useful Stuff The CUINFO gopher And now for something completely different working the Cornell ATM Cluster Project which aims providing high performance communications layer clusters workstations such that parallel program performance comparable state the art MPPs can acheived such clusters have developed very fast message passing layer called Net and implementation Active Messages and Split Net that show performance par with parallel programs running the and the Meiko addition TCP UDP implemented Net shows really low latencies and can saturate the fibre low segment sizes are also working collaboration with the Berkeley NoW project team develop specification for communications layer that would enable fast communication between processes both trusted and untrusted environments Publications Active Messages and Net Active Messages Mechanism for Integrated Communication and Computation Thorsten von Eicken David Culler Seth Goldstein and Klaus Schauser

Although perhaps because quit first real job quickly defunct startup company called Enfoprise building business workstations the first day because they had changed job assignment from UNIX driver writing Systems Integration have had longstanding love hate relationship with configuration management tools like SCCS and RCS first published paper was Boxes Links and Parallel Trees Elements Configuration Management System the first USEnix Workshop Software Management this described centralized RCS database with multiple views and hardlink cloning save space and time used Gould Computer Systems Division UNIX team Brian Berliner deprecates approach one the CVS papers mainly because advocates optimistic concurrency control approach whereas thought that advocated locking Actually advocate optimistic concurrency control but also advocate locking case the optimistic version gets into livelock and usually insist that there single identified serial schedule source code checkins that testing can proceed linear manner require programmers test that their new code works system with all previous fixes applied Although recognize that even this requirement can relaxed often use more stripped down version the same approach things like the EAS apologize for never having created truly portable set tools accomplish this uses similar approach although Mike Fetterman and Mark Aitken deserve the credit here For enhanced RCS with several features that went into RCS most notably the version number which became RCS And overall sufficiently fan RCS that RCS everything including cshrc login and even web page Calendar Wisconsin How arrange meetings with etc Since there seems ubiquitous calendaring scheduling program the university Wisconsin Department various people use SUN cmtool the public domain ical plan but there not critical mass any these now doing calendaring isolation using the Pilot PDA and its associated software least this means can add meetings the fly When gets into Pilot the meeting committed least committed possible may also record meetings the fly using Voice Organizer Therefore arrange meeting with you must get touch with preferably email possibly phone person that can manually add the meeting calendar have not yet created way download calendar from the Pilot software web page have not yet created way download calendar from the Pilot software Microsoft watch Intel Intel was devout user the group scheduling program last time was Intel Synchronize UNIX but also OnTime the past which were weak that they did not have disconnected operation email operation but least allowed the majority people and MRL schedule meetings with without manual intervention Intel the scheduling algorithm was you have access Andy calendar using Synchronize use but also tell Andy what the meeting about email person reserve the right not meetings which have been blindly invited you cannot use Synchronize urgent make the meeting with Andy admin Teresa Locke who can put Synchronize possible check out Andy calendar his web page and propose the meeting not urgent two more weeks the future you can avoid bothering Teresa sending Andy email but realize that Andy may miss the meeting you have not sent the email far enough advance Overall Scheduling and calendaring and other PIM and PDA like topics are something that fascinated with How bring the efficiency advantages having personal secretaries and aides camp all computer users Header afs wisc edu glew public html RCS glew html glew Exp
