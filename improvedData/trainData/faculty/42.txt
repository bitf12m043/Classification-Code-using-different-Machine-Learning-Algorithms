relationships between geometry and physical phenomena that mechanical artifacts can modeled represented analyzed manipulated designed and manufactured based computer representations and algorithms Some specific ongoing projects include Geometric Modeling Ability create convert between and maintain consistency distinct representations mechanical parts major technological barrier that undermines the usefulness and reliability commercial geometric modeling systems Current research efforts focus eliminating ambiguity communicating engineering specifications formal modeling parametric families mechanical parts and investigating novel methods and computational techniques support design and manufacturing Mechanical Design Today mechanical forms functions and fabrication processes cannot described combinatorially terms discrete simple and interacting primitives this apparent lack combinatorial structure major roadblock for competitive design and manufacturing mechanical systems collaboration with industry the present research deals with theoretical practical and computational aspects mechanical design and seeks establish formal basis for making mechanical design and manufacturing parts more systematic and competitive and for smooth integration mechanical form modeling with other engineering activities Physical Modeling Geometric models contain only part the information needed capture the desired physical behavior artifact and the processes used manufacture Recent study algebraic topological models called chain models physical behavior suggests that may possible unify physical and geometric modeling and thus facilitate development new computer aided engineering tools Current investigations use these and other models physical behavior develop new engineering languages and computer algorithms for systematic specification modeling simulation and analysis physical objects and systems COE Depts Centers Consortia Services Fountain Index Search Mail
