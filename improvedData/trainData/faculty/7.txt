research interests lie two main areas database system performance and next generation database systems the performance area topics current interest include performance tradeoffs and techniques for object oriented database systems design and evaluation algorithms related transaction processing and scheduling complex multi user database workloads based user specified performance goals the next generation database system area have been involved the EXODUS extensible DBMS project now involved SHORE project aimed developing scalable repository for the storage and sharing persistent objects heterogeneous environment The goal the SHORE effort which building upon experience from the EXODUS project meet the object management needs and replace the use Unix files applications such CAD CAM and CASE Most recently have moved from academia industry After twelve great years part what become the best academic database systems research group the known universe the time has come for tackle some new and different challenges now working the IBM Almaden Research Center the source number the papers that been teaching students for the past twelve years IBM work will related objects and databases with significant fraction time being spent relatively new project there called Garlic Garlic effort build heterogeneous multimedia information system that allows data living variety repositories queried and manipulated though resided one homogeneous object database spent sabbatical IBM working Garlic continued work Madison focusing with graduate student query browser front end tool called
