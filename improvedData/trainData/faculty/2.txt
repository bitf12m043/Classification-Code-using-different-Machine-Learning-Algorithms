Interests research goal make video first class data type our computing environment this end research group Project Zeno building technologies supporting the storage communication and processing continuous media data contrast other commercial and research approaches which require specialized hardware operating systems networks usable all these technologies are designing fit into the current research environment Our premise that the current hardware software and communication infrastructure sufficient support research into continuous media systems and applications are verifying this hypothesis building working systems Our research storage systems directed towards building the Zeno distributed video file server The Zeno architecture uses network workstations connected generic local area network ethernet common environment computing research laboratories Each workstation can act simultaneously both client and server continuous media data client workstation plays video stored one more servers server workstation file server for video data Each client can receive video stored several servers and each server can service several clients Compared with large centralized servers the advantages this design are Scalability new clients are added new servers are automatically added Load balancing The load generated serving videos distributed both across machines and across networks the case where the servers are located different networks Low initial investment utilizing existing infrastructure the Zeno architecture promotes early adoption research environments with almost initial investment Our research communication systems centered around best effort delivery protocols Such protocols are built existing network protocols and contrast many other research efforts not need reserve network resources establish connection Resource reservation protocols are well suited the national communication infrastructure where users can charged per call basis for bandwidth and connections but are poorly suited network environments where the network shared resource equally accessible all researchers Our approach appropriate for the latter environments commonly found research laboratories The communication protocol have developed called Cyclic UDP built top the UDP datagram protocol and designed transport audio and video data playback applications local metropolitan and wide area networks Cyclic UDP used the Zeno file server deliver audio and video data clients paper describing cyclic UDP available online well the slides from research talk Our research processing video data has been two fold First are developing algorithms process video data the compressed representation Processing video without decompression leads dramatic speed ups processing performance since both removes the time consuming processes compression and decompression and reduces the amount data that must processed Experiments with implementation these ideas JPEG compressed image data indicates that the data can processed one two orders magnitude faster than what was possible with previous approaches are currently extending these ideas parallelizing the algorithms using networks workstations and developing method for transcoding video software video transcoding video translated from one compression format another useful operation for video file servers that must service heterogeneous clients paper describing compressed domain processing available online Our research video processing also exploring methods simplify experimentation with video processing developing programming language where video first class data type This language called Rivl pronounced rival allows video processing effects specified independent the resolution and format the source material The language does for video what Postscript did for text and graphics provides resolution independent method for specifying video processing Thus the same program can process low quality QuickTime video very quickly while editing decisions are made and then used format high quality finished product off line much the same way that Postscript can previewed workstation low quality then sent dpi printer for camera ready copy paper describing RVL available online talk that reviews our research video processing both compressed domain processing and Rivl available online The common theme all these efforts provide tools make video usable our research environment talk that reviews this research also available online Teaching Cornell University teach undergraduate course
