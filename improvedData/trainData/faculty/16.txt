programing set theory topology Research Summary Most research work involves logic and its applications Typical applications are automated deduction and logic programming automated deduction use tools like resolution prove new mathematical theorems logic programming study the semantics languages like Prolog Specific topics considering are the Prolog use negation failure and the semantic incompatibilities between least fixed point computations and the Prolog style backtracking computation mathematical logic work axiomatic set theory Besides being interest its own right this subject relates various abstract areas mathematics such set theoretic topology and measure theory where many basic questions turn out independent the usual axioms set theory Selected Recent Publications The
