Mathematics Computer Sciences Department University Wisconsin Dayton Madison telephone fax email joseph wisc edu Purdue University Interests Structural and applied complexity theory computational biology computational geometry mathematical logic Research Summary research concerns two areas theoretical computer science the study structural properties complexity classes and the design and analysis algorithms for biological problems the last twenty years great deal work has gone into studying the properties sets that are decidable deterministic and nondeterministic polynomial time Despite this effort still know very little about these classes Recently fact some computer scientists have questioned the adequacy known proof techniques for resolving questions such whether research investigates the structural properties sets these classes and explores formal way the types proof techniques necessary resolve problems concerning complexity classes research interests computational biology are primarily the area computational methods for genome sequencing These included the development dynamic data structures and algorithms for fragment assembly large scale genome sequencing projects and the development specific algorithmic techniques for handling repetitive sequences addition research has utilized graph theoretic methods for doing rapid homology detection the analysis
