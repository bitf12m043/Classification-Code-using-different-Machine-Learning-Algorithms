Madras Teaching Activities Course text Database Management Systems Software for educational use Minibase and Coral The text Database Management Systems published McGraw Hill aimed first and second courses database systems the undergraduate and graduate levels The Minibase relational DBMS was developed conjunction with this text The Coral system also used courses that deal with logic databases several schools Research Interests Integrating heterogeneous data sources Content based querying and indexing sequence and image data Exploratory analysis large data sets data mining Extending database query languages using constraints and deduction the use databases grows and diversifies increasingly important able access data from dispersed heterogeneous independently developed sources easily the RODIN project and its successor the project investigating several issues formal techniques and practical toolkits for semantic integration supporting multiple levels service and access database and database access networked cluster machines This joint work with Profs Ioannidis and Livny recent work the results visual data exploration from the NEXT project which joint work with Prof Livny are being applied data integration and querying over the Web second area interest content based querying complex data such sequences and image sets The SEQ system deals with queries over sequence data and focuses DBMS design and optimization issues related sequence data part the NEXT project and joint work with Prof Livny important aspect this work its use for identifying trends the data general identifying useful patterns information the PIQ project the goal support content based retrieval from large sets images Our focus developing and implementing expressive data definition language that can used customize general image database system take advantage specialized information about given collection images that indexed and queried interest querying and analysis data covers data exploration and mining have developed powerful clustering algorithm called BIRCH for large datasets and visual data exploration tool called DEVise part the NEXT project long standing research interest the extension relational database query languages with logic programming features such structured terms and recursion and the use arithmetic constraints specify data and queries more compactly and efficiently ongoing project involves the continued development and use the CORAL deductive system The evaluation based upon bottom fixpoint evaluation techniques and several optimizations are applied make efficient across broad range programs Research Projects CORAL NEXT PIQ Graduates Sudarshan August Run Time Optimizations Bottom Evaluation Logic Programs First
