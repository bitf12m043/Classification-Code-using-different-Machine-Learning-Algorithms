visualization complex query optimization heterogeneous databases research primarily focuses two areas database systems optimization complex queries and database support for scientific data Future database applications pose several new challenges query optimization The complexity queries asked will significantly higher than traditional systems The number alternative evaluation algorithms will much higher well especially with the use parallelism with attempts optimize for several values run time parameters parametric query optimization Thus the number alternative access plan for processing query will extremely large that the currently used algorithms for finding the optimum among them will inadequate research investigates the use randomized optimization algorithms viable solution this problem primarily interested simulated annealing and genetic algorithms well other alternatives that take advantage special properties query optimization also looking into complex query scheduling problems especially those that arise parallel and multimedia environments Error propagation size and cost estimates complex queries are also part studies where trying identify the appropriate information that must maintained database system limit the propagation error that end primarily focusing identifying the properties optimal histograms that approximate the distribution values relation attributes The computational mode investigation expected part many experiments various scientific disciplines the future The databases generated need specialized support many aspects that current technology not ready provide involved the development the ZOO Desktop Experiment Management Environment that will help scientists throughout the life cycle their experimental studies primary component that system will database system Two major issues that work addresses are visual user interfaces and semantic heterogeneity the former concentrating identifying what the right metaphors are for representing complex database schemas queries and objects scientists that they are natural them and also investigating the power dynamic visual queries the latter concentrating developing visual tools that will facilitate translation and integration different data formats schemas Although these issues are generic and arise all experimental scientific disciplines efforts are guided the needs specific projects with which associated particular simulation based performance studies computer systems simulation based modeling plant growth NMR spectroscopy DNA sequencing and microscopic imaging
