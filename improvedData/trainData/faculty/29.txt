Institute Technology The strategic goal our research contribute the development comprehensive theory computational complexity Computational complexity the study the quantitative laws that govern computation and essential part the science base needed guide harness and exploit the explosively growing computer technology Computational complexity classifies problems the amounts various computational resources needed solve them This classification yields complexity classes each which consists all problems that can solved within given computational resource bound gain deeper understanding what makes problems hard compute explore various complexity classes relations between these classes and the internal structure these classes also study the trade offs between different computational resources problem solving with particular attention sequential time parallel time nondeterministic time memory requirements randomness computational resource and interactive computing

and operating systems Research Summary interested analytic modeling techniques and their application computer system performance issues with emphasis parallel and distributed system design issues The modeling techniques have developed together with graduate students and colleagues include the Generalized Timed Petri Net and customized mean value analysis The GTPN can represent parallel system features such synchronization and priority service precisely The customized MVA technique yields set intuitive equations that represent parallel system features more approximately but can solved more efficiently have also recently proposed the use technique called interpolation approximations for analysis parallel processor allocation policies This technique may also have broader applicability for parallel systems performance analysis Current research projects include characterization for high performance parallel workloads analysis parallel processor scheduling policies scheduling issues
