understanding concurrent programs are becoming increasingly important distributed computing systems become widespread mission critical applications research has focused the development these techniques have been heavily involved applying assertional reasoning the design concurrent distributed fault tolerant and real time programs completing textbook this subject Along with David Gries continue investigations concerning our first order equational logic This past year streamlined the inference rules and evaluated number techniques for handling undefined terms and partial functions Thomas Bressoud and completed building and analyzing our hypervisor based implementation replication management for RISC architecture Our protocols ensure that the sequence instructions executed two virtual machines running different physical processors are identical The protocols also coordinate issued these virtual machines Use hypervisor implement replica coordination attractive least theory When replica coordination implemented hypervisor instantly becomes available all hardware realizations the given instruction set architecture including realizations that did not exist when the hypervisor was written Second when replica coordination implemented hypervisor single implementation suffices for every operating system that executes that instruction set architecture Finally implementing replica coordination hypervisor the applications programmer freed from this task Jointly with Dag Johansen University MIME Version Server CERN Date Tuesday Jan GMT Content Type text html

Linear and nonlinear network optimization parallel algorithms for large scale optimization Research Summary Most large scale optimization problems exhibit substructures that make possible solutions via algorithms with high degree parallelism Such substructures include quasi independent blocks constraints for different commodities time periods scenarios and geographically disjoint components approximating solutions the case network optimization decomposition into approximating linear network subproblems particularly attractive because the corresponding very fast solution techniques The emphases research have been the development new parallel optimization algorithms that utilize these features and techniques such genetic algorithms take advantage distributed computing environments
