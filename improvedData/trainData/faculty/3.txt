Wisconsin Madison Research are engaged the study computer systems that provide mechanical assistance problem solving especially programming and mathematics This involves long term study ways make the formalization mathematics feasible and useful have implemented three such systems the past tne years PRL and Nuprl Our major experimentation with Nuprl line Lisp program that implements constructive theory types Systems such Nuprl are useful formalizations mathematics because they can express wide variety proof and program building methods metalevel programs the system These provide considerable theorem proving power Moreover Nuprl especially useful because can evaluate the computational content theorems principle Nuprl both fomal system mathematics and programming language continue improve Nuprl the current version used Cornell called Nuprl differs from its predecessors having new term editor designed Stuart Allen and implemented Richard Eaton Its internal structure more modular making the system suitable for definition wide variety logics beyond the built constructive type theory Also the entire theorem proving mechanism has been rebuilt and stream lined Paul Jackson building the work Douglas Howe This contributes the generic nature Nuprl Finally this version the system can refer itself There internal description the language and its logic built principally William Aitken using the theory developed Allen Howe and myself Richard Eaton designed link between the internal description the logic and the logic itself which makes possible prove theorems about the process proving theorems are also engaged three exciting joint ventures One with Miriam Leeser Electrical ENgineering and the other two are Computer Science with David Gries Polya and with Richard Zippel Weyl With Lesser are involved hardware synthesis and verification Leeser and her student Mark Aagard have used Nuprl prove the correctness line boolean circuit minimization package Pbs used circuit designers This component Leeser Bedroc system implements the weak division algorithm which widely used circuit design systems This major theorem proving effort taught great deal about the effectiveness our technology the hands expert users from application domain The second joint venture involves building model the Polya programming language and program refinement mechanism for both designed David Gries which will enable him write his handbook algorithms the manner that devised through years study the programming process Stuart Allen has givne formal type theoretic definition Polya expect experimenting soon with transforms and trying capture the programming style that Gries wants have recently begun collaboration that hope relate the Polya effort Conal Mannion has been exploring the possibility using Nuprl computational science have been discussing problems with Richard Zippel and are hoping connect Zippel symbolic algebra system Weyl with Nuprl the near future This will used explore the development scientific computing software using Weyl and Nuprl together with other tools that Zippel building Professional ActivitiesEditor Journal Symbolic ComputationEditor

Theoretical computer science computational number theory algebraic algorithms complexity theory cryptography six string automata Research Summary interested how one uses computers efficiently solve algebraic and number theoretic problems example how does one tell digit number prime without examining all possible factors These problems have intrinsic mathematical interest well applications random number generation codes for reliable and secure information transmission computer algebra and other areas also interested applying probability theory the design and analysis algorithms For example large number composite can proved simple test that uses auxiliary number called witness practice one usually finds witness direct search among the small primes This leads the following natural question How large the least witness function the number tested recent work have given accurate heuristic model based probabilistic assumptions that allows this and similar questions answered Recent
