particular investigating two techniques improve file system performance application specific replacement policies for the file cache and aggressive prefetching file data from the disk have developed system which the kernel allocates physical pages individual applications and each application responsible for deciding how use its physical pages for caching and prefetching The system uses fair global allocation policy the kernel and carefully integrates cache replacement prefetching and disk scheduling prototype implementation uniprocessor systems has demonstrated that good application chosen replacement strategies and prefetching information can significantly improve the performance many applications Currently extending these techniques parallel systems developing integrated caching and prefetching algorithms for parallel disk arrays addition investigating the global resource management problems operating systems Last modified Wed Apr Pei Cao cao wisc edu
