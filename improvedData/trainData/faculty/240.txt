science option from the College William and Mary and the and degrees computer science from Cornell University and respectively Since Rick has been the Department Computer Science The University Arizona where currently holds the rank Professor His research interests include distributed systems fault tolerant computing and heterogeneous scientific applications the latter area heads the Schooner Project whose goal provide software support for constructing scientific meta computations across networks heterogeneous machines Much his current work fault tolerant computing involves using the kernel various ways support fault tolerance and done cooperation with members the Network Systems Research Group currently supervises one postdoctoral associate Matti Hiltunen and four graduate students Nina Bhatti Ilwoo Chang Xiaonan Han and Don Waugaman Rick also active promoting increased interaction between and Japanese computer scientists spent seven months visiting the Katayama Laboratory Tokyo Institute Technology where worked using attribute grammar formalism implement fault tolerant software currently spending year Hitachi Central Research Laboratory near Tokyo working various software issues related heterogeneous scientific computation Both these visits have been supported the NSF Japan Cooperative Science Program Rick member ACM IEEE and the IFIP Working Group Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance the editorial boards IEEE Transactions Computers IEEE Parallel and Distributed Technology and the Springer Verlag series Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerant Systems also current Vice Chair the IEEE Technical Committee Fault Tolerant Computing and has served numerous conference program committees the areas fault tolerance and distributed computing was General Chair the Second IFIP Working Conference Dependable Computing for Critical Applications and Program Committee Chair the Thirteenth IEEE Symposium Reliable Distributed Computing part his Japan activities Rick heads the JapanCS Project and founder and current moderator the USENET newsgroup comp research japan electronic forum devoted Japanese research developments computing and computer science also member the Association Research Libraries Working Group Japanese Scientific and Technical Information When not working Rick likes haunt local Japanese restaurants with his family Their favorite Samurai which during the winter months serves the best miso ramen this side Japan Rick also follows the Arizona Wildcat sports teams Some recent talks Approach Constructing Configurable
