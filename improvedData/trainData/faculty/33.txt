develop new methods for various Kronecker product computations particular have method for solving the nearest Kronecker product problem when the factor matrices are subjected inhomogeneous constraints Some applications signal processing and Markov processes are solved result Kronecker product descriptions for various fast wavelet transforms have also been derived Our aim proceed analogy the FFT where such descriptions have played important role the development high performance algorithms Both undergraduate texts computational science that have been working for the last four years are now
