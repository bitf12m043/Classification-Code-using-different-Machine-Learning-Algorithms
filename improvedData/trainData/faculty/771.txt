where earned and degrees mathematics and computer science currently Professor Computer Science the University Utah having taught previously the University Pittsburgh Among Lindstrom research interests are programming language design specification and implementation with special emphasis the programming aspects parallel and distributed systems has served IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitor and has been awarded the University Utah College Engineering Outstanding Teaching Award Lindstrom recently retired Editor Chief the International Journal Parallel Programming and edited the book Logic Programming Functions Relations and Equations His research has been supported NSF ARPA ONR and industrial sponsors MCC IBM Xerox NCR and Ericsson served the NSF Computer and Computation Research Advisory Committee from and Consultant the United Nations Development Programme Lindstrom chair the Organick Memorial Lecture Series Current Research Projects Persistent object stores The Mach Shared Objects project building object manager layered modern operating systems Our based system server concepts presenting standardized interface and Common Lisp programs The MSO approach persistence emphasizes generality source language support portability and heterogeneity iii data evolution distributed implementation and access and the representation software components objects managed through pervasive system service Module manipulation tools The Fast and Flexible Mach based Systems project seeks develop operating system that provides much higher degree flexibility than traditional systems and use that added flexibility circumvent the performance functionality tradeoffs that thwart traditional highly decomposed microkernel based operating systems Foundations for this work include comprehensive notion modules module manipulation cast system service and iii semantically enriched notion module compatibility and adaptability Items and arose from the Mach Shared Objects project see above while iii new emphasis motivated pragmatically important inter module concerns such address space sharing storage management policies and levels trust Software for human genetics applications collaboration with the Utah Center for Human Genome Research software being developed aid genetic applications such linkage analysis genetic and physical mapping and large scale genetic sequencing Key aspects include data modeling using relational and object oriented database management systems sequencing production workflow simulation planning and real time control and iii automated inspection monitoring and robotic manipulation biochemical laboratory processes The educational dimension this collaboration centers interdisciplinary program genome science Selected Publications Guruduth
