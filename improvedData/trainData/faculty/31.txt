areas programming languages and compilers for parallel architectures Our goal develop tools for generating parallel code for applications programs that deal with large sparse matrices Most scientific applications involve the numerical solution partial differential equations The techniques used almost always produce system algebraic equations that involve large sparse matrices Unfortunately existing compiler technology does poor job parallelizing sparse matrix programs take radically different approach this problem Our compiler produces parallel sparse matrix programs from sequential dense matrix programs using information from the user about the sparsity structure matrices the program This enables use tools from the restructuring compiler area Preliminary experiments with some Krylov space solvers show that the code produced our compiler competitive with hand parallelized code libraries like Argonne PetSc library will extend our approach direct methods for solving linear systems and applications that require adaptive mesh refinement This project builds our earlier work restructuring compilation techniques for dense matrix programs have developed restructuring techniques for compiling programs distributed memory and non uniform memory access NUMA architectures like the IBM and where processor can access local memory faster than non local memory get good performance the compiler must not only parallelize but must also ensure locality reference matching code and data distribution when non local references must made block transfers are preferable many small messages recently developed the best algorithm known for the automatic alignment computation and data and are incorporating into our compiler test bed earlier work developed novel loop restructuring technique called access normalization which transforms loop nests for increased locality and potential for block transfers and implemented the LAMBDA loop transformation toolkit our paper summarizing these results won the best paper prize ASPLOS worked with Hewlett Packard transfer this technology FORTRAN compiler product line for uniprocessors and multiprocessors have developed new frameworks for program analysis and optimization based the dependence flow graph DFG The DFG knits together the data and control dependence information program permitting the development optimization algorithms that generate better code than possible with competing approaches Our results are independent interest for example recently developed optimal algorithms for control dependence problems answering foundational question that had been open for almost decade This work led the development linear time algorithm for computing the static single assignment SSA form programs These results have been incorporated into number compilers including those IBM Microsoft and Flavors Professional ActivitiesPanel member and organizer ACM Symposium Principles and Practice Parallel

Index Publications List Publications Visitors Post Doctoral Associates and Students Research Summary research aimed creating tools support the development complex software systems The objective create tools that provide powerful language specific program manipulation operations particular work has explored how program slicing can serve the basis for such program manipulation operations The slice program with respect set program elements projection the program that includes only program elements that might affect either directly transitively the values the variables used members Slicing allows one find semantically meaningful decompositions programs where the decompositions consist elements that are not textually contiguous Program slicing fundamental operation that can aid solving many software engineering problems For instance has applications program understanding maintenance debugging testing differencing specialization reuse and merging The projects that workers and are carrying out are aimed improving the underlying technology for program slicing and related operations implementing program slicers developing methods for using slicing software engineering tools and building slicing based program manipulation tools Click here for the home page the Wisconsin Program Slicing Project Recently established some unexpected connections between interprocedural dataflow analysis and our previous work interprocedural program slicing particular showed that large class interprocedural dataflow analysis problems can solved transforming them into special kind graph reachability
