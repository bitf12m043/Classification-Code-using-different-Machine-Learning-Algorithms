machine learning neural networks artificial intelligence informational retrieval computational biology Table Contents Research Summary PhD Students Selected Recent Publications Courses Taught Some Interesting Links Research Summary are primarily developing machine learning systems that combine the strengths symbolic approaches artificial intelligence with those connectionist major focus improving the dialog between human teachers and machine learners Traditionally this interaction limited the teacher providing labelled training examples the machine Toward the goal widening the communication pipeline between human and machine have been developing language for providing natural manner and any time general purpose advice machine learner our approach the human advice giver observes the behavior the learner and occasionally makes suggestions expressed simple language Based techniques developed our work knowledge based neural networks these instructions are inserted directly into learner Subsequent connectionist neural network learning further integrates and refines the advice Currently are extending the language used advise our learning algorithms studying new ways incorporating this advice into neural networks investigating the extraction human comprehensible rules from trained neural networks and developing methods for choosing good representations for training examples are also developing parallel algorithms the department Condor system and our computer for machine learning and computational biology Shavlik and provide overview our approach
