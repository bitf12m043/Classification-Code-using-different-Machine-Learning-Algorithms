away privilege not right Vice Admiral Richard Bolitho Beyond the Reef Alexander Kent wish have connection with ships that not sail fast for intend harm way John Paul Jones rises fastest who knows not whither going Oliver Cromwell confessed all that from his youth was vehement and impetuous nature quick apprehension and strong and aspiring bent for action and for great affairs Life Themistocles Plutarch Click here for Randy Dreamhouse KBytes Absolutely essential features include the helipad the submarine the moat the cool car and the robot chef apologies Matt Groening and Life Hell History Today received Berkeley under Prof Eugene Wong working database design and translation within the Ingres Relational Database project had the good fortune have also worked one summer with the System Relational Database Group IBM San Jose Research Laboratory was located the center the relational database design and implementation universe After and some career fits and starts landed the University Wisconsin Madison where shifted interests into VLSI and CAD particular database support for VLSI CAD environments was successful that opportunity presented itself return Berkeley which accepted gladly selling snow tires Since that time research and teaching interests have focused the design engineering and implementation advanced high performance computing systems Always one exhibit short attention span switched from CAD processor and memory system design Between and led the design the distributed cache and virtual memory organization the SPUR multiprocessor project invented the term snooping caches also known snoopy caches and implemented one the first invalidation protocols The overall SPUR project was led Dave Patterson and involved Richard Fateman Paul Hilfinger Dave Hodges and John Ousterhout Snooping cache schemes are used many multiprocessor servers the market today had idea for building high performance storage systems ganging together large number small formfactor disk drives much like the processors multiprocessor Between and led the design and implementation the Berkeley RAID Redundant Arrays Inexpensive Disks high performance storage system coined the term RAID This work was done overall collaboration with Dave Patterson and John Ousterhout Click here for picture RAID the First and here for picture RAID the Second which still functional This the innovative shelves disks that gave such incredible MBytes per square foot for its time disks rack This multibillion dollar per year industry all started with simple idea Berkeley Too bad didn get any royalities Unsatisfied with academic life usual and after the elections decided take leave during the Computing Systems Technology Office now Information Technology Office the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency started program manager and ended office deputy director However along the way was responsible for establishing whitehouse gov and the president and vice president Internet mail accounts

President the Year July became the first Computer Scientist the Chair the Department Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Research Interests the MomentWireless Communications and Mobile Computing Growing out Bob Brodersen InfoPad Project have been working develop wireless networking and applications support technologies that make possible support seamless roaming within buildings and over the wide area while efficiently supporting applications that process real time streams like video well web documents Our current interest examine the issues wireless wireline network integration internetwork operation and end end quality service guarantees the context local area wireless testbed Soda Hall and wide area testbed located the San Francisco Bay Area The overall effort collaboration with Eric Brewer called the Daedalus Project The combined building metropolitan area and wide area testbed called BARWAN Bay Area Research Wireless Access Network This work supported the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its GloMo Program Heterogeneous Collaboration Environments With Steve McCanne who joining the faculty this year are studying how extend the technology have developed for adapting data representations real time into comprehensive open framework for collaboration Elements this new effort include room sized collaboration environments extensive enhancements the existing MBone collaboration tools and integration wireless access into the collaboration environment expect deploy these technologies classroom testbed within Soda Hall Click here
