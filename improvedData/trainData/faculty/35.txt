and Science Pilani India Research Interests Instruction level parallel ILP processing Compiling for ILP architectures Shared memory multiprocessors Memory Systems Research Summary current research focuses the design the highest performance uniprocessors current generation Currently are investigating the architecture circa processor With plenty transistors available chip the challenge use these resources get the highest possible performance when executing sequential program target that have set for ourselves sustain the execution over instructions per cycle for ordinary non numeric application programs research group investigating several issues that need resolved before our goals can achieved are studying and characterizing the nature instruction level parallelism non numeric application programs order understand the available parallelism and how could exploited The bulk group research effort expended continuing the development the Multiscalar processing model novel paradigm for exploiting ILP Currently are developing the Multiscalar compiler and carrying out detailed simulation studies assess the potential the Multiscalar concept Current Graduate Students Todd
