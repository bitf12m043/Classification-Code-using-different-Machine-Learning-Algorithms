development until that ultimate day Past Research Interests and Activities Learning Problem solving HeuristicsMy thesis Research See IJCAI The Massively Parallel Dado Machine HardwareSoftwarePatentsCurrent status DADO was licensed company and abruptly left academia for its obvious commercialization See The San Francisco Examiner article page the Feb issue click Previous Examiners button for some information about its current status The final chapter DADO has not yet been written Stay tuned Deductive and Expert DatabasesACE The First Deductive Expert Database System

Parallel Distributed Intelligent Systems KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY DATABASE and DATA MINING KDD former days expert systems research and parallel hardware design and implementation were great fun But now specializing parallel distributed processing for Machine Learning alternatively click here Intelligent Information Systems Knowledge Discovery Databases and Data Mining Financial Systems Computing and Active Databases Check out upcoming events like KDD AAAI the both and journal sources like Kluwer journals this area member the editorial board the Journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Please take look our Call for Papers See also the page the Parallel and Distributed Intelligent Systems Lab for more thorough treatment current research activities and relationship industrial users MERGE PURGE Intelligently Integrating Heterogenous Databases Although the term merge purge used our Citicorp collaborators and other commercial organizations probably better termed The Data Scrubbing Data Cleaning Problem That term Mike Stonebraker used describe this problem and Stonebraker terminology almost always colorful and illuminating Our most recent success data supplied the Child Welfare Department the State Washington memoralized the letter viewable clicking here META LEARNING for Scalable Data MiningMeta learning term coined for approach gaining popularity the KDD community these days The essential idea combine number separately learned classifiers models such fashion that machine learning can scaled large and inherently distributed databases and ideally accuracy can boosted But how does one combine separately learned classifiers consider that question learning problem and apply machine learning algorithms meta learn how underlying classifiers behave correlate with eachother Hmmmmm ELECTRONIC COMMERCE and FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS Widely Distributed Data Mining and Fraud Detection current interest lies the future large scale network based information systems especially Fraud and Intrusion Detection are studying methods apply learning agents and Meta learning agents WAN financial information systems learn how detect fraudlent transactions This work directly relevant Information Warfare problems that will undoubtedly occur the future These problems probably occur today but one has yet learned how detect globally Stay tuned This research being conducted collaboration with our friends the Financial Services Technology Consortium Integrating Multiple Models AAAI Workshop Many researchers are working similar techniques for integrating multiple learned models Phil Chan David Wolpert and myself are organizing Workshop AAAI called Integrating Multiple Models for Improving and Scaling Machine Learning See the workshop agenda and call for papers Please participate directly you are interested pursuing these ideas you have new results share with the community Speeding Monte Carlo Simulations also studied parallelization strategies for Monte Carlo simulations Check out Dynamic Neighborhood Bounding simple heuristic strategy save expensive function computations that also amenable fast parallel execution Follow the link papers CollaboratorsFinancial Services Technology Consortium FSTC been working with the Financial Services Technology Consortium FSTC having played some small role its early formation The FSTC Fraud Project the focus our joint effort See the description Fraud and Intrusion Detection Financial Information Systems using Meta learning Agents for details about our approach Citicorp relationship with Citicorp was established through consultancies and research relationships with the Citicorp Technology Office Working with companies like Citicorp wonderful opportunity learn about real world problems and datasets for use establishing benchmarks and controlled studies fundamental technologies collaboration with Citicorp and other organizations lead the development number fundamental technologies that were demonstrated real life financial applications Some these are described this web page Seek them out System Management ARTS SMARTS spinoff from the research lab Professor Yechiam Yemini Their SOS

current Maybe that includes you sometime the future The AnswerDid you guess what the image means Greatest Achievement Life One last thought for now all accomplishments absolutely none come close true achievement life Fun home town And especially enjoy doing all sorts things for community mostly through kids schools Some you may even have heard special event Ridgewood New Jersey where live Its calledDADS NIGHT Ridgewood has all sorts interesting events going Another one that happy involved with SUPER SCIENCE SATURDAY Visit the homepages both for peek what Ridgewood And you haven figured out
