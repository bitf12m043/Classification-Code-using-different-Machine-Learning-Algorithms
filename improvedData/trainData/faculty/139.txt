Sun and Tektronix Here article from Washington University Newspaper Record which talks about some our funded projects RESEARCH OVERVIEW RESEARCH PROJECTS PROGRESS Talk Strategy for Integrating with ATM paper Strategy for Integrating with ATM Washington University Gigabit ATM Desk Area Network Multimedia Storage Server Protocol Control Mechanisms for Multipoint Multimedia Applications Efficient Quality Service Support for Multimedia Applications Universal Continuous Media Distributed Optical Sectioning Microscopy Distributed Battle Field Simulation PAST RESEARCH SUMMARY Axon High Performance Host Network Interface Architecture Axon high performance host network interface architecture that was designed and extensively simulated Washington University Louis from through encompassing host and network interface architecture operating systems and protocols beleive Axon the first zero copy host network interface and the first use distributed virtual shared memory over wide area network The Next Generation Internetworking During students and worked research project concerned with the design the next generation internet architecture you are interested RSVP and Integrated Services work IETF you should look our earlier work Important aspects this project include Design specification and prototype implementation novel multipoint congram oriented service that can work well with connection oriented and datagram high speed networks can provide variable grade service need basis its applications and can provide adequate reconfigurability deal with survivability requirements due network failures For details prototype implementation check this paper out COIP Design and implementation gateway architectures that can support data rates few hundred Mbps can interface with diverse networks and can implement the congram oriented service without becoming performance bottleneck For details our work ATM FDDI gateway click here Development analytical and simulation models evaluate important tradeoffs associated with the design congram oriented protocol the resource management diverse networks and the design new gateway architectures NOAHNET High Speed Reliable Local Area

For students especially when project deadline approaches Don tell how hard you work tell how much you get done Sign arrogance opinions may have changed but not the fact that right model artifice for helping you convince yourself that you understand more about system than you good scientist person with original ideas good engineer person who makes design that works with few original ideas possible Freeman Dyson Disturbing the Universe help keep role CCRC and ARL perspective feature good thing then distributed and vice versa not today maybe five years Tom Truscott com research Address
