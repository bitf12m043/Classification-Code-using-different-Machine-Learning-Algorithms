language text processing rapidly expanding field research and development Large masses machine readable text now exist that can cheaply stored high density optical storage media and rapidly retrieved demand Furthermore sophisticated methods are available for analyzing document texts formulating appropriate user queries conducting rapid file searches and ranking the retrieved items decreasing order importance the users Cornell design and operate large general purpose text processing environments where texts can handled without restrictions size subject matter the absence knowledge bases that would useful for unrestricted text databases use corpus based text analysis systems that determine the meaning words and expressions refined context analysis using statistical and probabilistic criteria Using the corpus based approaches are able determine text similarity with high degree accuracy There are two main applications The automatic generation structured text collections hypertext where semantically similar pieces text are automatically linked Hypertext representations large databases provide flexible browsing capabilities for general purpose text access The automatic retrieval interesting text excerpts response available search queries have done extensive work with automated encyclopedia consisting about encyclopedia articles the Funk and Wagnalls New Encyclopedia addition are also processing the TREC collection consisting about full text documents covering number different subject areas over gigabytes text sophisticated search and retrieval service exists well text linking system capable relating different text sections paragraphs and sentences The main test vehicle continues the current version the Smart text analysis and retrieval system operating under UNIX

Research Interests Robotics Geometry and Complexity Motion Planning Kinematics Cognitive and Information Aspects Motion Sensor Based Intelligent Systems Industrial Automation Control Theory Pattern Recognition Research current research the area fully automatic robotic and human centered semi automatic systems and covers theoretical simulation animation and experimental work the area fully automatic systems our focus development means for geometric reasoning and control necessary for automatic planning motion complex environment machine equipped with such means able purposely move complex scene with multiple perhaps moving obstacles arbitrary shapes are especially interested paradigm which assumes incomplete information and continuous real time computation based sensory feedback from vision range sensors This model suggests economic active sensing guided the motion planning needs strong factor such systems the effect system dynamics and nonholonomic contstraints real time control part our work human centered systems study jointly with cognitive scientists human skills motion planning and space orientation These results are then used for comparison with the performance automatic systems and for developong hybrid physical teleoperated and computer graphics interaction systems The major property such hybrid system that blends together synergistic manner
