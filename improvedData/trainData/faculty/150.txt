the Distributed Laboratories project constructing heterogeneous computing environment consisting ATM networked uniprocessor and SMP machines jointly offering the computational power and interconnection bandwidth modern supercomputers Applications and the HPPCEL Laboratory The HPPCEL Laboratory for experimentation with parallel applications undertaking the development several sample large scale parallel applications jointly with end users atmospheric modeling finite element codes fluid flow applications each case these applications not only consist specific computational tasks but also include online analyses being performed for these computations and real time visualizations program data and monitoring performance information all which are executed simultaneously such that end users can inspect program results and steer program executions gain experimental insights Additional applications used evaluate operating system support program adaptation and programming environments research have included robotics applications and real time simulations the ASV autonomous suspension vehicle schema based robot navigation and discrete event simulations real time multi

used the solution Operations Research problems Distributed Laboratories The topic our joint research the realization distributed laboratories where individuals can interact with each other and more importantly with powerful distributed computational tools readily all were located single site Our intent permit scientists engineers and managers geographically distinct locations including

applications molecular physics atmospheric sciences working with high performance atmospheric and pollution modelling and manufacturing systems addition Prof Schwan group involved the development basic technologies facilitating the use future heterogeneous and large scale distributed and parallel systems These technologies are concerned with middleware software that will directly utilized distributed laboratory applications and described more detail below The Falcon project studying the dynamic monitoring adaptation and interactive steering high performance computations for line control virtual laboratory instruments and for what experimentation with complex simulation models distributed laboratory users The COBS project concerned with the distributed systems and communication technologies underlying distributed laboratory applications The emphasis distributed systems research support for shared state multi granular and distributed computing environments Research communication protocols concerned with providing the necessary communication latencies bandwidths and transmission guarantees across heterogeneous underlying communication media Prof Schwan current research addresses three basic research topics addressing the computational requirements and underlying hardware systems presented the HPPCEL and Distributed Laboratory efforts programming support tools operating systems and communication protocols Programming tools FALCON The FALCON project addresses the construction interactive parallel programs even permitting programmers steer such applications Steering may defined Program Steering program that can interact with human users during its execution where the purpose such interactions the use line program information affect steer program execution The FALCON project goal have high performance programs become equally interactive commonly used tools spreadsheets such that program performance either maintained improved The expectation that scientists can work more effectively when able view program results during execution and steer program execution toward useful data domains The initial experience that line steering can improve the performance programs avoiding needless execution and adapting algorithmically specific program abstractions better match their functionality dynamically varying program characteristics essence expect gain significant increases the usefulness parallel programs end users and program performance use steering FALCON offers specific support for program performance monitoring evaluation and tuning and they provide system integration support using incore data dictionary Using FALCON information required for performance tuning easily captured analyzed displayed and then used for program performance improvement Program monitoring performed identical fashion for both shared and non shared memory parallel machines using language based and graphical user interfaces Using programming extensions FALCON now under development program tuning performed graphically well explicit manipulation parallel programs displayed hierarchical sets related objects The tools will used the context large scale parallel applications being interactively steered end users The FALCON tool operational SUNs SGIs IBM IBM and the KSR machine FALCON programming extensions are still under construction but their runtime support already operational Adaptable Operating Systems The efficient execution parallel program requires that operating system primitives match the program performance and reliability requirements constructing and evaluating novel operating system mechanisms for multiple parallel architectures are studying high performance operating system support for multiple parallel applications including real time applications scientific and engineering codes discrete event simulations and optimization codes This research has resulted several software libraries that facilitate the construction parallel programs The Cthreads library commonly used operating systems and parallel computing courses and available many uniprocessor and multiprocessor machines Its extensions toward Configurable CThreads address the line monitoring and configuration high performance parallel programs ranging from the rapid adaptation individual program abstractions user directed program steering Specific examples configurable abstractions constructed with the CThreads basis include adaptable multiprocessor locks able improve program performance adapting lock characteristics program behavior during program execution and adaptable communication protocols The DSA Distributed Shared Abstractions library for construction distributed objects available shared and prototype version distributed memory machines including networks workstations Its purpose support programmers the construction efficient program abstractions capable spanning both shared memory and distributed memory platforms Its initial SMP prototype now being extended address both sets platforms including larger scale distributed systems see the COBS project described below The Kernel ToolKit KTK substrate for parallel programming and for the development multiprocessor operating system kernels the object level gives developers the ability construct custom implementations object based operating system abstractions Objects are customized using meta object like interfaces described object attributes and implemented policies Since policies may present runtime KTK objects may also dynamically adapted suit varying runtime requirements parallel and distributed applications KTK attributes are the principal basis for construction adaptable objects the COBS project described next The GIT LDA
