Assistant Professor the College Computing Georgia Institute Technology received his education and computer science joint degree the University Michigan where developed Emile environment for high school science learners programming multimedia demonstrations and physics simulations also the designer MediaText multimedia composition environment used elementary and high school classrooms Mark member the GVU Center the Cognitive Science program and the EduTech Institute Mark recently organized workshop with Rick Weingarten Computing Research Association for the National Science Foundation The charge the workshop was set research agenda for Computer Science Educational Technology The draft report from that workshop available line Current Areas Interest Educational computing software realized scaffolding construction and design environments for students constructionism collaboration support log file analysis and visualization computational science computer modeling simulation and visualization for students Mark Guzdial current research centers facilitating student learning through student design construction and analysis artifacts Philosophically constructivist even constructionist but sees need for support enable and facilitate student construction artifacts and knowledge His goal provide students similar kinds opportunities that professional scientists and engineergs have for learning and exploring through computation has developed simulation environments for learning science through construction and now exploring visualization and collaboration environments facilitate science and engineering learning evaluate the usability and learnability the environments creates Mark developing techniques for analysis user event traces log files Recent Classes with Interesting Home PagesCS Modeling and Design Winter which where WebCaMILE was first used Modeling and Design Spring where STABLE was first used Design and Evaluation Educational SoftwareCS Modeling and Design Fall Current Research Projects NSF Multimedia Courseware Project With John Stasko and Jim Foley working creating effective multimedia courseware for Computer Science courses using WWW Software Realized Scaffolding and Learner Centered Design The design Emile revolved around providing software realization what educators called scaffolding support which enables students perform activities and learn through those activities collaboration with Elliot Soloway Kenneth Hay and Yasmin Kafai interface design emphasis learner centered design evolving part which software realized scaffolding CaMILE Collaborative and Multimedia Interactive Learning Environment new learning environment designed support students collaboration with multimedia annotations CaMILE can seen MediaText network DEVICE Dynamic Environment for Visualization Chemical Engineering DEVICE environment which Chemical Engineering students learn through process design simulated world DEVICE being developed Noel Rappin The eventual goal merge DEVICE like simulation support with CaMILE like collaboration tools create broad based support for learning Chemical Engineering SCOPE Scaffolded and COntextualized Programming Environments for Engineering Education This project sponsored the National Science Foundation Log file analyses and visualizations are used understand the effectiveness the supports provided these environments Cognitive Multimedia project with John Stasko Richard Catrambone Ashwin Ram and Mike Byrne sponsored ONR focuses trying understand the most effective ways construct interactive multimedia Generalized Scaffolding STABLE first attempt creating generalized scaffolding not modifying the environment but providing scaffolding multiple representations generic plan libraries GPCeditor Emile and collaborative environments support existing work environment VisualWorks Smalltalk STABLE being tested during Spring Instructions how create STABLE cases are available Research Projects from the University Michigan Working with Elliot Soloway and Elliot Highly Interactive Computing Environments group Mark was primarily involved three projects the University Michigan GPCeditor Goal Plan Code Editor Pascal programming environment that provides explicit supports for student design MediaText multimedia composition environment for grades students Mark designed MediaText with Elliot and MediaText now commercial product developed Constructive Instruments and distributed Apple Computer and Wings for Learning Emile programming environment for science students exploring physics creating simulations Emile was Mark dissertation work Emile implements software realized scaffolding which provides adaptable levels support Copies recent AERA
