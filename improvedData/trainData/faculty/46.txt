Beckmann Dartmouth EDU Condensed Bio Personal Home Page Carl Josef Beckmann Assistant Professor Engineering graduated with engineering magna cum laude from Brown University where was also elected Tau Beta the engineering honor society spent three years research scientist the Honeywell Systems and Research Center before returning school this time the University Illinois Urbana Champaign for and electrical engineering Shell Doctoral Fellowship During these five years also served research assistant the University Center for Supercomputing Research and Development His research and teaching interests include parallel computer architecture parallelizing compilers dynamic scheduling and synchronization parallel programs computer performance analysis and networked multimedia People will always want computers more and faster However what call the cylinder theory computing myth car you want more power you add more cylinders lot trickier with computers There are problems with how you put the hardware together and how you break down the software can processed parallel Carl Beckmann has been interested both aspects ever since completing his thesis high performance computing and parallel processing using multiple computing elements simultaneously achieve greater processing power Making good compilers for parallel machines difficult measuring and improving their performance explains But essential Measurement can pinpoint where computer having problems Then you can address those problems either manual reprogramming making better compiler that able handle those rough spots Specifically since coming Thayer School January Professor Beckmann has been working with Professor George Cybenko networked interactive multimedia computing new field sited precisely the point where computers communications and television converge The proliferation user friendly microcomputers the widespread use modems and the explosion publicly available information that now accessible from thousands miles away means that more and more computers are becoming linked together large scale networks inevitable that the more people use these networks the more they will get bogged down Beckmann interest finding ways minimize these emerging problems developing ways measure and optimize the performance networked systems Industry people are mainly interested building new systems fast they can because whatever they come with today bound improvement over what already out there Later they coming people like when they find the information superhighway isn wide enough handle all the traffic they generating Beckmann and Cybenko are also working with Professor Joe Henderson the Dartmouth Medical School who pioneering the development multimedia applications for medicine Ironically widespread use Henderson innovative applications will create limitations their performance Beckmann and Cybenko are designing ways measuring and modeling their performance and optimizing their realworld usefulness Although had not taught before coming Thayer School just three days after arriving Hanover Beckmann was asked teach ENGS Microprocessors Engineered Systems lab course involving making nifty things out microprocessors requiring little bit hardware lot software and great deal patience Although was daunting first learned that you can get the students excited about something and show them that this really interesting stuff they off and lot the learning their own Thayer Home PageFaculty and StaffSuggestions Welcome are always looking for new ideas improve the Thayer School
