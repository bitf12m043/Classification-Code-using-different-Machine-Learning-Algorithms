Computational Neuroscience Computational Biology CFP AAAI Symposium Learning Complex Behaviors Research Interests Intelligent information processing systems are likely play most significant role the century and the design and analysis these systems one the great scientific challenges face today Consider the following realistic possibilities which are currently the main focus ongoing work intelligent systems research around the globe intelligent vision system installed car tracks the road and wakes the dozing driver when the car beginning head towards the shoulder Thousands lives could saved annually Another data driven system could help perform precise radioactive therapy cancerous tumor way that minimizes damage adjacent cells interactive automated system could consider set symptoms and warn likely heart attack emergency room patient Another medical system can perform sophisticated analysis collection tests help assess the probability cancer recurrence and suggest schedule for repeated evaluations The basic principle driving these systems that they can LEARN function from very large corpuses data What makes this technology possible the remarkable match between the massive amount information that can stored modern computers and the amazing computational capabilities speed these machines Our society currently entering new period where massive amounts heterogeneous information are generated and stored computers and are readily available for exploration over academic networks digital libraries and commercial information services the same time modern networks computers can perform billions computation steps per second This rather unique match raw computer power and sea available information creates many previously unfeasible opportunities for building intelligent systems Coping with information explosion scientific data mining interactive modelling unstructured data and complex processes and intelligent data driven decision making with uncertainty are among the major current focus areas computer science One striking example the use this computing power was recent application developed Johns Hopkins University chess end game analysis program designed Lewis Stiller running processor machine and using gigabytes storage found chess end games that absolutely require more than moves win simple chess game Chess masters for generations used rule that declared draw after only moves The old rule was dictated human experience that could not perform this type analysis different program implemented interdisciplinary group researchers from Astronomy and Computer Science automatically finds stars galaxies filters cosmic rays images obtained the Hubble Telescope This program using decision tree induction system implemented Murthy the Johns Hopkins University This program very fast and can easily process millions astronomical objects short amount time current research program focuses high performance computer systems and efficient algorithms that provide the computational capabilities support this critical information technology Our main focus the design and analysis algorithms for high performance intelligent systems Specifically are interested efficient parallel and sequential algorithms for modelling and controlling complex processes computer systems neural networks intelligent information retrieval and modelling large data depositories that can used educational environments constraint networks and probabilistic networks that can used for decision making with uncertainty medical diagnosis and machine learning The algorithms designed our group have been applied variety applications such public health computer vision computer game playing astronomy and several biomedical applications Academic
