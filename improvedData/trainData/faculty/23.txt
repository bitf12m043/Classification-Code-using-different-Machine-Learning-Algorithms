Director NSF Science and Technology Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization PhD Cornell University For the past two decades our computer graphics activities have involved the development wide range graphic input and display techniques number input methods have been implemented and progress has been made large variety display routines Graphics research topics previously investigated include polygon clipping hidden surface algorithms texturing spatial and temporal aliasing problems geometric modeling parametric surface descriptions and color science Our current focus graphics research involves the three dimensional modeling very complex environments and algorithms for realistic image synthesis modular testbed that sufficiently flexible evaluate different modeling and image generation techniques has been created Laboratory research now being conducted light reflection models methods for determining the interaction between reflecting surfaces techniques for improving the computational efficiency ray tracing parallel processing strategies perceptual studies micro geometry surface modeling motion control dynamics constraint modeling anti aliasing strategies and host other topics related complex modeling and realistic image displays New application research being started volume rendering and medical imaging digital photography animation and the development generic tools for scientific visualization well core technologies for multi media environments Most the research conducted within the facilities the Program Computer Graphics which member

computation such interactive proof systems which combine nondeterminism and randomness Such models have recently proven surprisingly useful solving classic problems complexity theory For example although the theory completeness has long been used identify hard computational problems there has not been much progress understanding which hard problems have solutions that are easy approximate Recent results interactive proof systems have resulted novel models which turn can used prove non approximability results for several hard problems our work are developing both positive and negative results the approximability hard combinatorial problems which arise game theory graph theory and automata theory also interested design and analysis parallel algorithms currently working development parallel algorithms for sorting and for graph problems such minimum spanning tree The goal develop algorithms that work well practical parallel models where communication and synchronization costs can
