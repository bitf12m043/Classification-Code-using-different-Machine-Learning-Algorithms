Wisconsin Dayton Madison telephone fax email parter wisc edu New York University Interests Numerical methods for partial differential equations Research Summary this time the major emphasis work the solution indefinite discrete elliptic systems equations Classical iterative methods and most multigrid methods only work effectively when the system positive definite These methods can also made effective when the real symmetric part the operator positive definite the other hand the indefinite case direct methods which attempt preserve the sparseness the system may encounter very small pivots Thus this challenging problem which effectively mixes concepts and procedures from linear algebra and elliptic partial differential equations now involved several projects which attack this class problems These include preconditioning studies and research special multigrid methods Sample Recent Publications Preconditioning Chebyshev collaction discretization for elliptic partial differential equations appear SIAM Journal Numerical Analysis Preconditioning and boundary conditions without estimates condition numbers and the distribution the singular values SIAM Journal Numerical Analysis
