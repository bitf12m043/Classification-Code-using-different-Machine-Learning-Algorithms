package have recently completed software project mesh generation for the finite element method three dimensions The software package called QMG available the source code level anonymous ftp With QMG you can construct polyhedral geometric objects with very complicated topology holes internal boundaries etc and automatically create unstructured tetrahedral mesh for them The mesh generator based algorithmic work Scott Mitchell and You can also solve elliptic boundary value problem div grad your domain The package written and Matlab and distributed for free the source code level anonymous ftp distribution began QMG was released November QMG features many improvements over QMG including faster mesh generation algorithm VRML graphics much cleaner code boundary mesh generation algorithm

Summary interests are expressed two related research efforts The first involves meta linguistic natural language processing system that can configured model variety theoretical linguistic models semantic structures are the form relational calculus that can expressed implicit semantic networks The basic semantic units are objects and relations Objects may atoms classes contain relational structures Relations may logical operators All units the system are associated with Boolean feature vectors During the course generation recognition inheritance features directional Because relations can defined logical operators script like world knowledge rules can encoded the same notation used map semantic structures syntactic units Semantic syntactic production rules are represented data and the same rules can used for both generation and recognition The system can contain more than one grammar thereby allowing configured either machine translation system natural language interface application command languages The combinatoric problems associated with unrestricted models human language processing suggest that real world knowledge systems may have evolved forms that make combinatoric processing problems linear currently investigating the role Boolean groups and analogy complex behavioral systems including the representation categorial grammars Grammars this notation can readily implemented connectionist models and may provide transparent means linking language structure neural net theory research effort has occasionally involved analysis archaeological materials
