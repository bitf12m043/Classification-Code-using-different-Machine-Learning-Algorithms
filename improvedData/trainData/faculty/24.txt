Bell Laboratories This semester teaching course called Engineering Computer Networks teaching from textbook just completed which will published Addison Wesley this December Most research flow and congestion control mostly for connectionless networks such the Internet The one line summary thinking The one true religion round robin scheduling and packet pair flow control Let explain what that means Users can contend for shared resource one two ways first come first served and round robin Unlike first come first served round robin scheduling automatically allocates fair shares resource users and protects well behaved users from hogs all queueing points network implement round robin then end systems can determine their available fair share service rate implicitly using the packet pair technique They can then use the time series rates stable and intelligent flow control Thus round robin does implicit allocation fair shares and packet pair does implicit determination the fair share for flow control contrast current proposals the ATM Forum for flow control neither round robin considered too expensive nor implicit determination the rate only possible with round robin Maybe was wrong the whole time have been working since building ATM networks One them was Xunet wide area ATM network that built from scratch routers switches all the software which was operational from The other IDLInet collaboration with IIT Delhi based name PCs and equipment from Fore Systems and Zeitnet IDLInet source code now the public domain and available from the Native mode ATM home page The key feature IDLInet that the protocol stack native mode ATM that application gets write directly ATM virtual circuit also support independent signalling API that SPANS compliant Finally have been goofing off building talking heads facial animation and snooping car the car sends video format the MBONE and can driven from remote site over the Internet LinksPapersHere link papers Most papers are available postscript REAL have been building the REAL packet level simulator since and still maintain has been installed over sites have idea how many people actually use Here link REAL version You can also get the simulator from here The latest version version which released Fall Version the works includes Tcl based GUI and should out the end all goes well Native mode ATM Home PageMy Name the
