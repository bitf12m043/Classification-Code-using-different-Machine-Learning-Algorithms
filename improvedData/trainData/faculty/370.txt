increasingly relies complex computerized systems accomplish basic daily functioning This reliance demands that computer systems built that can continue operate even when one more hardware modules and software programs malfunction central theme Sullivan research designing systems that can tolerate faults With his colleagues Sullivan has defined and analyzed novel probabilistic models self monitoring multiprocessor systems and provided powerful diagnostic strategies for localizing and removing faults and Prof Masson have also introduced promising software fault tolerance technique called the certification trail method Sullivan research interests also include the broad area the design and analysis algorithms algorithms motivated artificial intelligence applications Click here
