and Architectures Effective Computations and Communications Networks Workstations Monitoring and Visualization Tools for Parallel Systems Scientific and Numerical Computations Summary Research recent research interests mainly focus three areas parallel distributed computing software tool environment development and scientific computing and colleagues the High Performance and Software Lab are investigating several research and technical issues into performance evaluation and system support heterogeneous networks workstations NOW concentrate three problem areas developing performance metrics and providing insights into special natures heterogeneous distributed computing providing system support effectively manage heterogeneity and scheduling computation tasks across networks building software tool and environment aid parallel and distributed computing and performance evaluation Our studies parallel systems also include several topics shared memory and data parallel computing Our system research motivated and driven our studies large scale scientific applications such numerical simulations nonlinear optimizations and image processing Selected Recent Journal
