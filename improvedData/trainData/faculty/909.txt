Bansal Johnnie Baker Full Professor Johnnie Baker the Coordinator for Computer Science His research interests include parallel algorithms parallel production systems application parallel computers artificial intelligence parallel computational geometry computational chemistry and parallel computer models has also published the areas Banach spaces and general topology Baker received degree mathematics from Hardin Simmons University Abilene Texas and degree mathematics and respectively from the University Texas Austin was assistant professor Florida State University before joining the faculty Kent State University member ACM and the Computer Society the IEEE Recent Research Activities major focus Baker recent research has been the development computational model for associative computing and establishing algorithms and software for this model The associative model designed provide common platform for the development appropriate algorithms and software for massively parallel computers general and extended version SIMD computers particular Current work underway compare this model other parallel models computation including the reconfigurable mesh and the mesh with multiple broadcasts Other current research interests include developing improved constant time algorithms requiring fewer processors for the reconfigurable mesh embedding and emulating hypercubes mesh architecture and developing parallel algorithms and improved sequential algorithms that require less memory and running time for modeling organic compounds the molecular level Selected Master Theses
