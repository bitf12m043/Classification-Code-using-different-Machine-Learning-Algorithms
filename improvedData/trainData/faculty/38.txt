Poly San Luis Obispo Electrical And Computer Engineering Santa Barbara Office Phone Email jshetler phoenix csc calpoly edu Biography Professor Shetler research interests are computer architecture and design June she received CAREER grant from the National Science Foundation establish active research effort microelectronic systems architecture that enhances the undergraduate curriculum Computer Engineering Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and introduces students new computer architectures new technology and microelectronic systems The ideas developed this research will incorporated into the microprocessor and computer architecture curriculum The focus the research component devise and test Instruction Level Parallelism ILP techniques and mechanisms Programmable Logic Devices such FPGAs are used implement rapid system prototyping custom computer designs and are also used implement custom components reconfigurable architectures Part this project involves developing rapid prototyping platform Her industrial experience includes computer design Burroughs Corp now UNISYS for four years and Trilogy Systems Cupertino now defunct Burroughs she was designer the mainframe While Trilogy she designed multiprocessor cache coherency mechanism using Wafer Scale Integration WSI Compcon Shetler currently serving the steering committee for Compcon Teaching Areas Shetler teaching CPE and CPE for Fall Quarter Only the information for those courses valid Information other courses she has taught may not date Digital Logic Design CPE This course covers introductory material digital design techniques and theory Computer Architecture CPE This course covers computer architecture and microprogramming The emphasis the RTL Register Transfer Level design RISC and CISC based architectures Computer Architecture III CPE This course covers computer architecture and interfacing techniques The emphasis interfacing the system bus level using asynchronous and synchronous protocols Memory addressing strategies and memory mapped are also covered The lab associated with this course covers several team projects Digital Systems Design CPE This course covers the design digital systems using combinational and sequential circuits The course covers current implementation strategies including the use PLDs and FPGAs Microprocessor Systems Design CPE This course covers microprocessor systems design Research Interests multithreaded processor designs description FPGA implementations description and more description Recent Current Master Theses students Reggie
