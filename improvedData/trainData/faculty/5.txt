Research Interests Although research spans number subfields within artificial intelligence including machine learning case based reasoning and cognitive modeling the focus research the area natural language understanding NLP NLU The NLP group Cornell primarily interested investigating the use machine learning techniques tools for guiding natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that underly language acquisition Our work focuses two related areas the design user trained systems that can efficiently and reliably extract the important information from document and the machine learning natural language Information Extraction part Cornell CSTR project are using information extraction techniques support content based browsing technical texts The Kenmore Project The focus the Kenmore project developing techniques automate the knowledge acquisition tasks that comprise the building any NLP system Very generally Kenmore acquires linguistic knowledge using combination symbolic machine learning techniques and robust sentence analysis has been used with corpora from two real world domains perform part speech tagging semantic feature tagging and concept activation and find the antecedents relative pronouns current work are extending Kenmore handle larger text corpora and additional disambiguation tasks all our work evaluate the language learning components the context the larger NLP application which embedded The goal the project determine the conditions under which machine learning techniques can expected offer cost effective approach
