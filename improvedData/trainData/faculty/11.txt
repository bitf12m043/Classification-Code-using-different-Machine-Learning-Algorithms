where described myself someone with mathematics who calls himself computer scientist and giving talk economists about subject mainly studied philosophers That probably the best one sentence description can give you like more details check list publications has pointers abstracts all papers many cases the paper itself also available Other details activities are resume Fall teaching course

dimensional shape representation appearance modeling view synthesis active vision visualization Group Leader Wisconsin Computer Vision Group Program Chair CVPR Research Interests View Synthesis The goal this work develop basic tools for controlling real time either autonomously interactively virtual camera real environment The input set images video streams acquired from fixed mobile cameras around site and the output panoramic visualization the scene which virtual user controlled camera can moved through the environment With this technology user could interactively navigate through real environment controlling customized path views the site that are not predetermined the input images The main research question how adaptively combine set basis images synthesize new views the scene without models scene reconstruction intermediate step Recently have developed innovative technique which call view morphing that takes two basis images and interpolates continuous range between images corresponding views the linear path connecting the two camera centers Visual Exploration Computer vision researchers have recently started investigate how actively control the image acquisition process controlling camera parameters have been studying how purposefully control the position and orientation camera order dynamically adjust viewpoint based the appearance three dimensional scene The use real time viewpoint control behaviors important for solving tasks such exploring unknown object order find specific surface markings building global model unknown shape recognizing object coordinating simple observer behaviors that change the appearance surfaces well defined way simplify the image computations required make precise the global progress algorithm and eliminate the need for accurate differential measurements the camera motion believe that this active approach moving towards viewpoints that are closely related the geometry the viewed objects very important and general one have used this approach develop provably correct algorithms for moving side view surface revolution order recover its shape and reconstructing the global surface unknown smooth arbitrarily shaped object Visualization the area visualization have developed mapping techniques capable generating displays all possible data objects defined user algorithm without the need for user defined type specific graphics display procedures This capability for displaying arbitrary combinations algorithm data objects common frame reference coupled with interactive control algorithm execution provides powerful way understand algorithm behavior especially interactive visual experiments with scientific data analysis algorithms have implemented system called VIS for experimenting with these techniques and have used for visualizing intermediate and final results data analysis algorithms for problems such discriminating clouds satellite images Recent Publications Seitz and Dyer Cyclic motion analysis
