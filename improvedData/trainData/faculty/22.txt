Interests research interests include distributed computing fault tolerance and real time work methodologies paradigms and algorithms for fault tolerant distributed systems both message passing and shared memory systems long term goal bridge the gap between theoretical results and the need for efficient and practical solutions collaboration with Tushar Chandra and Prasad Jayanti two Computer Science students continued our work unreliable failure detectors for message passing systems and wait free objects for shared memory systems fundamental result fault tolerant distributed computing states that the Consensus problem cannot solved with deterministic algorithm asynchronous systems This impossibility result due the inherent difficulty determining whether process has crashed merely very slow such system our work were able determine exactly how much information about failures necessary and sufficient solve Consensus first showed one can use unreliable failure detector that can make infinite number mistakes solve Consensus systems with majority correct processes then proved that solve Consensus any failure detector has provide least much information about failures Thus the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus asynchronous systems with majority correct processes are now exploring the practicality implementing and applications that rely for their correctness concurrent system consists processes communicating via shared objects shared object wait free each process that accesses this object guaranteed get response even all the other processes crash are now exploring wait free hierarchies object types where each object type assigned level that corresponds its ability implementing other wait free objects particular Prasad Jayanti has shown that well known hierarchy Herlihy not robust Informally this hierarchy there object level that can used implement wait free objects any level are now exploring the question whether robust wait free hierarchies exist
