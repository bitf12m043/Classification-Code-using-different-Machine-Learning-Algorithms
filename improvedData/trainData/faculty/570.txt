Systems DSM and mobile computing support using DSM Distributed Computing Operating Systems Large scale computing systems Workstation environments Mobile computing Reliability and Availability RESEARCH PROJECTS The Mirage Mirage and Oasis Project The Persistence Memory Dali Mirage Development Team Loosely coupled Distributed Shared Memory system LAB FACILITIES currently direct two laboratories The Operating Systems research lab and the Distributed Systems research laboratory house IBM computers that run Mirage Dec Alpha AXP computers Macintosh and Sun also work with industry local and national level Specifically Computer Marketplace Inc has provided machines for research cluster are designing also will obtain PowerPC computers from IBM that will used for research and instruction The PowerPCs run the new IBM microkernel and Workplace shell also acknowledge Digital Equipment Corporation and their External Research program which helped obtain the Alphas Both Systems Laboratories are used design implement and measure the performance operating systems distributed systems and study DSM CORPORATE CONSULTING Explore the endless possibilities working with the University California

Synchronization progress expected completion December COFFEE drink alot prefer the Sumatra Blue Linoting beans that Trader Joes sells brand called Dancing Goats that Batdorf Bronson roasters ships retail Basically medium smooth roast best for Fine coffee should savored and certainly fake powdered milk should used The Cafe San VIP Sanyo coffeemaker office has built grinder that auto grinds and then drips the coffee Unfortunately like the Intel this machine was too complex thus the vender has discontinued production the machine currently searching for machine equivalent functionality for the day one remaining machine dies Return Faculty Home Page
