proposals critiques academic research gun use murder and violence research upon which most the anti gun lobby mistakenly relies and reveals aspects the issue that have not received full attention from either opponents proponents gun control including the overlooked implications gun control the issue women and self defense Kates cites survey the National Institute Justice that shows most criminals are more worried about meeting armed victim than they are about running into the police While handguns are used vast numbers crimes annually they are used more often good citizens repel crime approximately crimes about defense uses annually This finding even more startling because Kates relied exhaustive review anti gun sponsored studies compile the gun use figures Kates also examines national studies many them again sponsored the anti gun lobby test the claim that most murders are acquaintance murders committed normally law abiding citizens who murder because the accessibility gun moment anger finds instead that murderers are highly disturbed aberrant individuals characterized felony records alcohol and drug dependence and life histories irrational violence against people around them These studies reveal that percent arrested murderers nationally had prior arrests for violent felony burglary and average adult record six year criminal career with four major felony arrests The study has important implications for those concerned with issue women and self defense women and rape and the battered wife syndrome not uncommon most academic research gun use women cases attack and rape find the totally insupportable view that women would invariably too suprised violent attack use handgun self defense Kates points out the contrary that most instances the man who beats murders woman often even the rapist acquaintance who has previously assaulted her one more occasions She therefore prepared and uniquely qualified anticipate violent attack based her own experience previous confrontations cases criminal violence between spouses percent the victims were women Kates cites studies affirming that the overwhelming majority cases where wife kills husband she defending herself the children Detroit for instance husbands are killed wives more often than vice versa yet men are far more often convicted for killing spouse because three quarters wives who killed were not even charged prosecutors having found their acts lawful and necessary preserve their lives their children Eliminating handguns says Kates would almost guarantee that the sex the victims inter spousal homicide would female Other major findings Kates study include Differentials international crime rates are function socio cultural and economic factors not the percentage gun ownership fact there inverse correlation between violence rates and the percentage gun ownership many foreign countries the most noteworthy being Switzerland and Israel handgun ban not realistically enforceable Confiscating guns would require house house searches and alienate the very individuals whose compliance essential the success any regulation gun ownership were prohibited organized crime would step provide the firearms that will continue procured with criminal intent With respect police protection alternative for gun ownership the police not exist protect the individual citizen Rather their function deter crime general patrol activities and apprehension after the crime has occurred Response crisis calls many urban police departments slow due staff limitations and sheer volume emergency demands Given that the individual and not the police must responsible for the individual safety the issue whether those individuals should free choose gun ownership means protecting themselves their homes and their families Controls over handguns but not rifles and shotguns may result the counterproductive substitution these weapons accident and assault situations where long weapons are far more problematic The fact says Kates for host technical reasons long guns are both far more susceptible accidental discharge than handguns and are far more deadly when discharged particularly for small children order copy this new study copy please call fax write Post Street Suite San Francisco Who responsible for your safety Many people feel that the purpose the police protect them This true however the police forces this country are unable protect you directly and are not responsible for doing any event The purpose the police force provide indirect deterrence crime through patrolling the streets and apprehending the criminal after the criminal act has occurred would impossible for the police protect you the individual all times There are approximately peace officers this country They work three shifts day their number must divided three order determine how many are available patrol the streets This number must halved again account for the percentage the force dedicated support roles paperwork booking lab work training etc This leaves less than officers patrol the streets any given time These officers are facing criminals that say they are outnumbered figures from Prof John Bowman Illinois Recognizing the logistical impossibility providing around the clock full coverage our legal system has consistently held that the police have legal duty you the individual California the California Government Code sections reads public employee not liable for injury caused his failure enforce any enactment law Neither public entity not public employee liable for failure provide police protection provide sufficient police protection for injury caused the failure make arrest the failure attain arrested person custody Illinois the Illinois Rev Statutes state the matter more clearly Neither public entity public employee may sued for failure provide adequate police protection service failure prevent the commission crimes and failure apprehend criminals the case Riss City New York the Supreme Court held that even though Riss had asked the police for help six times previously warning them threats made against her rejected suitor the police could not held liable for their failure prevent him from throwing acid her face disfiguring her for life the case Warren District Columbia women were upstairs their house and heard their other roommate being attacked downstairs rapists They called the police and when hour later the noise downstairs had stopped for some time because their roommate had been beaten into unconsciousness went downstairs meet the police the words the Court for the next fourteen hours the women were held captive raped robbed beaten forced commit sexual acts upon one another and made submit the sexual demands their attackers Their calls were mishandled the dispatcher The police never came their aid The Court held that the fundamental principle American law that government and its agents are under general duty provide public services such police protection any individual citizen absolved the police and the city government from any liability the case think about this you are debating whether people should able keep weapons for self defense not you truly believe the police will protect you when you need you are potentially fatally mistaken the final analysis you MUST responsible for the safety your family and yourself one else More statistics from Gottlieb Gun Rights Fact Book According the Statistical Abstract the United States edition there were only firearms accidents that led deaths Over all households with handgun did not experience fatal firearms accident during the year during there were also over deaths caused car accidents over deaths caused accidental falls over deaths caused fires over deaths due accidental poisonings deaths from drowning The rate accidental gun deaths has also been decreasing was per was per remember that about firearms accidents are hunting accidents This means that the already low accidental gun death rate reduced even further when one considers just gun accidents the home the accidental gun death rate the house was only per people meaning that there was total fatalities CRIMINALS DON WAIT Why Should You much the propaganda support national waiting period alleged that such waiting period background check been place John Hinckley would have been caught because lied federal form when purchased the revolver used his attack President Reagan further claimed that Hinckley would have been jail instead his way Washington had such background check been conducted These allegations are irrefutably false John Hinckley purchased total eight firearms two cal and four cal revolvers well two rifles from August January The cal revolver used his assault President Reagan was one the two purchased October more than six months before left for Washington Federal law was diligently complied with the firearms dealer who filed multiple purchase forms with the regional office the Bureau Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms BATF after the purchase That purchase and all previous purchases were legal And they would have been legal under any waiting period scheme ever devised the time his purchase and all previous purchases until his attack the President John Hinckley had felony record had recorded history mental illness commitment check involves police inspection private conversations with psychiatrist and was using valid Texas driver license issued May make his firearms purchases The contention that background check would have uncovered the fact that did not physically reside the address listed his drives license willful distortion the criminal record check made local police the contrary had check been run and all criminal records been thorough and completely available they would have confirmed that was not prohibited person and that his last known address was Lubbock Texas and was listed the telephone directory Simply put detection system ever proposed ever devised has mindreading capabilities Advocates the background check gross disservice the nation distorting the truth regulatory gun control scheme would have prevented Hinckley his determination carry out the tragic assassination attempt President Reagan The Hinckley situation turns out typical publicized shootings Laurie Dann who shot several school children Illinois despite extensive record psychiatric problems and police investigations had never been committed institution nor prosecuted for felony Her handgun purchases had been approved following Illinois background check for permit own and waiting period before each handgun acquisition And Patrick Purdy the mass murderer the Stockton schoolyard had been able purchase handguns lawfully California despite day day waiting period and background check because his numerous felony arrests had all been reduced misdemeanor plea barginings The leniency the criminal justice system allowed him the streets following jail sentence for misusing gun and resisting arrest despite probation report noting that posed danger himself and others PROMISES DOOMED FAIL Waiting periods fail reduce crime yet that failure used excuse impose more restrictive laws For example beginning with two days moving three days and five days California waiting period was raised days longer minimum time than any other state But this gradual increase the waiting period has not reduced crime Between and the rate violent crime per persons rose Yet the failure the current law was used argument for passage the ill conceived and ill fated Proposition the handgun freeze and registration initiative California voters saw through this deception and soundly defeated this Proposition nearly margin Similarly and ironically while anti gunners nationally were citing Maryland waiting period being effective preventing numerous sales the vast majority appeals denials were granted indicating that the system was considerably more effective disarming the law abiding than disarming criminals Maryland gun control advocates insisted that the waiting period wasn keeping criminals from getting handguns and that ban the manufacture and sale certain handguns was needed While insulting good and honest citizens the waiting period scheme will not keep guns out the hands criminals nor will prevent crimes passion Indeed according prominent anti gun scholars Philip Cook and James Blose Duke University ineligible people are less likely submit this screening process than are eligible people because these people find ways circumventing the system entirely The Annals May That criminals not obtain their firearms through retail channels was also confirmed survey felons conducted Profs James Wright and Peter Rossi the University Massachusetts who concluded that retail sales play minor and unimportant role direct sources criminals handguns Inaccurate and out date records make citizens more apt than criminals denied permits recent study the Office Technology Assessment arm Congress found that almost half sample criminal history records that the FBI sent the police state agencies banks and other such institutions throughout the United States were incomplete inaccurate Such inaccuracies could well lead the denial licenses thousands reputable citizens under federal registration and licensing system Ironically Chicago newspaper submitted six Illinois licensing applications forms the state the names such characters bank robber John Dillenger and Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara Although Illinois has computerized registers which are checked the course handgun licensing investigations all the applications were approved except for Vito the Godfather Corleone whose bogus form included photograph actor Marlon Brando his film role waiting period scheme redirects police from crime fighting the unrewarding task snooping into the private lives law abiding citizens buying guns through licensed firearms dealers Such crime control schemes merely make our streets and homes safer for criminals plying their nefarious trades November News World Report cover story crime included article the police subtitled wonder the forces blue don catch more crooks Their budgets continue get tighter and society keeps giving them extra chores The article went note that only officers are actually patrol the streets out every duty given time And the article pointed out that other studies have shown that police spend only about their time dealing with violent crime waiting period background check perfect example such diversion police activity Yet waiting periods have been soft peddled fair and reasonable preventive moderate and acceptable sportsmen Nothing could further from the truth This proposal taken seriously What these words actually mean FAIR AND REASONABLE Purely and simply waiting periods begin the step step process where the Second Amendment right keep and bear arms becomes privilege Granted the wealthy and influential Under the waiting period licensing procedures prospective gun owners are presumed guilty crime until police check into their background proves their innocence Such presumption repellent Anglo American jurisprudence Background checks invite serious violations the right privacy Indeed since most persons who seek psychiatric assistance are not legally institutionalized thorough background check would require the opening hitherto private medical records the police And the leading proponents would even extend curbs those with records arrest followed acquittal for minor traffic violations even using gun self defense Ironically the same time when there already uncertainty about the propriety the FBI keeping computerized records the National Crime Information Center anyone who might possibly criminal the waiting period would set into motion system records law abiding citizens who comply with the waiting period law Such record keeping amounts facto registration awaiting only central computer processing capability for complete gun registration Virginia cities California Illinois and Pennsylvania authorities are using waiting periods establish such system Waiting period schemes impose additional undue burdens the law abiding citizen they force the applicant take time off from his job make repeated trips licensed firearms dealer legally purchase firearm and pay for the inconvenience since the additional paper work costs the dealers are passed along the consumer And waiting period background check costs the citizens the state tremendous amounts money for useless bureaucratic paper work and investigation study Cook and Blose The Annuls May found that the FBI regulations require any background investigation request accompanied set finger prints and that the state criminal records bureau conduct check prior the Divisions search And the current turnaround time for FBI searches working days Based these features they determined that FBI check costly and time consuming addition waiting periods encourage obstruction the issuing authority jurisdictions with waiting periods the books there are countless cases lost applications petty harassments requiring repeated trips different offices for completion paperwork fingerprinting and bureaucratic red tape designed discourage gun ownership New Jersey frequently cited state anti gunners for one year police refused issue any permits because the FBI was refusing fingerprint checks civil matters Authorities there regularly take days and occasionally much longer process application even though the statute requires done within days Moreover thousands applications have been rejected simply because the police didn want citizen have handgun even though there was criminal mental record justify rejection under the law This similar Broward County Florida where large percentage rejected applications were based traffic citations rather than valid bases for denials Such discretionary power police opposed the American people because abhorrent society built freedom nationwide survey Decision Making Information Inc the question was asked Would you favor oppose law giving the police the power decide who may own firearm margin more than the public was found against the power police inevitably acquire through waiting period licensing legislation The Senate reflected the will the people rejecting waiting period margin CRIME PREVENTION TOOL Almost half the states including percent the population require background checks waiting periods all handgun transfers But according Cook and Blose there has been convincing empirical demonstration that police check handgun buyers reduces violent crime rates The Annuals May Indeed comparison states with added extended waiting periods from reveals the ineffectiveness such crime control experiments See Table Based the FBI Uniform Crime Reports there would appear inverse relationship between gun

Florida Police Chiefs Association succinctly expressed Florida law enforcement assessment waiting periods and background checks think any working policeman will tell you that the crooks already have guns criminal fills out application the biggest dumbest crook ever seen the Florida State Legislature subsequently repealed all background check ordinances the state Indeed study waiting periods professors Joseph Magaddino and Marshall Medoff California State University Long Beach found them totally useless curbing crime Their finding reconfirmed the results multiple regression analyses Matthew DeZee Florida State University who favors restrictive gun laws and Douglas Murray the University Wisconsin They found that waiting periods either alone combination with other gun laws were not effective reducing violent crime gun related criminal violence Even anti gunners generally fail claim crime control effects for waiting periods instead citing statistics the number lawful handgun transfers denied state authorities They fail cite drops crime pretend those denied lawful access handguns not acquire handguns other means use other weapons commit crimes And despite allegations that those denied are criminals caught background check only fraction percent the time are such denials accompanied much recommendation for prosecution claiming that denials show that the law working the other side would logically think denial applications was effective but not stopping crime PREVENTS CRIMES PASSION Proponents contend waiting periods will sharply reduce the number handgun murders committed annually This information based misconstrued and outdated FBI data showing percent all murders involve people who know each other relatives friends acquaintances neighbors These FBI categories are misleading Acquaintances can Harvard Professor Mark Moore has said old but familiar enemies neighbors defined the basis where people live not whether the are friends enemies strangers and predatory felonies are often committed criminals neighborhood The area familiar escape easy the criminal doesn stand out might socially racially different environment and can count fear retaliation limit cooperation victims witnesses with the police was noted for example that Washington murders involved acquaintances and the crimes all involved drug trafficking must emphasized that murder including domestic and acquaintance murder for the most part not committed decent law abiding citizens catalyzed into murders the presence firearms Indeed FBI Uniform Crime Reports detailing the characteristics murders until studies the Chicago police the Senate Subcommittee Juvenile Delinquency and the annual Homicide Analysis the New York City Police show that percent suspected murders have criminal careers long standing There have been average six arrests per suspect half them for violent crimes Victims have similar records about percent the time Waiting periods are further based the false assumption that newly purchased firearms are used murders and other violent crimes Yet the Police Foundation Firearm Abuse found that only percent handguns traced all crime were less than month old And month twice long any state waiting period fact analysis James Wright the University Massachusetts More suggests that percent gun purchasers already own firearms the unlikely event that these individuals would chose commit violent crime waiting period would irrelevant addition the most frequent time for argument precipitated murders during the time from time frame when gun shops are closed And studies the FBI and New York City Police Department NYPD indicate that about percent murderers are under the influence alcohol and drugs the time the murder conditions under which the sale firearms already prohibited law Waiting periods assume that violent people deprived ready access handgun will not kill Yet Marvin Wolfgang the noted criminologist who studied homicide Philadelphia and published Patterns Criminal Homicide found that the nature homicide had little with the presence absence firearms noted the contention this observer that few homicides due shootings would avoided merely firearm were not immediately present and that the offender would select some other weapon the achieve the same destructive goal Probably only those cases where felon kills police officer vise versa would homicide avoided the absence firearm Crimes passion bring into play the plethora curious objects used commit murder from brooms ceramic lamps and especially knives according list murder weapons used San Francisco and New York between and The waiting period supposes that the crime passion some sudden impulse which will pass But Nation Institute Justice NIJ study reveals that the victims family violence often suffer repeated problems from the same person for months even years and not successfully resolved such incidents can eventually result serious injury death Indeed study conducted Kansas City indicates that percent spouse slaying there had been least one prior police call regarding wife beating and percent such murders police had been called least times course part the problem that arrests are seldom made such calls although recent research shows that arrests coupled with support for the victim may reduce repeated beatings The tragic murder John Lennon and the assassination attempt President Reagan renewed the cry for stricter waiting periods Ironically Lennon murder purchased his gun Hawaii state requiring permits purchase registration and banning the called Saturday Night Special almost six weeks before committing the crime And President Reagan assailant John Hinckley could have legally purchased firearms under waiting period scheme ACCEPTABLE SPORTSMEN Already strict gun laws are placed the nation million law obedient firearms owners under the Gun Control Act GCA which requires licensing manufactures importers and dealers prohibits almost all interstate transfers handguns and requires interstate transfers rifles and shotguns through licensed dealers and compliance with the laws the states where the dealers operates and where the buyer resides and even prohibits relatives from giving firearms family members living different states prohibits the sale arms ammunition dealer anyone else the acquisition transportation felons persons under felony indictment fugitives drug addicts mental incompetents illegal aliens dishonorably discharged veterans those who have renounced their citizenship and employees all such persons requires licensees keep records available for BATF inspection prohibits receipt possession guns convicts dishonorably discharged veterans illegal aliens the insane persons who have renounced their citizenship and prohibits the importation many firearms and parts from abroad Yet these laws have failed reduce crime which much higher than when the GCA took effect The solution according gun control fanatics impose even more restrictive laws the law abiding current proposal would have the federal government ask local authorities run background checks seven days with all the costs borne local departments with the added risk federal prosecution the local police retained the application their files and with standards for approval denial and provision for appeal addition Handgun Control Inc has promised sue any municipality police fail prevent transfer because they did not conduct through enough background investigation and the handgun was then used crime Handgun Control Inc has claimed have won least one such case the Philadelphia area where there waiting period and police conduct background checks Clearly restrictive gun laws only penalize the nation law abiding firearms owners for the violent acts committed small number criminals who commit disproportionately large number crimes And regrettably gun control any form diverts and wastes scarce resources which could instead used support genuine crime control measures The only effect waiting period deny someone the ability defend himself herself San Leandro California female single parent was forced endure days terror the hands maniacal neighbor while she awaited the completion the background check The day after she was allowed pick her handgun she killed her attacker with Statistically waiting period would seem more likely interfere with the estimated citizens who use handguns for protection each year than the roughly criminals who repeatedly misuse handguns generally acquired theft from fences drug dealers and the black market Yet the Wright Rossi study found that three quarters the convicted felons were able get their most recent handgun within day despite long criminal records the Wall Street Journal noted shortly after the Lennon murder the sudden hue and cry for more gun control such times kind cop out the sort cop out that part the crime problem America The country knows there something wrong Too many are turning crimes violence The notion that this can changed controlling guns worry may excuse for avoiding the hard work making our decrepit criminal justice system start function and the even harder work buttressing what used called the nations moral fiber SENTENCE THE CRIMINAL clear that the way curb violent crime punish the criminal Studies suggest that percent urban violence perpetrated career criminals and percent robbery and murder committed persons some form conditional release bail probation suspended sentence combat crime America must address this problem recidivism

Amendment dicta United States Verdugo Urquidez Verdugo Urquidez was citizen and resident Mexico and drug dealer The Mexican police arrested him Mexico and brought him the where the cops arrested him With the permission the Mexican police the narcs searched his residence Mexico and found documentary evidence detailing drug shipments the Verdugo Urquidez moved for suppression that evidence violation the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures The question for the court Does the Fourth Amendment apply non resident non citizens outside the The answer The court reasoning The Fourth Amendment protects the right the people secure against unreasonable searches and seizures Who are the people According Chief Justice Rehnquist the phrase the people was term art used the Framers Rehnquist wrote The Second Amendment protects the right the people keep and bear Arms and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain rights and powers are retained and reserved the people See also Const Amdt Congress shall make law abridging the right the people peaceably assemble Art The House Representatives shall composed Members chosen every second Year the People the several States emphasis added While this textual exegesis means conclusive suggests that the people protected the Fourth Amendment and the First and Second Amendments and whom rights and powers are reserved the Ninth and Tenth Amendments refers class persons who are part national community who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country considered part that community Since Verdugo Urquidez not part the people not protected the Fourth Amendments nor apparently the First Second Ninth Tenth The Supreme Court therefore views the words the people the Second Amendment have the same meaning the First Fourth Ninth and Tenth Amendments the people really meant the right states maintain militia suggested Sultan then would left with the absurd notion that only the states have the right peaceably assemble only the states have the right secure their persons and property etc The Supreme Court position indisputable the Second Amendment protects the individual right bear arms Also instructive the Report the Subcommittee the Constitution the Committee the Judiciary United States Senate Congress Second Session February The conclusion thus inescapable that the history concept and wording the second amendment the Constitution the United States well its interpretation every major commentator and court the first half century after its ratification indicates that what protected individual right private citizen own and carry firearms peaceful manner This hardly supports Sultan premise that individual right universally unaccepted Anti gunners frequently use the big lie technique referred Malbuff the effect that the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the Second Amendment does not apply individual citizens only protects the right the National Guard duck hunting Here nutshell history Supreme Court rulings the Second Amendment United States Miller Miller was very bad dude charged with laundry list heinous crimes They threw the book him including carrying sawed off shotgun violation the National Firearms Act When his case came before the Supreme Court Miller had skipped was fugitive lawyer appeared argue his side the case only the government lawyers showed Some fair trial huh Now the Second Amendment only protected the state militia the case would have been easy All the court would have had was say that Miller could not own gun because was not member the militia end discussion But they didn say that Why not effect they conceded that the Second Amendment protects individual right but still said that was constitutional for the government prohibit sawed off shotguns Their reasoning Certainly not within judicial notice that this weapon any part the ordinary military equipment that its use could contribute the common defense There are three interesting things about the court statement First course was not their notice nobody was present bring their notice Second had knowledgeable advocate been present would have brought the court notice that short barrelled shotguns have long been used ordinary military equipment from Revolutionary War blunderbusses luparas the Spanish American War trench cleaners The War End All Wars Subsequently troops used sawed off shotguns World War and tunnel rats used them Vietnam Third and most important that the court seems saying that the Second Amendment only protects the right individual citizens have ordinary military equipment Very interesting What are semi automatic assault rifles not ordinary military equipment When California assault rifle ban reaches the Supreme Court Miller will present real problem for the anti gunners There are other Supreme Court cases the Century but there are dozens state cases that support the individual right bear weapons not sporting goods See for example State Swanton Ariz App term arms used means such arms are recognized civilized warfare State Kessler terms arms most likely would include only the modern day equivalents the weapons used colonial militiamen also State rel City Princeton Buckner Barnett State App State Delgado City Lakewood Pillow Colo City Las Vegas Moberg App and dozens more There were few any gun control laws the books until after the Civil War Then suddenly every Southern state had law prohibiting newly freed slaves from owning guns Guess why was getting damned dangerous for the Klansmen lynch blacks The Fourteenth Amendment rendered those Black Codes unconstitutional the Southerners figured out some backdoor methods One was banning cheap guns the term Saturday Night Special has its origin the racial slur Niggertown Saturday Night which was similar Father Day Harlem Chinese Fire Drill Another was permit system waiting period background check requiring approval the sheriff who usually just happened Klansman United States Cruikshank Louisiana hundred good old boys got word that there were some uppity niggers having organizational meeting try protect themselves against constant attacks white gangs The good old boys got together and crashed the party They took away the Negroes guns and then proceeded murder them They were charged with conspiring deprive their victims their constitutional rights assemble and bear arms The court ruled that the First and Second Amendments did not apply the states the Fourteenth Amendment only prohibited the State from depriving the people their rights and the good old boys were not agents the State and the controlling Enforcement Acts protected only those rights granted the Constitution The court said that the rights assemble and bear arms were fundamental rights They were not granted the Constitution but were inalienable they were rights with which the victims were endowed their Creator Therefore the rights were not protected the Enforcement Acts and the KKK boys literally got away with murder This case proudly cited people who call themselves liberals instead the racist scum that they really are Presser Illinois Presser had organized society German immigrants Lehr und Wehr Verein who believed that regular military drill was important part good citizenship Four hundred them paraded through downtown Chicago carrying rifles Presser was charged with parading without license and organizing and maintaining private army claimed that the Illinois statutes violated his rights under the First Amendment freedom assembly and the Second Amendment right bear arms The court ruled that the Bill Rights applied only the federal government not the States and that any State could prohibit free speech free exercise religion assembly bearing arms etc Presser the Court never mentioned the individual right bear arms the case dealt only with armed organization Miller Texas Texas had law forbidding the carrying weapons and authorizing arrest without warrant for any violation Miller claimed this violated the Second Amendment and the Fourth Amendment The Court again ruled that the restrictions this amendments operate only upon the Federal power But they admitted that was possible that the Fourteenth Amendment might cause the Bill Rights apply the States well However Miller did not raise his objection early enough the Fourteenth Amendment limited the power the States such rights think was fatal this claim that was not set the trial court Subsequent Cruikshank Presser and Miller Texas the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment does fact cause the Bill Rights apply the States effect those three cases have been invalidated believe otherwise believe that the States can restrict religion speech and assembly execute unreasonable searches and seizures deny jury trials infringe the right bear arms important note the Court never doubted for instant that the right bear arms was not individual right which the Federal government could not infringe These cases never talked about the Second Amendment being right States organize militias has always been assumed that the right bear arms right individual citizens bear arms Perhaps the Supreme Court most infamous decision was Dred Scott Sandford How Chief Justice Taney said that Negroes could not citizens because they were they would have the right vote assemble speak political subjects travel freely and keep and carry arms wherever they went Taney the classic racist found that prospect inconceivable noteworthy though that the Supreme Court considered the right carry guns wherever they individual right every citizen along with voting speaking assembling Nor can Congress deny the people the right keep and bear arms nor the right trial jury nor compel anyone witness against himself Obviously the people refers all citizens not the states militia the rest the sentence becomes meaningless See Verdugo Urquidez supra What the Second Amendment protects individual right bear military weapons not for hunting not for target shooting not for repelling foreign invaders but for the purpose preventing oppression the people their own government The

prove once and for all that the Second Amendment does not protect individual right etc nauseam per Sultan his great embarrassment hence the title found overwhelming evidence the contrary had the academic integrity admit for which deserves great admiration does not like gun ownership any more than some people like flag burning organized religion but recognizes that the individual right exists whether one likes not RKBA Are firearms leading cause death children Version last changed DESCRIPTION some recent and lurid accounts the media the claim has been advanced that the leading cause death among children firearms Some variations this claim state that the leading cause death young black males Well this just does not sound right turning factual sources hampered not having information that date like However rather than wait have decided post the information have which terms completeness based data have checked data which only gives death counts per capita basis without segragation age groups However there are significant changes the per capita ratios which very strong indication that the figures can rationally extrapolated later information available will update this posting children ages under died children died from all accidents children died motor accidents children died drowning children died from fires and burns children died from miscellaneous other causes children died from firearms children died from ACCIDENTS involving firearms children ages and under were murdered firearms additional children ages through were murdered firearms The breakdown homicides group year groups and the group spans what clearly child age and and ages that are not children SUMMARY the deaths children Current incomplete statistics show that the percentages are still the same CONCLUSION Firearms are clearly NOT any stretch the imagination leading cause death for children ages and under facts firearms are involved both homicide and accidents ONLY deaths children DEATHS AGE MAJOR CAUSES TOT TOT Source for above NSC MURDER AGE GROUP WEAPON Uniform Crimes MURDER WEAPON unknown Total Source UCR THE HEAT THE MOMENTBy James Wright Bob and Jim are good drinking buddies After night their favorite bar they head back Jim trailer for some whiskey Jim begins praising his new girlfriend Bob questions her fidelity and claims that has slept with her Seized uncontrollable rage Jim grabs loaded from the kitchen drawer and ends the conversation with bang This the sort scenario that most people probably imagine when they hear that the majority murders involve individuals who knew each other before the crime Based this impression gun control advocates argue that most homicides not involve murderous intent Rather they are committed the heat the moment disputes altercations among loved ones close associates that escalate into rage disputes that turn fatal not much because anyone intended kill but because that lamentable fit anger gun was hand And that really how most murders happen follows that fewer guns were hand fewer murders would committed But the data relationships between homicide victims and their killers tell different story The conclusion favor gun control simply does not follow from the evidence FBI figures for and reveal that murders strangers for example the course robbery are rare They account for only about one eight homicides percent But this does not imply that the remaining seven every eight homicides involve loved ones slaying one another After all very few people love everyone they meet Just how close the relationship between victim and killer the typical murder many cases nearly third the total the authorities simply cannot determine the relationship Next unknown the largest relationship category acquaintance accounting for approximately one additional third the murders You might think that acquaintance refers fairly close associates but the FBI tallies neighbors friends boyfriends girlfriends and all types relatives their own separate categories there were any degree intimacy closeness between acquaintances the FBI would almost certainly classify the homicide under another heading this context acquaintance means only that the victim and killer had some idea each other identities before the murder All categories relatives combined account for about one six murders percent average About half these are slayings spouses spouses Friends and neighbors add average percent the homicide total Altogether then relatives friends and neighbors commit only about quarter percent murders not true that most murders involve persons who share some degree intimacy closeness Most murders some three quarters them are committed casual acquaintances percent perfect strangers percent persons unknown percent Gun control advocates however can easily convey the opposite impression these data simply omitting the unknown relationships from the calculation and including casual acquaintances within the category intimates they can make seem every murder other than those perfect strangers involve intimates But given what the category acquaintance specifically omits this would irresponsible misrepresentation That most murder victims know their killers prior the crime scarcely surprise That people know one another not itself evidence that they like one another Ordinarily the only people murderer would have good reasons kill would people she knows Indeed slayings the course some other felony are the only obvious exception random killings are understandably quite rare contrary the common assumption some degree prior acquaintance between victim and offender definitely does not rule out murderous intent Cases family members slaying one another figure prominently the gun control debate but represent fewer than one sixth all murders Studies family homicide have shown that most these families about percent them have had previous domestic quarrels serious enough bring the police the residence nearly half the cases the police had been called the residence five more times before the killing occurred Indeed most the families which such homicides occur have histories abuse and violence going back years even decades These slayings are generally not isolated outbursts rage between normally placid and loving couples They are instead the culminating episodes long violent abusive family relations least some family homicides probably result from the stereotypical moment rage Others result from thoroughly willful intention kill Knowing only that victim and killer are related blood marriage does not itself tell which explanation correct for given homicide Consider the bizarre case Theron and Leila Morris Florida couple recently accused killing their son Christopher Police say the Morrises were plotting with their son murder his wife for her insurance money Then the conspirators learned that the wife insurance policy had lapsed there was nothing gained killing her Evidently annoyed this turn events the Morrises then allegedly plotted between themselves kill Christopher order collect HIS insurance policy which was still force and worth twice what his wife policy was worth The Associated Press reported that the parents were also angry with Morris because had sold them bogus cocaine for that they had intended resell Morris killing will appear the FBI Uniform Crime Report tabulation family homicide having been slain his own parents will included the category son What then will know about the circumstances his death given that was the child his killers Nothing all How many murders are committed moment rage brought fruition largely because gun was available and how many result from unambiguous intention kill The fact nobody knows the answer this question adequate answer would require getting inside the heads murders they contemplate and commit their crimes Clearly though the assumption that heat the moment murders far outnumber willful murders cannot justified evidence prior victim offender relationships Such information does not support conclusions about homicidal motives about the number slayings that might prevented fewer guns were available Date Wed Sep PDT Gun

study reported the Annals the American Academy Political Science May found that most felons and other ineligibles who obtain guns not because the state screening system fails discern their criminal record but rather because these people find ways circumventing the screening system entirely Justice Department study showed that the primary means gun acquisition felons theft University Massachusetts study found that most criminals get their guns from other criminals States with waiting periods not have lower crime rates waiting period has ever been shown have any effect crime whatsoever Since banning handguns the homicide rate the District Columbia has risen possibly the highest rate ever for large American city The gun related homicide rate for the district has risen over while falling nationally and regionally Since the Canadian firearms control act was brought the number assaults with firearms Toronto has quadrupled Only homicides Canada involve firearms and about those involved illegal firearms million Canadians Canadian households contained firearm Approximately firearms are imported into Canada each year July Canadians owned handgun November the rate was FBI reports show that all firearms used crimes are obtained illegally the USA the number children under killed result firearm accidents the home approximately per year comparison over children drown every year back yard swimming pools Record breaking murder rates Washington New York City and Detroit are often given examples the need for handgun control when fact handguns are already strictly regulated these cities practically banned New York for example you must obtain permit from the Police Department before you can take your handgun out your home and even then you may only twice one year even just for target practice shooting range New York City enacted strict firearms ownership regulations but has seen increase the homicide rate and increase the gun related crime rate There evidence whatsoever showing that restriction handgun ownership related any way violent crime rates the fact there appears direct relationship between strictness gun laws and the rate violent crime some communities where extremely permissive gun laws grant permits carry practically for the asking violent crime rates have plummeted drastically Portland Oregon CCW Carry Concealed Weapon permits were issued CCW permits were issued the murder rate Portland DROPPED Orlando Florida series brutal rapes swept the community Citizens reacted the tripling the rate rape over the previous year buying handguns for self defense firearms were being purchased each week from dealers and unknown number more from private parties The newspaper there the Orlando Sentinel Star had anti gun editorial stance and tried pressure the local police chief and city government stop the flow arms When that tactic failed the paper decided that the interest public safety they would sponsor gun training seminar conjunction with the local police Plans were made for one day training course local city park Plans were made for expected women However more than women arrived and brought with them every conceivable kind firearm They had park many blocks away and the weapons were carried purses paper bags boxes briefcases holsters and womens hands One police officer present said never been scared his life Swamped the organizers hastily dismissed the women with promises for more thorough course with scheduled appointments The course offered was for three classes week and within months the Orlando police had trained more than women basic pistol marksmanship and the law self defense The results there were rapes Orlando triple the rate there were Before the training rape rates had been increasing Orlando nationwide Five years after the training rape was still below pre training levels Orlando but the surrounding areas for Florida overall and nationally Also violent assault and burglary decreased Orlando addition the rape reductions NOT SINGLE WOMAN HAD FIRED HER WEAPON self defense NOT SINGLE WOMAN HAD TURNED HER GUN HER HUSBAND BOYFRIEND data are available for later years The reason the program worked spectacularly well that was widely known that Orlando women had the means and training defend themselves from attackers Rapists being somewhat human they are learning engines they took their business elsewhere the detriment the defenseless those other locations Florida since the gun laws have been modified allow women who qualify carry gun concealed the reported rape rate has DROPPED Switzerland country with assault weapon and ammunition almost every home yet there very little crime Japan has total ban civilian firearm ownership yet Sept Oct Okinawa prefecture there were shootings resulting the deaths several police officers reported November Japan Today CBC Newsworld recent study the found that individual was much more likely victim violent crime area with strict gun control laws than area with lax gun laws Last year about murders were committed the United States About these were committed with handguns This country with people including gun owners Assuming that each the was committed different person they represent approximately the gun owners that country law enforcement statistics show that firearms were used private citizens self defence deter prevent stop crime approximately times This resulted justifiable killings and non fatal legally permissible woundings The remaining involved neither killings nor woundings but rather warning shots fired guns pointed referred Crime Control through the Private Use Armed Force Professor Gary Kleck Feb Social Problems Department Justice victim studies show that overall when rape attempted the completion rate But when woman defends herself with gun the completion rate drops Overall victimization studies show that for all violent crimes including assault rape and robbery the safest course for the victim resist with firearm The second safest course passive compliance with the attacker but this tactic approximately doubles the probability death injury for the victim All other tactics mace whistles hand hand combat screams and forth have even worse outcomes Florida State University study indicates that law abiding citizens use handguns approximately times year self protection with additional self defense uses rifles and shotguns For thousands the possession and use firearm the difference between being the victim violent crime and successfully thwarting criminal attack The concept cooling off period has basis fact Kansas City study showed that domestic violence cases police had been called the scene several times before Police Foundation study showed that only all handguns traced crimes

does not exist company called KTW developed teflon tipped bullet for penetrating car doors but when fired into standard Kevlar body armour was even less effective than ordinary bullets contrary the claims fanatical anti gun lobbyists who trumpeted that this new bullet rendered cops helpless even with body armour police officer the USA has been ever shot with armour piercing handgun ammunition KTW was setup the early police Sergeant Don Ward police Lieutenant Turcus and scientist Paul Kopsch They sold their KTW round the military and handful police departments and have never sold the public The NRA helped draft the final legislation which was adopted which banned the sale the KTW armor piercing bullet anyone but police and military organizations The ORIGINAL legislation which the NRA opposed would have banned any ammunition which could pierce ballistic vest That includes the smallest caliber which can slip between the fibers the kevlar vest also includes most rifle ammunition but very little handgun ammunition short the legislation proposed would have banned most calibers including ones like Winchester and which have been used since the turn the century for hunting Plastic guns that are invisible airport ray machines not exist The only pistol the market today with any plastic parts the Glock and approximately metal weight and the high strength polymer frame contains barium similar pistol made Ramline but only calibre The NRA helped draft bill which bans guns which can pass airport security Mind you such guns exist the gun which caused all the controversy the Glock contains large amount metal and there metal polymer the plastic portions which shows ray machine The Glock very reliable and has become the standard sidearm for large number law enforcement agencies across the country including memory serves Washington and parts New York One the main proponents the original legislation Senator Metzenbaum revealed his true opinion When pressed exclaimed

according the BATF the years since NONE these weapons has been used their legal owner criminal offence There are approximately legally owned fully automatic weapons Assault rifles machine guns submachine guns Canada yet since NONE these weapons has been used their legal owner criminal offence paper presented the Royal Society Palmer described the theory operation used modern machine guns both recoil and gas operated Puckle was granted patent automatic weapon Multiple barrel weapons which Palmer and Puckle weren were developed centuries earlier Some these earlier guns also used rather clever way getting multiple shots from the same barrel without reloading Revolvers had also been invented the and the Brits actually used semi autos against the colonials Bolt action and lever action rifles are convertible fully automatic weapons the turn the century John Browning first machine gun was converted from lever action rifle During World War One the factory Canada converted the Ross bolt action rifle into the Huot machine gun During World War Two New Zealand Lee Enfield bolt action rifles were converted into the Charlton light machine gun the state Florida faced with increasing pressure condemn assault weapons assembled commission study the evidence and then issue report the governor and legislature The panel comprised lawmakers citizens representatives from both pro and anti gun groups and law enforcement officials spent several months examining data supplied both state and federal law enforcement agencies The group also heard testimony from Florida police officers who work within some the region worst criminal battle zones Early this spring the commission announced the results their labors with the findings mirroring similar studies conducted the Bureau Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms BATF summary the commission concluded that based police reports actual testimony and statistics provided federal agencies the use assault weapons criminals constituted only fraction percent types firearms employed felonious activity The commission discovered that media hype and anti gun advertising had created sinister ambience around these firearms without actually clarifying what the guns were The term assault weapon generally defined military weapon capable both semiautomatic and fully automatic fire Written testimony supplied the commission indicated that fully automatic firearms were rarely ever used criminals fact there was evidence that licensed fully automatic firearm has ever been instrumental reported crime The panel found that the term assault weapon portrayed the media referred semiautomatics general especially guns resembling military style combat firearms The resulting confusion made reporting police officials difficult best the commission determined result they called for clarified reporting system that would indicate the type make caliber and action any firearm used crime Even with the confusion actual data available still indicated that use semi autos criminals was negligible This supported BATF findings nationwide that semiautomatic firearms were not times more likely used crime and were not the weapon choice drug dealers These assumptions have been advanced anti gun organizations have formed the basis discriminatory newspaper study and have often been echoed media commentators The Florida report concert with federal studies also found that stolen guns rather than over the counter purchases were most often employed criminals Some anti gun groups insist that Florida gun shops are doing brisk trade supplying assault weapons drug gangs The commission found evidence support this accusation conclusion the commission could not uncover any reason place restrictions upon the sale semiautomatic firearms and determined that these guns posed particular menace law enforcement Instead they called for harsh mandatory sentences for the criminal misuse firearms end plea bargaining firearms related crimes better reporting procedures naming firearms used crimes and improved database prohibit point purchase sales and the issue carry permits individuals with history mental incompetency New Jersey just enacted the most harsh assault weapon ban the country Owning gun now felony possession assault weapon According the bill gun capable causing injury and often holds more than pellets None the weapons banned had been used criminal offence New Jersey the previous years But contrary what the media reported the police didn want the favor The law enforcement community generally thought that Gov James Florio went off the deep end making the assault weapon ban his top priority The New Jersey Chiefs Police voted against the bill The Fraternal Order Police testified against the bill the state Legislature The Police Benevolent Association was persuaded abstain the issue after Florio threatened rescind police benefits package that had recently been agreed Washington there are number police lobbies that support assault weapon bans though narrower than the New Jersey one Yet not clear that the lobbyists have the working police solidly behind them Last year the National Association Chiefs Police conducted poll command rank officers percent thought law abiding citizens ought have the right purchase any type firearms percent opposed federally mandated waiting period similar study officers the street found that about opposed gun bans and supported public ownership firearms Yet Handgun Control claim have the active support every major police organization for its gun prohibitions and waiting periods dishonest The National Sheriffs Association the American Federation Police and the National Association Chiefs Police have refused board the Handgun Control train There one group police that generally does back more gun control big city police chiefs and the organizations they run Their voice certainly deserves heard but too often the voices other officers are silenced For example San Jose Calif Police Chief Joseph McNamara raises funds for Handgun Control official city stationary and claims represent the views every law enforcement officer But when rank and file San Jose officer Leroy Pile spoke out against gun control his own time the chief had him suspended and tried fire him Maryland during the election pro gun police officers were forbidden speak out against gun control proposal that was the ballot Maryland gun control proponents including Gov William Donald Schaefer then claimed fighting for the law enforcement community Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates has denounced semi autos which asserted that their massive use criminals their excessive power their use drive shootings and their easy convertibility full auto Chief Gates now facing calls for his resignation result the video taped beating black man several white officers the same time the LAPD ballistics expert produced evidence that such firearms accounted for about percent crime guns were difficult not impossible most cases convert and were almost never converted and that drive shootings rarely involved more than three five rounds California recently passed assault weapon ban The firearms banned included several non existent firearms well single shot shotgun Most the firearms banned were not capable full auto fire and thus were not assault weapons Approximately these firearms are legal hands California The state then required all current owners these weapons register them Dec but only printed fraction the registration forms required and most gun owners were not able get the required forms result only firearms were registered time and another late registration These late registrations were then turned over state Justice Department for legal action against those people who tried obey the law Leading studies from the Justice Department indicate that criminals fear meeting armed victim more than they fear running from the police fact more than third the felons surveyed admitted having been scared off shot wounded captured armed victim Morever almost the felons surveyed admitted there was least one time when they decided not commit crime for fear that the victim was armed From the Reuters News Service May Headline Police Officials Say Citizens Should Take Arms Police chiefs see the breakdown the justice system the main cause crime and believe citizens should learn how handle weapon according survey released Wednesday poll taken for the National Association Chiefs Police surveyed heads more than law enforcement agencies and found that percent think citizens should take training self defense with firearms protect their homes and property The poll showed that percent believe the criminal justice system has broken down the point that inability prosecute and imprison criminals the major cause crime and percent said that courts are too soft criminals general Nearly percent believed their own departments are understaffed and three out four said that they cannot provide the same level service decade ago the survey said The association non profit organization that operates the American Police Hall Fame and Museum Miami Positive Externalities Gun Ownershipby John Kell While friend and were talking about gun control remarked that didn matter him restrictions were placed gun ownership because didn own gun What failed realize was the benefits from civilian gun ownership whether owns guns not benefits because the ownership guns civilians has positive externalities Externatilities are unpaid for effects that accrue third parties from the use property its owners The effect may beneficial harmful the third parties beneficial the effects are known positive externalities harmful they are called negative externalities For example someone who walks down residential street full well landscaped yards might emjoy the sight and smell flowers bloom Though the individual homeowners paid for and cared for their particular yards the walker also benefits The pleasure the walker receives positive externality the homeowners yard care Advocates gun control are quick point out that innocent third parties are sometimes injured killed accidental discharge criminal misuse firearms Indeed these are negative externalities guns civilian hands What advocates gun control rarely acknowlege even understand are the positive externalities civilian gun ownership Positive externalities may less newsworthy but they are just real and far outweigh the negative externalities the right bear arms While accidents and criminal use guns are reported news making the negative externalities gun ownership readily apparent the millions peaceful interactions among people that occur each day are not reported These peaceful events are taken for granted and little thought given what conditions brought them about the first place Millions awake each morning and find that their homes haven been burglarized The vast majority stores pass through day and night without being robbed Many women walk alone live alone without being accosted raped These peaceful happenings are due many factors such burglar alarms door locks and police patrols but many are due part civilian gun ownership One million times each year homeowners and storekeepers protect their property and lives using firearms often this occurs without shot being fired The mere sight gun often enough send robber running Impressive this number doesn show the full extent which the crime rate lowered due privately owned guns those cases where gun owner thwarts lawbreaker obvious that having gun benefited its owner But those cases benefit non owners well the lawbreaker killed will commit crimes the lawbreaker wounded captured even escapes his inclination commit similar crime the future probably lessened The peace that arises from the disinclination inability commit another crime positive externality gun ownership Crime Kept Check cannot known how many times each day potential burglars think not going break into that house might get shot Even though difficult evaluate how much crime kept check civilian gun ownership there evidence that suggests its damping effect substantial Orlando the numbers burglaries and rapes fell substantially after women went through well publicized training program the use handguns survey taken felons percent stated that the fact that victim might armed had caused themn avoid particular homes people There probably way determine how many law abiding citizens might turn crime were less dangerous occupation friend mine gentle and honest man once confided that had stolen car when was teenager and three friends had been walking down the street the small town where lived noticed car with keys the ignition hopped and drove away Their joyride ended when they were pulled over the local constable friend said his act thievery hurt his mother more than anything else ever did and regretted often was guilty theft and knew but said wished that the car owner hadn left the keys Even though well equipped criminal can break into locked car less than minute leaving cars unlocked with keys the ignition greatly increases the number thefts The lesson here that very convenient commit crime more people will commit This not say that everyone dishonest just basic law human nature that people will choose the easy way over the hard way when confronted with task the task living easier take than make Frederic Bastiat said the very nature man impels him satisfy his desires with the least possible pain Copyright laws are violated daily otherwise honest people with access photocopiers and tape recorders The crime convenient and the victim distant most people who commit copyright violations probably wouldn consider themselves criminals Bastiat said When then does the plunder stop stops when becomes more painful and more dangerous than labor Gun ownership civilians makes burglary and robbery very dangerous and often very painful About one half all homes the United States contain firearms Someone considering carrying out burglary has way determining the house plans enter has guns avoids all occupied houses benefiting those who don own guns well People who don own guns know implicitly that they benefit from private gun ownership How many them would put sign their yard that says The owners this house will not defend with armed force Jails are full repeat offenders That evidence that punishment not strong enough deterrent for some people The punishment served the criminal justice system usually occurs long after the crime further attenuating any deterrence value may have But negative reinforcement the condition provided armed homeowner the time attempted crime effective deterrent Such immediate and life threatening action makes crime hazardous occupation and crime made dangerous way life the number criminals will decline and society will safer place for all Restraining Government Another positive externality even less apparent the restraint that has been put government action because civilian gun ownership What policies might have been put place federal state and local governments had civilian gun ownership been heavily restricted the many years since the founding our nation what rules might bureaucrats have written they hadn needed worry about armed revolt the masses What invasive policies might they have come with make enforcement their laws easier There are thousands laws the United States that restrict gun ownership one way another Restrictions include waiting periods bans concealed weapons and bans owning particular kinds weapons such handguns military style semi automatics Gun control advocates support these laws because they hope eradicate negative externalities but reducing gun ownership eliminates positive externalities well fact gun control laws probably cancel more positive than negative externalities because law abiding citizens are much more likely obey the rules than are criminals The negative externalities guns need decreased but the best way minimize them deal with them directly Accidents can reduced educating owners about proper care and handling firearms Such training being provided nonprofit groups including the National Rifle Association and for profit shooting ranges Criminal misuse firearms can best decreased cutting the overall crime rate Methods reducing crime have been discussed other authors and include drug legalization eliminating barriers entry the work force and increasing educational opportunities Since don pay for positive externalities seldom think their value Indeed would formidable task measure the total value the positive externalities guns private hands However even without that measurement the knowledge the existence positive externalities should help understand why many people consider the right own firearms priceless freedom Gary Kleck Crime Control Through the Private Use Armed Force Social

useless for self defense their owners are more likely kill relatives than assailants they tempt the law abiding violence False false and false DON KATES PATRICIA TERRELL HARRIS ADVOCATES gun control generally represent the debate one between cool rational defenders civil order and ignorant rednecks inspired half acknowledged prejudices fact social science research increasingly the side the rednecks And the arguments for banning guns are mostly myths Myth Most murderers are ordinary law abiding citizens who kill relative acquaintance moment anger only because gun available fact every study homicide shows the overwhelming majority murderers are career criminals people with lifelong histories violence sometimes irrational sometimes acquisitive The typical murderer has prior criminal history averaging least six years with four major felony arrests also likely substance abuser with record traffic and gun accidents Indeed even people who accidentally kill with guns tend have similar felony records and histories substance abuse and auto accidents short these are aberrant people characterized consistent indifference human life including their own Our present laws acknowledge this banning gun ownership felons juveniles and the mentally impaired These restrictions fail not because they are too narrow but because they are inadequately enforced Myth The public supports gun control Fifty per cent American householders have guns and per cent all Americans say national surveys that they would use gun for self defense Americans support prudent controls access guns felons but groups advocating gun control want much broader prohibitions For example Handgun Control Inc HCI which claims support only moderate controls considers moderate the gun control laws Washington That city has effectively outlawed self defense with guns prohibits handgun sales and allows hunters have rifles and shotguns only kept unloaded and disassembled While Americans support gun registration opinion polls abstract endorsement becomes fanatical opposition when HCI and even more extreme supporters registration avow are forced admit that only first step toward their goal confiscation HCI backed proposals ban handgun sales and confiscate all handguns were rejected even two the most liberal states California and Massachusetts Myth Gun owners are ignorant rednecks given senseless violence Studies consistently show that the average gun owners are better educated and have more prestigious jobs than non owners judge their applications for permits carry guns all times the following are were gun owners Eleanor Roosevelt Joan Rivers Dianne Feinstein Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Sid Caesar John Lindsay Robert Goulet Leland DuPont Arthur Godfrey Michael Korda Henry Cabot Lodge Sammy Davis Lyman Bloomingdale Donald Trump John Foster Dulles and John Laurance David Winthrop and Nelson Rockefeller early academic analysis still relied upon gun control advocates that labeled gun owners Violence prone turns out have been based survey questions that addressed only willingness come the aid crime victims other words the analyst confused good citizenship with violence Later surveys show that gun owners are less likely than non owners approve police brutality violence against dissenters etc Myth Protection against crime the job the police Slogans like protect and serve contribute the false impression that the main function the police protect individuals But the has only five hundred thousand police officers dividing that number three shifts per day and adjusting for vacation leave desk duty etc leaves only about police patrol any one time protect million Americans Their numbers are wholly inadequate provide individual protection everyone Myth The Second Amendment protects only the states right arm militia This interpretation appeared only the twentieth century Significantly the two earliest commentaries the Second Amendment which were before Congress when passed the Bill Rights described guaranteeing the people their right keep and bear their private arms Tinch Coxe and their own arms Sam Adams emphasis added The Founders were well aware Aristotle dictum that free governments rest free men armed while basic tyranny mistrust the people hence they deprive them arms James Madison author the Second Amendment The advantage that the Americans have over every other nation that they are armed The Founders put today NRA mossbacks shame One loves possess arms Thomas Jefferson wrote George Washington June another occasion Jefferson wrote his year old nephew Games played with the ball and others that nature are too violent for the body and stamp character the mind But the gun gives boldness enterprise and independence the mind Let your gun therefore the companion your walks Myth Guns are not useful for self defense Advocates gun control have been certain this that they have paid for several national surveys prove Awkwardly every study has shown the opposite handguns are used more often repelling crimes than committing them While handguns are used about crimes yearly they are used repel about crimes related argument that handguns kill six even times many household members burglars This comparison deceptive several grounds First about half shootings one spouse the other are defensive killings homicidal husbands victimized wives misleadingly characterizes many cases which guns save innocent lives gun murders Also focusing homes the statistic excludes the numerous instances which shopkeepers kill robbers When the number shopkeepers and abused wives who shoot criminals counted the figure for defensive killings increases about per cent HCI harps fatal accidents and murders the home without mentioning that the former are generally perpetrated irresponsible aberrants and the latter overwhelmingly Disarming the more than per cent gun owners who are law abiding and responsible will not disarm the per cent aberrants Even did lack handguns would not prevent the killing wives and children with other weapons like the knife the far deadlier shotgun Perhaps the most disingenuous ploy downplay suicides which constitute the majority household handgun deaths the comparison Even agree that stopping suicide legitimate use state power silly argue that banning single method would have significant effect The most obvious alternative the long gun used roughly per cent current gun suicides Myth Resistance with gun will get you injured killed According gun controllers armed women frequently have their guns taken away and used against them And HCI advises submission The best way keep you alive put defense give them what they want run National victim data suggest otherwise While victims resisting with knives clubs bare hands are about twice likely injured those who submit though far less likely raped robbed victims who resist with gun are only half likely injured those who take HCI advice emphasize that gun does not make resistance safe regardless circumstances Perhaps person with the foresight own gun more likely have pondered advance the question when and how resist Myth Other countries have reduced violence banning guns This claim cannot true since low European violence long preceded gun restriction Restrictive gun laws were largely pioneered not Europe but various high violence American states beginning the late The measures failed violence rates continued rise and they were largely repealed after World War European gun bans began about the same time ours were being repealed Moreover they were response not ordinary crime which was low but the political crime and unrest the era Even gun control failed curb ordinary violence this country the European countries that banned guns response political crime have nevertheless suffered far more such crime than has America Ironically the only gun control place when English crime fell from its appalling late eighteenth century high its idyllic early twentieth century low was that the police could not carry guns The inevitable conclusion that the determinants violence are socioeconomic and cultural factors rather than the availability any particular deadly instrument Moreover the emphasis changing gun laws fundamentally diversionary With prosecutors judges and prisons swamped murderers rapists robbers etc the violence prone know they risk very little real penalty for illegal possession gun the premier criminological study gun control enforcement Bendis and Balkin conclude very possible that gun laws potentially reduce gun related

STATISTICS MORTAL RISKS Preston Covey Erik Larson even handed article Paxton Quigley Armed Force WSJ cites the world most notorious statistic regarding guns the home pioneering study residential gunshot deaths King County Washington found that gun the home was times more likely used kill its owner spouse friend child than kill intruder The times stat everywhere these days has grown media lore like the proverbial urban myth was inflated one pugilistic talk show pundit Given the shock value the finding the conclusion the New England Journal Medicine NEJM study remarkably understated The advisability keeping firearms the home for protection must questioned Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits bringing firearm into their home But what need know this What exactly are the risks and benefits The NEJM testimony neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks Further with motor vehicles want know What control have over the risks and benefits And with the risks cancer heart disease auto accidents How can minimize the risks Like raw highway death tolls the NEJM stat not very helpful here The NEJM finding purports inform but framed warn off widely promulgated the media scare stat misleading half truth whose very formulation calculated prejudice and terrify The frightful statistic screams for itself The risks far outweigh the benefits yes What fool would run these risks your car were times more likely kill you loved one dear friend innocent child than get you your destination should you not take the bus Uncritical citation puts the good name statistics the bad company lies and damned lies Surely can better where lives are stake Let take closer look this risky business The times stat the NEJM study the product dividing the number home intruders aggressors justifiably killed self defense the divisor into the number family members acquaintances killed gun the home the dividend The divisor this risk equation the study five year sample there were intruders and other cases self defense The dividend the study there were accidental deaths criminal homicides and suicides divided yields There were total gun related deaths King County between and the study leaves deaths outside homes unaccounted The NEJM notorious times statistic seriously misleading six counts The dividend misleadingly characterized the media the acquaintances the study who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members equated friends The implication that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members dear friends and innocent children Deaths may all equally tragic but the character and circumstance both victims and killers are relevant the risk These crucial risk factors are masked the calculated impression that the death toll generated witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors This criminological hogwash The study itself does not distinguish households environs populated people with violent criminal substance abuse histories where the risk death very high versus households inhabited more civil folk for example people who avoid high risk activities like drug dealing gang banging and wife beating where the risk very low indeed actuality negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents and homicides are perpetrated mostly people with histories violence abuse people who are identifiably and certifiably high risk for misadventure ignore these obvious risk factors firearm accidents and homicides misleading ignoring the role alcohol vehicular deaths tautology neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms vehicles but the person and circumstance the gun owner driver crucially affect the risk One misleading implication the way the NEJM stat framed that the mere presence gun the home much more likely kill than protect and this obscures indeed disregards the role personal responsibility The typical quotation this study unlike Larson attributes fatal agency the gun gun the home times likely kill The Center Prevent Handgun Violence major promulgator the NEJM statistic uses this particular formulation can dispense with the silly debate about whether people guns that accomplish the killing again tautology gun deaths would not occur without the guns The question begged how many deaths would occur anyway without the guns any case people are the death dealing agents the guns are their lethal instruments The moral core the personal risk factors gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents human choice mediates homicide and suicide gun otherwise The choice own gun need not condemn person NEJM high risk pool The gun does not create this risk itself People have lot say about what risk they run with guns their homes For example graduates Paxton Quigley personal protection course not run the touted times risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks causing suffering vehicular death reckless drunk drivers Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role personal responsibility and choice just they disregard and obscure the role socio economic criminological and other risk relevant factors firearm related death This why resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities Fortunately nothing can consign the NEJM risk pool but our own lack choice responsibility the matter Suicide accounts for the deaths gun the home the NEJM study against the total deaths gun King County including those outside the home house suicides are the total death toll which closer the roughly proportion found other studies Suicide social problem very different order from homicide accidents The implication the NEJM study that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns true that attempted suicide gun likely succeed not obviously true that the absence gun would prevent any all these suicides This widely assumed alleged but the preponderance research guns and suicide actually shows otherwise that this wishful thinking all but few truly impulsive cases See Bruce Danto The Human Side Homicide Columbia University Press Charles Rich Guns and Suicide American Journal Psychiatry March suicides were removed from the dividend the NEJM study risk equation the times stat would deflate six The inclusion suicides the NEJM risk equation like the causes durability interdiction suicidal intent itself profoundly debatable matter Quotations the NEJM study totally disregard this issue Citations the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate justifiable and excusable homicide Most measures like the NEJM homicide rate are based the immediate disposition cases But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self defense the literature battered women immediate case dispositions are notorious for under representing the rate justifiable excusable homicide Time January cover story women Fighting Back reported one study finding that women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out Time July cover story week gun deaths reported the domestic cases shootings abuse victims but only the homicides were reported self defense May update Time reported that the homicides had eventually been ruled self defense Time sample the originally reported rate self defense was error factor four The possibility such error not acknowledged promulgators the NEJM statistic While both the dividend and the product the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated the divisor unconscionably misleading The divisor this equation counts only aggressors who are killed not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed even shot The utility armed self defense the other side the coin from the harms done with guns homes What kind moral idiocy measure this utility only terms killings measure the utility our police solely terms felons killed opposed the many many more who are otherwise foiled apprehended deterred Should not celebrate let alone count those cases where human life lost successful armed defenses The question posed media that cite the NEJM scare stat this Why neglect the compendious research successful armed defense notably criminologist Gary Kleck Point Blank Guns and Violence America Aldine Gruyter Kleck estimations the rate and risk defensive firearm use are based victimization surveys well other studies the rate high about one million year and the risk good gun defenders fare better than anyone either those who resort other forms resistance those who not resist Dividing one million gun defenses year annual gun deaths from self defense homicides suicides and accidents yields Thus can construct much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat gun times more likely used defend against assault other crime than kill anybody course Kleck critics belittle the dividend this calculation what good news for gun defenders bad news for gun control should indeed question the basis and method Kleck high estimation defensive firearm use have questioned the NEJM statistic Clearly the issue how manage mortal risks not settled uncritical citation statistics One thing troubles still can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat our media but hardly ever find Kleck good work mentioned even critically You might point out that the time the amendment was written militia understood all able bodied white males per the Militia Act something You did not have part regular military Militia Act include all free white males between and Annals Congress Congress around page unit was just the case that should the need arise for common defense all the men would take their guns and come running You might look the Militia Act Also point out the reasoning from the Federalist Papers regarding armed citizenry being necessary prevent the govt from getting any funny ideas about implimenting despotism sure there were plenty Germans the who didn like what Hitler was doing but without armed citizenry there not much they could about The following section from upcoming book may some value got more goodies but have brought those work yet FOR THE DEFENSE THEMSELVES AND THE STATE LEGAL CASE STUDIES THE AMENDMENT THE CONSTITUTION Clayton Cramer Wakefield Hollowbrook Pub ISBN Who Are The Militia For contemporary definition militia can look the Virginia constitution ratification convention GEORGE MASON Chairman worthy member has asked who are the militia they not the people this country and are not protected from the fate the Germans Prussians our representation ask Who are the militia They consist now the whole people except few public officers But cannot say who will the militia the future day that paper the table gets alteration the militia the future day may not consist all classes high and low and rich and poor but they may confined the lower and middle classes the people granting exclusion the higher classes the people should ever see that day the most ignominious punishments and heavy fines may expected Under the present government all ranks people are subject militia duty Under such full and equal representation ours there can ignominious punishment inflicted Earlier during the Virginia debates Mason had warned instance within the memory some this house will show how our militia may destroyed Forty years ago when the resolution enslaving America was formed artful man who was governor Pennsylvania disarm the people that was the best and most effectual way enslave them but that they should not openly but weaken them and let them sink gradually totally disusing and neglecting the militia Francis Corbin arguing for the Constitution held that the concerns about standing armies were overstated The honorable gentleman then urges objection respecting the militia who tells will made the instrument tyranny deprive our liberty Your militia says will fight against you Who are the militia Are not militia Shall fight ourselves sir the idea absurd are also terrified the dread standing army cannot denied that ought have the means defence and able repel attack The following exchange the Virginia ratifying convention demonstrates that militia was recognized constituting the whole people CLAY wished informed why the Congress were have power provide for calling forth the militia put the laws the Union into execution MADISON supposed the reasons this power obvious that they would occur most gentlemen resistance should made the execution the laws said ought overcome This could done only two ways either regular forces the people one the other must unquestionably done insurrections should arise invasions should take place the people ought unquestionably employed suppress and repel them rather than standing army The best way these things was put the militia good and sure footing and enable the government make use their services when necessary GEORGE MASON Chairman unless there some restrictions the power calling forth the militia execute the laws the Union suppress insurrections and repel invasions may very easily see that will produce dreadful oppressions extremely unsafe without some alterations would use the militia very bad purpose any disturbance happened New Hampshire call them from Georgia This would harass the people much that they would agree abolish the use the militia and establish standing army Gov Randolph argued before the Virginia ratifying convention order provide for our defence and exclude the dangers standing army the general defence left those who are the objects defence left the militia who will suffer they become the instruments tyranny Alexander Contee Hanson member the Maryland State Convention also discussed the meaning militia his pamphlet support ratification the Constitution argued that the concerns about standing armies were excessive and that such standing armies were unavoidable concludes that the concerns are mere pretext for terrifying you and that may well material here remark that although well regulated militia has ever been considered the true defense free republic there are always honest purposes which are not answered militia they were the burthen the militia would great that free people would means willing sustain indeed possible the nature things that congress shall any future period alarm improper augmentation troops could not that case depend the militia which ourselves committee the Maryland ratifying convention proposed ratification the Constitution with list amendments one which relevant the Second Amendment Among these provisions That the militia shall not subject martial law except time war invasion rebellion explaining why this amendment was considered important the official journal the convention argued This provision restrain the powers Congress over the militia although means ample that provided Magna Charta and the other great fundamental and constitutional laws Great Britain being contrary Magna Charta punish freeman martial law time peace and murder execute him yet may prove inestimable check for all other provisions favor the rights men would vain and nugatory the power subjecting all men able bear arms martial law any moment should remain vested Congress The ratifying convention refused the full list proposed amendments response the committee requested the convention ratify the Constitution with what considered the most important three amendments The committee explained further its concern The first these objections concerning the militia they considered essential for march beyond the limits neighboring state the general militia which consists many poor people that can illy spared from their families and domestic concerns power Congress who could know nothing their circumstances without consent their own legislature executive ought restrained The militia then was the same the adult freemen Maryland Tench Coxe Pennsylvania was member the Annapolis Convention and Continental Congress His letters were among the first appear favor ratification the Constitution and were widely reprinted newspapers the day Coxe admitted The apprehensions the people have been excited perhaps persons with good intentions about the powers the new government raise army After stating that the Constitution contained adequate restrictions the funding and control standing armies Coxe argued that The militia who are fact the effective part the people large will render many troops quite unnecessary They will form powerful check upon the regular troops and will generally sufficient over awe them for our detached situation will seldom give occasion raise army though few scattered companies may often necessary Richard Henry Lee was appointed the Constitutional Convention but declined serve His pamphlet against ratification the Constitution were one the most popular the time His concerns about standing armies and the national government authority regulate state militias provide both insights into the importance private arms restraining national power and the identity the people the militia discussing the danger that Congress might not represent the interests the common people the levying taxes and raising standing armies Lee admits true the yeomanry the country possess the lands the weight property possess arms and are too strong body men openly offended and therefore urged they will take care themselves that men who shall govern will not dare pay any disrespect their opinions But recognizing that slow change frequently capable lulling the population sleep way that radical change will not easily perceived that they have their proper negative upon passing laws congress the passage laws relative taxes and armies they may twenty thirty years means imperceptible them totally deprived that boasted weight and strength This may done great measure congress disposed modelling the militia Should one fifth one eighth part the men capable bearing arms made select militia has been proposed and those the young and ardent part the community possessed but little property and all the others put upon plan that will render them importance the former will answer all the purposes army while the latter will defenceless Further evidence the identity the militia the people and not just small part the population can found James Madison Federalist Madison sought alleviate concerns about Federal power that end pointed out that The only refuge left for those who prophecy the downfall the State Governments the visionary supposition that the Federal Government may previously accumulate military force for the projects ambition Madison asserts the political unlikeliness such event but Extravagant the supposition let however made Let regular army fully equal the resources the country formed and let entirely the devotion the Federal Government still would not going too far say that the State Governments with the people their side would able repel the danger The highest number which according the best computation standing army can carried any country does not exceed one hundredth part the whole number souls one twenty fifth part the number able bear arms This proportion would not yield the United States army more than twenty five thirty thousand men these would opposed militia amounting near half million citizens with arms their hands officered men chosen from among themselves fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted governments possessing their affections and confidence may well doubted whether militia thus circumstanced could ever conquered such proportion regular troops This clear statement that the militia was not small professional military but the entire male population the country with arms their hands There other contemporaneous evidence that the Founding Fathers considered the militia equivalent not the people least very large part the people The Militia Act declared the militia the United States include almost every free adult male the United States These persons were obligated possess firearm and minimum supply ammunition and military equipment This statute incidentally remained effect into the early years the present century legal requirement gun ownership for most the population the United States The same Congress that debated the Bill Rights also debated the Militia Bill which became the Second Congress the Militia Act Its language clearly shows That the militia the United States shall consist each and every free able bodied male citizen the respective States resident therein who are shall the age eighteen years and under the age forty five years except hereinafter excepted who shall severally and respectively enrolled the captain commanding officer the company within whose bounds such citizens shall reside That every citizen enrolled and notified shall within month thereafter provide himself with good musket firelock bore not smaller than seventeen balls the pound sufficient bayonet and belt pouch with box therein contain not less than twenty four cartridges suited the bore his musket firelock each cartridge contain proper quantity powder and ball two spare flints and knapsack and shall appear armed accoutred and provided when called out exercise into service herein after directed Look this Annals Congress Debate the Militia Bill December involved discussion whether the Congress should define what persons would exempted from militia duty the state legislatures should part that debate Rep Williamson observed When departed from the straight line duty marked out for the first principles the social compact found ourselves involved difficulty The burden the militia duty lies equally upon all persons and when contemplate departure from this principle making exemptions involves our present embarrassment emphasis added Rep Randolph arguing for reduction the standing army January emphasized that standing armies were not only useless and enormous expense but contrary the spirit the Constitution people who mean continue free must prepared meet danger person not rely upon the fallacious protection mercenary armies Current law still recognizes this organic relationship between the people and the militia Militia composition and classes The militia the United States consists all able bodied males least years age and except provided section title under years age who are who have made declaration intent become citizens the United States and female citizens the United States who are commissioned officers the National Guard The classes the militia are the organized militia which consists the National Guard and the Naval Militia and the unorganized militia which consists the members the militia who are not members the National Guard the Naval Militia Indeed the current National Guard was organized under Congress power raise and support armies and not under the organizing arming and disciplining the Militia provision since the militia can called forth only execute the laws the Union suppress insurrections and repel invasions More recently the Supreme Court Verdugo Urquidez explicitly recognized that the people referred the Second Amendment has the same meaning does the rest the Bill Rights Contrary the suggestion amici curiae that the Framers used this phrase simply avoid awkward rhetorical redundancy the people seems have been term art employed select parts the Constitution The Preamble declares that the Constitution ordained and established the People the United States The Second Amendment protects the right the people keep and bear Arms and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain rights and powers are retained and reserved the people See also Const Amdt Congress shall make law abridging the right the people peaceably assemble Art The House Representatives shall composed Members chosen every second Year the People the several States emphasis added While this textual exegesis means conclusive suggests that the people protected the Fourth Amendment and the First and Second Amendments and whom rights and powers are reserved the Ninth and Tenth Amendments refers class persons who are part national community who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country considered part that community Federalists and Antifederalists debating the Constitution state ratifying conventions the Militia Act current federal and state

Winter issue Policy Review magizine your campus library should have More complete information Gary Kleck book Point Blank Kleck lifelong liberal Democrat and former supporter waiting periods gives thorough statistical analysis became well known right keep and bear arms circles for his study Crime Control Through the Private Use Armed Force published the socialogical journal Social Problems volume Kleck used data from various surveys and from official Department Justice statistics estimate the frequency with which crime stopped armed citizens The most comprehensive survey looked was conducted Democratic polling firm Peter Hart and Assoc behalf the pro gun control National Association Against Violence Kleck used the data from among other places the Hart poll estimate that hand guns are used stop crime average times per year Moreover all guns hand guns rifles shotguns combined are used stop roughly million crimes per year use the number though most control efforts are directed toward hand guns and people make idle claims like concealable weapons are only useful for committing crimes Initially one might compare this with the frequence violent crime which gun was used From the Bureau Justice Statistics National Crime Survey you will find that there were total violent crimes committed with hand gun and violent crimes committed with any gun during Thus either way see more civilian defenses with hand guns and guns general than crimes committed with hand gun with any gun This comparison course has its limits For one thing don know how gun control would affect the frequency defenses and crimes For some insight consider the National Institute Justice study James Wright and Peter Rossi Before doing this and related NIJ study sociologist Wright was record favoring stricter controls Rossi credentials are certainly legitimate has served president the American Sociological Association Wright and Rossi interviewed convicted felons state correctional systems and found that the presence and scope gun control laws had effect criminals ability obtain firearms course convicted felons cannot after release legally obtain gun they lose this right along with the right vote and various others and can only have these restored they sue and judge finds their favor stricter controls could not placed convicts seeing they not allowed possess firearm anyway Wright and Rossi found that criminals convicted gun related crime did not expect have any difficulty obtaining firearm the day after release from prison Moreover convicted gun predators said that they somehow could stopped from stealing gun buying through legal surrogate getting one the black market borrowing gun etc they would switch long guns sawed off long guns these are more lethal than hand guns long guns being used more crimes would likely increase the rates fatalities Kleck book cited above does probit regression analysis regression where what the researcher wants predict the probability event occurs estimate the likelihood attack takes place during crime that injury occurs given attack and that death results given injury order judge whether the offender possessing firearm makes victim death more likely found that overall the lack available hand guns would drop deaths however this points out ignores that the unavailability firearms would reduce the number crimes foiled armed citizens Moreover the handguns were replaced long guns Kleck estimates imply that the number deaths due violent crime would increase What affect would the gun control have crimes foiled armed citizens experiment was tried Orlando Florida from Oct Mar which the Orlando Police Department trained over women use hand guns Details the study are Alan Krug The relationship between firearms ownership and crime rates Congressional Record follow study was published Kleck and Bourda Law and Politics Quarterly vol The highlights uninterrupted time series Orlando crime trends shows that the rape rate dropped from the level far greater decrease than for any previous year The rape rate was constant the rest Florida and the The only other crime drop substantially was burglary Thus the targeted crime and the one most likely occur where victims have access guns dropped Pro gun control forces frequently cite one several New England Journal Medicine studies claiming that the chances being killed with firearm are anywhere from times higher than those killing burglar among gun owners The number includes gun suicides reputable study has shown that decreasing gun availability has any affect the suicide rate does affect the gun suicide rate but other suicide rates increase Moreover below all civilian defenses the offender actually killed hence even the number were the accurate ratio would have multiplied roughly compensate for the fact that only considers burglars killed not crimes stopped This alone would suggest that owning firearm quite useful for personal defense but there more None the New England Journal Medicine studies restricted attention injuries due one own firearm Thus criminals are harder disarm than the law abiding reasonable assumption one believes that criminals don obey laws incorrect compare rate killing burglar with firearm with rate being killed burglar with his the point the studies was assess whether gun useful for home defense should compare the likelihood being injured with firearm versus that stopping injury using firearm Also the New England Jornal Medicine studies did not include any firearm defenses against any crime other than robbery contrast they all counted against firearms any homicides committed any setting yes One more thing FBI data suggest that the ratio self defense homicides criminal homicides Detroit and Dade Miami conties roughly one takes this national average argument that the cities are geographically distinct but had similar numbers one gets estimate roughly civilian legal defensive homicides per year with gun and with some other weapon based National Crime and Health Statistics versus reported police legal intervention gun homicides and police legal intervention nongun homicides the way one the New England Journal Medicine studies Kellerman and Reay gives ratio for Seattle for suggesting even higher number criminals killed self defense armed citizens compared with the number killed police What about other crimes The Bureau Justice Statistics National Crime Survey for gives the following numbers completion robberies when the victim used various methods self protection Method completed attacked injured gun knife other weapon physical force called reasoned offender evasion compliance defending oneself against robber with gun reduced the chance injury over using nongun weapon other than knife the next best option Compared with compliance one chance avoiding injury defending with gun was better The margin error for these numbers extremely low the case with the fewest realizations was defense with knife and even for that there were cases covered Thus these numbers are significant with high level confidence one likes The National Crime Survey gives similar numbers for assaults though those are even more dramatic One who defended oneself against assault with gun had chance being attacked and chance being injured The next best choice for avoiding injury was reasoning with the offendor which led chance attack and chance injury Using another weapon nongun non knife led attack rate and injury rate Knives led attack rate and injury rate Compliance led attack rate the lowest except for defense with gun and injury rate One other topic likely come and you should careful how you reply Not long ago within the past years there was study believe the New England Journal Medicine Journal the American Medical Assoc which compared the homicide rates Seattle with those Vancouver and claimed that the lower rates Vancouver were evidence for success Canadian gun control Two problems The study did not adjust for demographics Seattle has large disaffected Hispanic community whose homicide rate considerably higher than that for the rest Seattle When adjustment made for this and for the demographic composition Vancouver the homicide rates become very close think Seattle actually becomes lower This point that though valid would hesitate make would easy for critic misconstrue That while one would maintain that ethnicity causes homicide one might argue that ethnic strife often associated with higher homicide rates Nevertheless dishonest opponent would try depict one who raised this point bigot Hence offer point Canada homicide rate has increased since its radical gun control law was passed and has climbed more rapidly than the rate one compares the ratio homicides Vancouver and Seattle prior one gets memory serves much more dramatic disparity than the post control study that often cited Therefore seems unlikely that the disparity due the Canadian gun control law Someone might try make other international comparisons Japan and England are favorites the pro control forces The comparisons are worthless First you could always counter with information comparisons with Israel and Switzerland high gun ownership low crime Mexico low gun ownership high crime Second you might point out that differences crime rates are attributable our revolving door justice London reported robberies end conviction New York City fewer than Moreover England has twice many firearms homicides annually did before adopted its tough anti gun laws One way make some corrected comparisons with Japan adjusting for judicial system cultural differences etc might compare homicide rates among Japanese Americans who have widespread access guns because they live here but maintain much their Japanese culture Through the FBI tracked homicide arrests race and included category for Japanese Applying the fraction Japanese American arrests the total number homicides during Kleck Point Blank estimates homicide rate for Japanese Americans per persons contrast the homicide rate Japan for the same period was per times higher Some notes about Britain Though the British have much lower gun homicide rate than have they also have much lower knife homicide rate and lower rate homicide using hands and feet Are infer then that the British ahve fewer knives hands and feet than Americans the way the leading study English gun control was done Colin Greenwood Firearms Control Study Armed Crime and Firearms Control England and Wales London Routledge Greenwood compiled tables gun crime rates and gun ownership rates all English police force areas found that the rate armed crime way connected with the density firearms the community Indeed anything the reverse appears true Kleck analyzes Greenwood data and finds that the legal gun owner rate had correlation with both offenses involving firearms general and robberies involving firearms Moreover the differences cannot attributed higher concentration firearms rural areas alone What the subcommittee the Constitution uncovered was clear and long lost proof that the Second Amendment our Constitution was intended
