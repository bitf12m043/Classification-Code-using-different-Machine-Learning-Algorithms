covering natural language understanding discourse knowledge representation common sense reasoning and planning These areas research are combined the TRAINS project long term effort directed with Len Schubert The TRAINS system intelligent planning assistant that can converse spoken natural language with person create discuss and evaluate various plans involving freight shipments train particular Allen research breaks down into two main subareas broadly classified research discourse and research plan reasoning The research discourse focused two person extended dialogs which the speakers have specific tasks accomplish emphasis this work the representation and use the context the dialog solve problems semantic interpretations and the recognition the intentions underlying the speakers utterances Work this area has included developing the first computational model speech acts the development multi level plan based analysis involving discourse level plans well domain level plans and the development several different discourse plan recognition algorithms addition are exploring how prosody and intonation signals discourse intentions and how this interacts with the plan based dialog model While important for work formally well defined and understood equally important that computational theories can lead effective implementations result considerable amount effort has also been made developing expressive hybrid knowledge representation system that can support complex reasoning about plans and actions The research plan reasoning draws much its motivation from the dialog work particular the representation plans must support wide range different forms reasoning plan construction traditional planning plan recognition plan evaluation and the communication plans between agents Much our work this area has focused the representation time and action and have reformulated the planning problem problem temporal reasoning Within this framework have developed representation plans that temporally explicit and supports plan construction recognition and communication are also exploring methods temporal reasoning that are viable even with large data sets temporal information Key
