University Texas Austin Computer Science UCLA Applied Mathematics Helsinki University Technology Research Interests The research group concentrates modeling cognitive processes with artificial neural networks Current work includes models language acquisition episodic memory self organization the visual cortex and schema based vision are also working evolving neural networks with genetic algorithms where the goal automatically discover sequential decision strategies for problem solving and robotics For more details see the UTCS Neural Networks Research Group home page ClassesSpring Artificial

State University and and degrees from the University Illinois and respectively worked the Computer Engineering Department Goodyear Aerospace Corporation later Loral Defense Systems Division now Lockheed Martin Tactical Defense Systems Division for years where developed the architectures two SIMD parallel processors the STARAN and the MPP joined the faculty Kent State University the author several technical papers and has patents discovered two parallel sorting algorithms the odd even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort also discovered method scrambling data random access memory allow accesses along multiple dimensions these memories were used the STARAN and the MPP Batcher was awarded the Eckert Mauchly Award from the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society for the pioneering
