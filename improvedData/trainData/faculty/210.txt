NOTICE PROJECT DEADLINE EXTENDED Nov Nov regular deadline now Nov Solution mid term exam Chapters Sections from the two books covered the midterm Tariq Masood home page for COP will contain list frequently asked questions about projects and other course related information Previous semeester exams and final with solutions Note that diagrams are missing hand drawn Please see the solutions reserve Marston Sci Library for the diagrams Project due OCTOBER note the extension Project assign October due November Minix User Guide for COP README file how obtain Minix changes User Guide above ftp accessible directory containing the Minix distribution careful downloading the files this directory using Netscape They are binary files and should downloaded using ftp binary mode copy the Minix root directory Scan through this see the source code for Minix without having boot Minix itself you have CISE account then davis Minix MinixRoot see the same thing allows you grep the source code see the MinixRoot README file for more information Most the stuff the usr subdirectory The rest currently empty Technical Reports and lists abstracts own technical reports and related reports students and colleagues CIS technical reports still under construction Web aware sparse matrix collection maintain large collection sparse test matrices Each matrix has its own web page with statistical information the matrices and small picture the nonzero pattern Click here for sparse matrices and patterns Also available via ftp Other useful collections sparse matrices include the Harwell Boeing collection and the SPARSKIT collection sparse matrices Our web site gives you static pictures sparse matrices the advantage being that you don have download the whole matrix dynamic viewer assuming that you have the matrix can give more information The Emily package one such example The Approximate Minimum Degree ordering algorithm AMD Now released Jan AMD will appear Release the Harwell Subroutine Library Related AMD variants not AMD itself however are available for non commercial use NETLIB and via anonymous ftp this site Take look technical report lists for more information click here for set transparencies from talk given the International Linear Algebra Year Direct Methods Workshop September hosted CERFACS Toulouse France click here for one page abstract the talk For papers related the talk see approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm and combined unifrontal multifrontal method for unsymmetric sparse matrices UMFPACK package for solving sparse linear systems Version now released Sept Version Beta also released Dec See Davis and Duff combined unifrontal multifrontal method for unsymmetric sparse matrices Submitted ACM Transactions Mathematical Software for more information The Unsymmetric pattern MultiFrontal Package UMFPACK Version solves the linear system using factorization where general unsymmetric sparse matrix The method relies dense matrix kernels the BLAS also see below factorize rectangular frontal matrices which are dense submatrices the sparse matrix being factorized result obtains high performance RISC based workstations and vector supercomputers The package includes Users Guide and both double and single precision versions requires the BLAS and two subroutines from the Harwell code and available from NETLIB UMFPACK freely available for research purposes For commercial use UMFPACK Version will soon appear placed the Harwell Subroutine Library UMFPACK written ANSI Fortran Beta release UMFPACK Version now available only ftp not NETLIB The primary difference with Version that COMPLEX and COMPLEX versions are included UMFPACK Version you use the Beta release please let know whether not you encounter any bugs submit the final release Version once the Beta release tested real application test suite complex matrices rather limited Note that the complex versions will not appear the next release the Harwell Subroutine Library for which January the target date This work collaboration with Iain Duff Group Leader the Numerical Analysis Group the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory England and The European Centre for Research and Advanced Training Scientific Computation CERFACS UMFPACK Version also NETLIB UMFPACK Versions and are longer available nor supported Click here for list related technical reports The BLAS Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms The Fortran BLAS NETLIB model implementation For best performance UMFPACK you should use vendor optimized BLAS Alternatively excellent optimized BLAS for RISC workstations available from Michel Dayde Iain Duff Antoine Petitet and Abderrahim Qrichi Aniba experiments Sparc Model this optimized BLAS four times faster than the non optimized BLAS available NETLIB You can get the most recent version via anonymous ftp ENSEEIHT France However since the trans Atlantic link can slow placed copy with the authors permission this Univ Florida site Note that the copy might not the most recent although will try keep date Click here for more information about the optimized BLAS FLOODS FLOOPS Florida Object Oriented Device Process Simulators UMFPACK has been incorporated the primary sparse factorization code the FLOODS and FLOOPS packages for semiconductor device and process simulation The two packages are written Mark Law the VLSI TCAD Group the
