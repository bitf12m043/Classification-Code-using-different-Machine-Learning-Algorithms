interested agents multiagent systems distributed problem solving distributed artificial intelligence negotiation coalition formation electronic commerce resource bounded reasoning normative methods for system design machine learning combinatorial optimization scheduling primary interests lie inherently distributed combinatorial problems resource and task allocation and scheduling among agents with different levels autonomy representing different real world enterprises that are seeking synergies limited cooperation Such settings occur for example production scheduling multi enterprise agile manufacturing negotiations with real world subcontractors vehicle routing among dispatch centers different companies meeting scheduling classroom scheduling etc studying different commitment strategies and protocols multiagent systems and the possibility carrying out contracts without external enforcement have studied the role marginal costs basis for negotiation and questions bounded rationality and deliberation scheduling when the exact computation marginal costs intractable have also analyzed the effect asynchrony and message congestion among negotiators and greater domain risk tolerance enhance the negotiation process computationally currently studying the usefulness distributed versions variety combinatorial optimization algorithms from the and communities Some other research issues that currently addressing are using machine learning techniques alternate between different negotiation strategies based dynamic properties the environment cost based constraint relaxation anticipation future contracts agent negotiation strategy fair line profit division schemes among agents and contracts involving multiple agents opposed just two Lately have also developed normative theory coalitions among bounded rational agents secondary interest machine learning the theoretical side lately coauthored paper that disproved justification for biasing decision tree induction algorithms towards generating trees with few leaves have also coauthored empirical paper that studied the applicability learning multiagent settings the applied side currently cooperation with domain experts who actually need the solution comparing number symbolic induction methods and neural network algorithms enhance classification accuracy real world biological problem Specifically

lieutenant obligatory military service Finnish Airforce Academy Work ExperienceResearch Assistant for Prof Victor Lesser Fall present University Massachusetts Amherst Department Computer Science Developed normative theory coalitions among self interested agents whose rationality bounded computational complexity Extended the contract net framework towards working among self interested agents whose rationality limited computational complexity Explored the advantages different modes commitment and the use marginal costs negotiation among intelligent agents Invented method that enables autonomous computational agents carry out exchanges without enforcement Participated the design and development distributed scheduling system for airport ground resource management Discovered new
