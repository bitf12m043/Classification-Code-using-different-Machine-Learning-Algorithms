Computer architecture Parallel computing Memory systems Performance evaluation Research Summary research targets the memory systems shared memory multiprocessors and high performance uniprocessors Memory system design important because largely determines computer sustained performance work emphasizes quantitative analysis often requiring new evaluation techniques system level not just hardware performance Much recent work part the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel Projectwith Profs Larus and Wood and many students The project expects most future massively parallel computers will built from workstation like nodes and programmed high level parallel languages like HPF that support shared address space which processes uniformly reference data Our research seeks develop consensus about the middle level interface below languages and compilers and above system software and hardware have recently proposed the Tempest interface that enables programmers compilers and program libraries implement and use message passing transparent shared memory and hybrid combinations the two are developing Tempest implementations Thinking Machines cluster workstations COW and hypothetical hardware platforms The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel project named because use our tools cull the design space parallel supercomputers manner similar how aeronautical engineers use conventional wind tunnels design airplanes Other recent work with Madhu Talluri targets improving translation lookaside buffer TLB and page table performance clustering aligned groups base pages Options require changes hardware only complete subblocked TLBs operating system only clustered page tables both superpages and partial subblocked TLBs See our ASPLOS and SOSP papers Sampler Recent Papers The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel Project Annotated
