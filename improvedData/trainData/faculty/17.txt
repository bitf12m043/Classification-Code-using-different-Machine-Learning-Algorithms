facilitates programming and compiling for parallel machines Currently students and are developing languages compilers and tools demonstrate and exploit the power user level coherence policies also interested performance evaluation tools that help programmers understand and improve their programs performance Recently Tom Ball and developed efficient path profiling algorithm which provides more detailed understanding control flow within routines and which has identified new possibilities for better compilers Last modified Fri Nov James Larus larus wisc edu
