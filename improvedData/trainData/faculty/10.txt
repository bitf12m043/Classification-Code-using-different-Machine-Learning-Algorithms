before escaped received Queens College and went work for the Naval Weapons laboratory civilian mathematician programmer met wife Elaine few months later and were married November went Illinois for more education received Masters degree math from Illinois assistantship was help two Germans Manfred Paul and Ruediger Wiehle write full Algol compiler for the IBM computer was fun figuring out how implement recursion efficiently before there were many papers the topic This ended wife and going Munich for almost three years received doctorate under Bauer and Joseph Stoer from MIT the Munich Institute Technology Germany June This was math numerical analysis since computer science theses were not yet kosher was assistant professor Computer Science Stanford from While Stanford our twins Paul and Susan were born What made more exciting than usual was that they were born the birthday myself and twin April when twin town Elaine makes four birthday cakes left Stanford because had weather moved Cornell which has weather and have been snowed ever since was Department Chair and became the William Lewis Professor Engineering had Guggenheim Fellowship Return table contentsI better known for text writing and contributions education than the wonderfulness research what you are good bloom where you are planted have received number awards for contributions education the IEEE Taylor Booth Award the ACM SIGCSE award Cornell Outstanding Educator Award the Clark Award from Cornell College Arts Sciences and the American Federation Information Processing Societies AFIPS education award proud all advisees but two stand out Susan Owicki thesis laid the foundation for proofs correctness parallel programs with the notion interference freeness paper authored the topic won the ACM Award for best paper programming langauges and systems And Raman thesis just won the ACM best dissertation award for Raman designed and implemented system for speaking any tex latex document including technical articles and books The same document can printed spoken Being able speak mathematics effective manner was important goal his work Reading for the Blind already using his system produce audio cassettes served Chair the Computing Research Association then the Computer Science Board the late when opened its office Washington and began seriously represent computing research interests also conducted the Taulbee Surveys the period and proud obtaining essentially complete responses from PhD granting computer science departments during that period other comparable survey has had such response rate One year required only telephone calls get the departments send their questionnaires received the Computing Research Association Service Award for this work the Surveys and for chairing the Association during its move toward respectability and responsibility currently editor for IPL Acta Informatica Formal Aspects Computing and Software Concepts and Tools This editing keeps busy but enjoy try take interest individual papers when know the area and will suggest substantial rewrites myself when believe will help Serve where you can best serve Fred Schneider and are editors Springer Verlag Texts and Monographs Computer Science What spare time used sports like golf softball volleyball swimming and table tennis Once China split pants playing ping pong hour later while giving lecture mentioned that the audience should not laugh when turned around and explained why The interpreter spoke and everyone laughed However don know whether told the truth just said Gries made joke laugh also used sing barbershop and Gilbert and Sullivan And working around the house carpentry wiring remodeling has taken lot time and yielded considerable satisfaction Return table contents MIME

database systems parallel database systems database benchmarking geographic information systems Research Summary two main research projects are SHORE and Paradise The objective SHORE design implement and evaluate persistent object system that will serve the needs wide variety target applications including hardware and software CAD systems persistent programming languages geographic information systems satellite data repositories and multimedia applications SHORE expands the basic capabilities the widely used Exodus Storage Manager developed Wisconsin funded ARPA number ways including support for typed objects multiple programming languages Unix like hierarchical name space for named objects and Unix compatible interface objects with text field This interface intended ease the transition applications from the Unix file system environment SHORE existing Unix tools such and will able store their data SHORE objects without modification basically Unix file becomes either single SHORE object the text field complex object SHORE being targeted wide range hardware environments scaling all the way from individual workstations heterogeneous client server networks large multiprocessors such the Intel Paragon SHORE joint project with Profs Carey Naughton and Solomon The Paradise project attempting apply the technology developed part the SHORE and Gamma projects Gamma parallel relational database system developed the University Wisconsin the task storing and manipulating geographic data sets Currently many geographic information systems GIS use relational database systems hold their data While such systems are excellent for managing business data they are poor match for the modeling needs GIS which must capable storing and manipulating much more complex objects such polygons and polylines Instead Paradise employs object oriented data model providing much better match the type needs GIS Another significant difference from current GIS systems that Paradise employs parallelism facilitate executing and processing large data sets such satellite images The target hardware platform for the project cluster Sparc connected with ATM Sample Recent Publications
