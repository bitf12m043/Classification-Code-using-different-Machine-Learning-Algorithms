This project involves extending ATM switches assist the provision end end reliable multicast which the amount work that must done senders and receivers essentially independent the size the multicast involves the addition several mechanisms ATM switches One mechanism provides redundant acknowledgement suppression that senders receive only single acknowledgement for every packet sent second mechanism allows multiple senders many many multicast send multi cell packets single virtual circuit without losing the ability properly demultiplex them the receiver This done using dynamic virtual circuit subchannel mechanism Details can found recently completed technical report and set slides Gigabit ATM Switching nearing completion set three chips and associated hardware and software that implements uniquely scalable and flexible ATM switch supporting link speeds from and capable supporting configurations with total throughputs from more than This system uses unique cell recycling technique for multicast switching which has optimal scaling properties allowing large switches implemented for fraction the cost competing architectures This work part major ARPA funded project gigabit network technology ATM Network Design Classical network design techniques are not well equipped cope with the design ATM networks which are characterized statistically unpredictable traffic and wide range different application types with diverse requirements including multicast Network design methods that allow network managers define traffic requirements fairly gross level and adopt worst case approach network design appear more appropriate See the following reports for recent results Distributed Control ATM Networks The design ATM switching hardware now fairly well understood However distributed control systems for effectively managing large scale networks with thousands millions terminals remain unavailable While number proposals have been put forward the ATM Forum there limited understanding how competing approaches compare with respect performance use network resources and even correctness are developing framework for precisely defining and analyzing network control systems that allows the essential issues separated from the welter protocol and implementation details that often make difficult make meaningful comparisons and using this framework develop precise characterizations new approaches distributed network control addition have designed and are implementing particular network control system details which can found Copies slides from recent presentation keynote talk for ATM workshop Georgetown University can found here Project Ideas Here list project ideas for graduate students They range difficulty from senior masters design project ideas through doctoral research Double speed port processor for gigabit ATM switch ATM congestion control mechanism using frame level discarding ATM switch support for reliable multicast communication Adaptive resequencing ATM switching system Selected Past Research ActivitiesQueueing Analysis Multistage Switching Networks Multistage switching networks are among the simplest and most cost effective architectures for large ATM switching systems This work developed new methods for analyzing queueing performance for these systems order improve accuracy and extend them handle shared buffer switch elements and alternative flow control strategies Nonblocking Multirate Switching This work extends the classical theory nonblocking networks apply switching systems supporting communication channels with different rates that can share the capacity both external links and internal switch data paths applies directly multirate circuit switching and ATM switching systems that use static routing obtained results generalizing classical results for both point point and multipoint switching systems Analysis Algorithms for Hard Combinatorial Problems This research centers methods for analyzing the performance algorithms for hard combinatorial problems are interested both worst case analysis and probabilistic analysis The probabilistic analyses make use problem specific probability
