dataflow analysis Research Summary work mainly involves the design and implementation language based programming tools that help programmers with problems like understanding how existing programs work and how they would affected proposed modifications understanding the textual structural and semantic differences between two versions program retesting program after changing combining pieces old programs produce new program with certain semantic guarantees This work has involved the use program representation called the program dependence graph PDG and operation called slicing also working new algorithms for precise interprocedural dataflow analysis Previous work interprocedural dataflow analysis mainly concentrated either efficient algorithms for specific individual problems not necessarily efficient algorithms for general class problems Thomas Reps Mooly Sagiv and have developed and implemented new algorithm that both efficient and applies large class problems Recent
