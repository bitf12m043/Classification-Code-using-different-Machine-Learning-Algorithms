joined the Department Computer Science January His research interests include operating systems parallel and distributed computing and multiprocessor computer architecture particular interest are scalable shared memory architecture designs both hardware and software Carter leading two ARPA sponsored research projects the Avalanche scalable multiprocessor architecture design effort and the Fast and Flexible Mach Based Systems effort aka Mach The development efficient and highly portable distributed shared memory system Quarks part this effort While graduate student Rice University designed implemented and evaluated Munin distributed shared memory system that allows shared memory parallel programs executed efficiently distributed memory multiprocessors has also worked high speed bulk data communication protocols For the Fall Quarter will teaching the Introduction Operating Systems course Meeting times are Tuesday Thursday from EMCB Current Research ProjectsAvalanche Scalable Multiprocessor Design The goal this project develop integrated cache memory and communication architecture that significantly reduces the latency both distributed shared memory and message passage multiprocessor communication The core processor Avalanche will the forthcoming RISC CPU are designing new Context Sensitive Cache Controller Unit that will support flexible suite cache coherence protocols for DSM applications and provide context sensitive injection incoming data into the appropriate level the memory hierarchy order minimize message latency Primary research collaborators Davis Ravindra Kuramkote and Chen Chi Kuo Other research collaborators Mark Swanson Leigh Stoller Benny Yih and Ashley Saulsbury Fast and Flexible Mach Based Systems The goal this project develop operating system that provides much higher degree flexibility than traditional operating systems and use that added flexibility circumvent the performance functionality tradeoffs that thwart traditional highly decomposed microkernel based operating systems Important components this work are module management service lightweight and decomposed Mach kernel functionality aggressive exploitation interprocess sharing and efficient distributed shared memory see below will maintain backward compatibility where practical and freely distribute unencumbered version the entire system Primary research collaborators Jay Lepreau Mike Hibler Jeff Law and Bryan Ford Quarks Distributed Shared Memory System The goal this project develop efficient portable and freely available distributed shared memory system support the shared memory programming style distributed memory multiprocessors and networks workstations Ideally Quarks will eventually for distributed shared memory what PVM did for message passing make relatively easy use pervasive ported wide array systems and reasonably efficient For more our motivation take look HOTOS position paper Alpha release Quarks currently available that runs SunOS SPARC machines but ports are progress BSD boxes RISC IRIX MIPS and the Mach operating system Primary research collaborators Dilip Khandekar and Linus Kamb Here copy the slides for OSDI tutorial distributed shared memory minus some the graphs which will incorporate soon Significant Past Research ProjectsMunin Distributed Shared Memory System Munin was the first software distributed shared memory system explore the potential performance benefits using relaxed consistency model Among Munin novel features were software implementation the release consistency model the first multiple writer memory consistency protocol address the problem false sharing support for multiple consistency protocols including user supplied protocols and update timeout mechanism reduce the communication overhead write update protocols For shared memory programs with moderate high degrees sharing Munin achieved far greater performance speedup than conventional distributed shared memory systems usually within hand coded message passing performance Many the features and ideas first developed Munin have appeared subsequent DSM systems Primary research collaborators Willy Zwaenepoel and John Bennett Here copy dissertation concerning Munin Optimistic Bulk Data Transfer Protocol The key insight exploited this effort was that when the first packet blast bulk data received node highly likely that packet outside the blast will arrive before the last bulk data packet received such upon receipt the first packet blast bulk data the network device layer should set things optimize this case This optimization which was independently observed Van Jacobson and incorporated into TCP resulted Mbps bulk data transfer rates between two SUN Mbps Ethernet the time the best TCP implementations achieved under Mbps bulk data transfer rates Primary research collaborators Willy Zwaenepoel Selected Publications Carter Bennett and Zwaenepoel Techniques for Reducing Consistency Related Communication
