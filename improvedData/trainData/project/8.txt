decades research the subject complementarity problems with its diverse applications engineering economics and sciences has become well established and fruitful discipline within mathematical programming Several monographs and surveys have documented the basic theory algorithms and applications complementarity problems and their role optimization theory This page serves center for information regarding research complementarity problems such there listing meetings interest the community some pointers software for complementarity problems well links other pages interest listing researchers and some application areas are also given Table Contents Directory Researchers Complementarity Software for Complementarity Problems Applications Complementarity Relevant Web Links Directory Complementarity ResearchersSoftware for Complementarity Problems MCPLIB collection nonlinear mixed complementarity problems problem description and how access the GAMS source files for these problems Complementarity Toolbox for MATLAB This evolving freely available toolbox consists several mex and files These allow all the MCPLIB problems accessed from MATLAB without access GAMS The mex files give function evaluations and sparse Jacobian evaluations Machine specific versions can downloaded The PATH solver also available this toolbox more details below Solver Interface GAMS This describes library routines that are available help hook your solver the GAMS MCP modeling language Contact steve gams com rutherford colorado edu ferris wisc edu for further details MILES MILES extension the classical Josephy Newton method for NCP which the solution each linearized subproblem computed via Lemke almost complementary pivot algorithm This Newton point used define the Newton direction which then used damped linesearch The merit function used measures both the violation feasibility and complementarity MILES also employs restart procedure cases where the Newton point cannot computed due termination secondary ray Every linearized subproblem rescaled equilibrate the elements appearing the data the subproblem PATH Runs under GAMS MCP directly under MATLAB The PATH solver applies techniques similar those used Newton methods for smooth systems nonsmooth reformulation the MCP The algorithm consists sequence major iterations each consisting approximation linearization step similar that MILES the construction path the Newton point the solution the approximation and possible search this path When the Newton point does not exists the path cannot entirely constructed
