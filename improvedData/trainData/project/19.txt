ObjectivesCurrent StatusMotivating ExampleSEQ Data Model Sequin Query LanguageOptimization TechniquesSEQ System DevelopmentPublicationsRelated WorkContact InformationProject Objectives number important database applications require the processing large amounts ordered sequence data The domains these applications include financial management historical analysis economic and social sciences metereology medical sciences and biological sciences Existing relational databases are inadequate this regard data collections are treated sets not sequences Consequently expressing sequence queries tedious and evaluating them inefficient Databases should model the data using the abstraction sequences allow data sequences queried declarative manner utilizing the ordered semantics take advantage the unique opportunities available for query optimization and evaluation integrate sequence data with relational data that users can store and query combination relation and sequences These requirements serve the goals the SEQ project Various kinds sequences need supported temporal sequences being the most important kind Queries should expressible using notions like next and previous which are natural when considering sequences These queries should optimized that they can evaluated efficiently These issues need studied theory and then database system needs built that demonstrates the feasibility the theoretical ideas Project Status The current status the project have defined the SEQ data model that can support most important kinds sequence data have also defined algebraic query operators that can composed form sequence queries analogous the composition relational algebra operators form relation queries have described how sequence queries can efficiently processed and have identified various optimization techniques use sequence query language Sequin that can declaratively express queries over sequences Sequin query can include embedded expressions relational query language like SQL vice versa are building disk based database system demonstrate the feasibility our proposals The system implements the SEQ model using nested complex object architecture built over the SHORE storage manager and can process several megabytes data Relations and sequences are supported integrated and extensible manner Motivating Example Sequence Query weather monitoring system records information about various meteorological phenomena There sequentiality the occurrence these phenomena the various meteorological events are sequenced the time which they are recorded scientist asks the query For which volcano eruptions did the most recent earthquake have strength greater than the Richter scale this query expressed relational query language like SQL complex features like groupby clauses correlated subqueries and aggregate functions are required Further conventional relational query optimizer would not find efficient query execution plan even given the knowledge that the Earthquakes and Volcano relations are sorted time However very efficient plan exists one models the data sequences ordered time The two sequences can scanned lock step similar sort merge join The most recent earthquake record scanned can stored temporary buffer Whenever volcano record processed the value the most recent earthquake record stored the buffer checked see its strength was greater than possibly generating answer This query can therefore processed with single scan the two sequences and using very little memory The key such optimization the sequentiality the data and the query Data Model The details the SEQ data model are described published paper click here for postscript version Here present the gist The basic model sequence set records mapped ordered domain positions This many many relationship between records and positions can viewed two dual but distinct ways set records mapped each position set positions mapped each record These two views are called Positional and Record Oriented respectively and each gives rise set query operators based that view Queries sequences could require operators either both flavors The Record Oriented operators are similar relational operators and include various kinds joins overlap containment etc and aggregates Such operators have been extensively explored researchers the temporal database community The Positional operators include Next Previous Offset Moving Aggregates etc Further operators allow zooming operations sequences means collapsing and expanding the ordering domains associated with the sequence For instance daily sequence could zoomed out collapsed weekly sequence zoomed expanded hourly sequence The last part the model deals with operations groups sets sequences The advantage that this makes easy model queries involving sequence collections which the case many real world situations All the sequence operators are extended work with groups similar sequences instead with single sequences This extension the SEQ model indicates that practical implementation SEQ would probably involve nested complex object system Sequin Query Language have devised query language called Sequin using which declarative sequence queries can specified The language similar flavor SQL except that the inputs queries well the results queries are sequences Click here for description the Sequin language with examples Optimization Techniques have proposed new optimization techniques for sequence queries involving Positional operators There are existing techniques that have been proposed for queries with Record Oriented operators Our optimizations use query transformations meta data and caching intermediate results efficiently evaluate query optimal query evaluation plan can generated using algorithm that relies cost estimates One the important observations that accessing sequence data single stream probably very efficient and evaluation strategies should take this into account The details the optimization techniques are described published paper click here for postscript version System Development The SEQ database system has client server architecture supporting multiple clients via multi threaded server The server built top the SHORE storage manager Both Sequin and subset SQL are supported query languages which can embedded inside each other The data model nested complex object model that allows arbitrary levels nesting relations inside sequences and vice versa The system also extensible providing support for new data types new ordering domains user defined functions new storage
