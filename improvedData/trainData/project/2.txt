RISC System Chi Chao Chang Grzegorz Czajkowski Chris Hawblitzel and Thorsten von Eicken appear ACM IEEE Supercomputing Pittsburgh November Abstract The IBM one the most powerful commercial MPPs yet spite its fast processors and high network bandwidth the communication latency inferior older machines such the TMC Meiko This paper investigates the use Active Messages communication primitives alternative the standard message passing order reduce communication overheads and offer good building block for higher layers software The first part this paper describes implementation Active Messages which layered directly top the network adapter With comparable bandwidth low overhead yields round trip latency that lower than IBM MPL The second part the paper demonstrates the power communication substrate layering Split well MPI over Split benchmarks are used compare the other MPPs and show that low message overhead and high throughput compensate for high network latency The MPI

the standard network adapter firmware but does not use any IBM software the Power processor assume familiarity with the concepts underlying Active Messages The main performance characteristics are one

Eicken Veena Avula Anyndia Basu Vineet Buch Presented Hot Interconnects Aug Palo Alto abridged version this paper appears IEEE Micro Magazine Feb Slides from Hot Interconnect talk Abstract Recent developments communication architectures for parallel machines have made significant progress and reduced the communication overheads and latencies over order magnitude compared earlier proposals This paper examines whether these techniques can carry over clusters workstations connected ATM network even though clusters use standard operating system software are equipped with network interfaces optimized for stream communication not allow direct protected user level access the network and use networks without reliable transmission flow control first part this paper describes the differences communication characteristics between clusters workstations built from standard hardware and software components and state the art multiprocessors The lack flow control and operating system coordination affects the communication layer design significantly and requires larger buffers each end than multiprocessors second part evaluates prototype implementation the low latency Active Messages communication model Sun workstation cluster interconnected ATM network Measurements show application application latencies about microseconds for small messages which roughly comparable the Active Messages implementation the Thinking Machines multiprocessor Active Messages Mechanism for Integrated Communication and Computation von Eicken Culler Goldstein and Schauser Proceedings the Int Symp Computer Architecture May Gold Coast Australia Abstract The design challenge for large scale multiprocessors minimize communication overhead allow communication overlap computation and coordinate the two without sacrificing processor cost performance show that existing message passing multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs Research prototypes message driven machines demonstrate low communication overhead but poor processor cost performance introduce simple communication mechanism Active Messages show that intrinsic both architectures allows cost effective use the hardware and offers tremendous flexibility Implementations nCUBE And are described and evaluated using split phase shared memory extension Split further show that active messages are sufficient implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed With this mechanism latency tolerance becomes programming compiling concern Hardware support for active

Andersen Steve Correl Overview Our group part the Department Computer Sciences Univ Texas Austin The long term goal our research develop technology for constructing and using large multifunctional knowledge bases computers These knowledge bases would significantly improve current expert systems and tutoring systems because they contain the broad knowledge domain required perform multiple tasks and explain domain knowledge from multiple viewpoints During the past eight years have built large knowledge base one area biology and developed methods for automatically answering variety questions using the knowledge base Containing about facts concerning concepts our knowledge base one the largest its kind its content structured and formally represented addition expanding this knowledge base are also beginning construct similar knowledge bases other domains most notably the domain Distributed Computing are especially encouraged the results from using our knowledge base for variety tasks Most recently James Lester used the biology knowledge base test his system for explanation generation The system generated about explanations expressed English concerning biological objects and events controlled experiment domain experts found little difference between these explanations and those written their colleagues Currently are extending the types questions that can answered using automated reasoning with large knowledge base Jeff Rickel developed method for compositional modeling the task constructing model appropriate for answering prediction what question Performing this task well requires building the simplest model that can adequately answer the question daunting requirement since knowledge bases like ours implicitly contain MANY models numerous levels detail The Qualitative Process Compiler and QSIM are used simulate the models built Jeff program Finally are testing the generality our research results building knowledge base another domain distributed computing

been considerable interest recently employing simple observer behaviors that either make the recovery scene properties easier fixation combine simple behaviors order perform complex tasks such navigation and obstacle avoidance Our work focuses the ability active observer control the point observation perform tasks involving the exploration object The developed behaviors that are provably correct make simple motion decisions that are based the observed local geometry the scene and require minimal processing each image first consider the task recovering the local shape the surface selected point Our approach based the general observation that some positions provide more information about object than others The existence such special viewpoints can exploited only the observer mobile and has efficient and deterministic strategy for reaching them show that the local shape recovery task can achieved using simple and qualitative strategy for smoothly controlling the point observation until the viewing direction aligned with principal direction the selected point Second consider the task deriving global description object formulate global surface reconstruction the qualitative task smoothly controlling the point observation that the visible rim slides over maximal connected reconstructible region show that this task can provably achieved for arbitrary smooth surfaces attempting maintain well defined geometric relationship between the point observation and the viewed surface Our approach suggests that the ability smoothly control the point observation can lead provably correct behaviors for achieving both local and global tasks scene exploration navigation while also simplifying per frame computations
