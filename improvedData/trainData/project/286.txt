CAD systems provide little support for prototyping mechanical assemblies are creating integrated design and simulation system address this problem Fundamental the effort the investigation effective mechanisms for allowing designer interact with assembly parts virtual manner prior creation any physical prototypes The designer will able touch hold and move models parts and assemblies well see them rendered views The result will environment which part interactions can considered more natural manner than possible with current technology Part interactions and articulations high DOF assemblies can considered early the design process Assembly procedures can evaluated the time when parts are designed without the need explicitly specify assembly sequences constraints Even greater advantages will accrue the design devices intended for human use since manipulability can examined without the need fabricate physical prototype Finally the virtual display tools that are integral this project will give designers better appreciation for complex part geometry than can gained from traditional CAD displays which have only limited information Faculty John Hollerbach Elaine Cohen Stephen Jacobsen William Thompson Staff Russ Fish Graduate Students Rodney Freier David Johnson Ali Nahvi Donald Nelson Thomas Thompson CAD systems for all but the simplest mechanical parts must able provide the designer with clear sense three dimensional object geometry Usually this done with standard graphical rendering techniques involving perspective shading and simple animation When such tools are used for assemblies parts often hear designers complain What really want get hands the parts and see how they fit together fact what happening that the conventional display technologies are not providing the user with sufficient information about the geometry and manipulability the objects question key aspect addressing this limitation augment visual rendering geometric models with haptic interfaces which allow direct manipulation modeled objects Such interfaces must include accurate anthropomorphic geometry and provide realistic force feedback they are real value The Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master represents arguably the most advanced force reflecting exoskeleton available today The upper seven degree freedom arm component matches the redundancy the human arm while three degrees freedom are provided the hand total there are degrees freedom and force reflection per master arm the hand there two degree freedom thumb fixed forefinger and one degree freedom flexing index middle finger The Sarcos Dextrous Arm based hydraulic actuation which unmatched for torque density and bandwidth for this application The result master that much more compact and higher performance than would possible with electric motor drives The pictures above shows one third scale model for novel diesel engine with one cylinder two pistons and four crankshafts and represents the kinds assemblies that are working towards accommodating virtual prototyping system The engine involves complex and interrelated part motions that should well understood designers prior committing expensive fabrication operations full function virtual prototyping system will let the designer manipulate individual parts see how the entire assembly moves Virtual prototyping furthermore would allow designer consider possible assembly sequences modifying parts necessary ease the assembly process Finally virtual prototyping system with sufficiently complete model the human body could used validate assembly operations for the engine Creating user interface for virtual prototyping systems involves solving three largely independent problems Visual rendering involves creating realistic views configuration parts There are two aspects haptic rendering The first involves giving the user realistic sensation that she actually touching and manipulating physical objects The second takes motions made user and modifies the models specifying the virtual world appropriately Contact and interference computations are needed determine part part and user part interactions the virtual world Visual rendering haptic rendering and contact and interference detection must all exploit knowledge about the nature mechanical assemblies since general solutions are not likely viable Geometric modeling systems able support virtual prototyping mechanical assemblies need capabilities beyond those the typical CAD CAM system Not only must possible design and render individual parts but part interactions involving contact forces and torques must computable real time When designer reaches out grab virtual part the system needs know when contact with the part has been made that appropriate feedback can generated Once solid grip has been established user feedback must reflect object inertial and gravity forces and assembly forces due contact For those assemblies capable articulation manipulation one part the assembly must both cause the appropriate motions other parts the assembly and reflect appropriate sensations the user Standard CAD systems are unable supply much the information needed support either assembly operations themselves the haptic rendering required virtual prototyping system
