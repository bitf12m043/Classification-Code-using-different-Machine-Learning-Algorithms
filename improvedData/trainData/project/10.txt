Midsouthwest This forum for researchers theoretical computer science Texas and surrounding states that meets once twice year different locations Each meeting consists several talks researchers the region their recent research results Often there distinguished keynote speaker The first WARM was organized Vijaya Ramachandran Austin the Spring Greg Plaxton organized another WARM Austin Fall WARM has been held several other locations including Texas Dallas Southern Methodist University University North Texas Louisiana State University University Southwestern Louisiana and University Oklahoma The next WARM scheduled held Dallas November Program announcements about WARM are sent out the algorithms mailing list when they become available Also usually try car pool attend WARM when takes place outside Austin Announcements regarding these arrangements are also sent out the algorithms mailing list ACM SIGACT SIGACT stands for the ACM Special Interest Group Algorithms and Computational Theory This very active group that includes many distinguished computer scientists SIGACT sponsors the ACM Symposium Theory Computing STOC and sponsor the ACM SIAM Symposium Discrete Algorithms SODA and the ACM Symposium Parallel Algorithms and Architectures SPAA Other important conferences interest are the IEEE Symposium the Foundations Computer Science FOCS and the IEEE Symposium Computational

Optimizer Paradise Bug Reporting Examine the Sequoia Benchmark scripts used the VLDB paper Information SSL Madison Database Research Group Madison Department ServerObjective The objective the Paradise project design implement and evaluate scalable parallel geographic information system that capable storing and manipulating massive data sets applying object oriented and parallel database technologies the problem storing and manipulating geographic information hope significantly advance the size and complexity GIS data sets that can successfully stored browsed and queried Client Server Paradise Paradise database system aimed handling GIS types applications Paradise provides graphical user interface for querying and browsing the database and supports subset SQL for issuing hoc queries Paradise provides extended relational data model for modeling GIS applications addition support for the base data types such integer real and string Paradise has built support for raster polygon polyline point circle and video mpeg images data Paradise uses SHORE its underlying persistent object manager The Paradise front end allows you display objects with spatial attributes map The map provides layered display for overlapping spatial attributes Each layer corresponds one query You can customize the ordering and display the layers selecting color labelling and other display attributes for each query The database can queried either with graphical interface with hoc queries The graphical interface can used issue implicit spatial queries zooming clicking and sketching rubber banded box For hoc queries Paradise provides query composer Menus the query composer provide access the database schema assist query composition Query results can either viewed the map they have spatial attributes they can displayed table that you can browse the tuples the result The front end also provides context sensitive help Paradise supports subset SQL for issuing hoc queries SQL have added the ability invoke methods defined the extended set types For example you can calculate the area polygon using the method polygon area Paradise also supports the standard database operations including create and drop database create and drop extent create and drop indices insert and update The current version Paradise employs client server architecture The front end ships queries our SQL syntax the Paradise server for execution After executing the query the server ships the result objects back the client The Paradise server multi threaded that multiple clients can connect the same server designing and implementing the Paradise sever careful attention was paid insure that the system could efficiently process queries especially those involving spatial attributes
