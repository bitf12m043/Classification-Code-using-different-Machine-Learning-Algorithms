Osiris whose heart was firm the triumphant the son Isis the heir Osiris The Horus project has developed modular and extensible process group communication system addressing the requirements wide variety robust distributed applications Horus the son Isis and Osiris was god whose attributes appealed strongly the Egyptians from one end Egypt the other because him every man and woman saw the type what she wished possess that say renewed life and life opposed death and movement opposed inactivity Horus provides framework for the development distributed applications based group communications style computing that can arise fault tolerant systems managed distributed systems applications that exploit data replication coherent caching and groupware Within the overall Horus framework large collection system and application protocols have been developed that allow the application designer construct communication module that exactly meets the application requirements minimal cost The Horus project was originally launched effort redesign the Isis group communication system but has evolved into general purpose communication architecture with advanced support for the development robust distributed systems settings for which Isis was unsuitable such applications that have special security real time requirements Besides the practical uses our software the project has contributed towards the theory virtually synchrony runtime model used for our implementation data replication and fault tolerance the same time our software much faster and lighter weight than the Isis system Horus exists two systems initial version coded which can used for research purposes fee but has restricted commerical rights and new version called Ensemble written but usable from many other languages which available for all classes users fee Ensemble actively under development and will series releases over the fall and spring early Ensemble will outstanding environment for building Java based groupware applications that multimedia conferencing the Web Horus and Ensemble are designed platform independent and are available for different classes workstations personal computers parallel processors and next generation cluster environments using standard high speed communications networks The Horus effort collaborates closely with many other distributed systems projects including Transis NavTech and the StormCast and TACOMA projects Links these and other projects can found elsewhere these pages Introductions Horus Visit the papers and abstract pages for overview all
