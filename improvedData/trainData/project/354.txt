University Nashville Tennessee USA Phone FAX Email dfisher vuse vanderbilt edu full list publications can found the latter portion this page Gradually abstracts these publications will placed line html form with pointers subsequent work raw data reader comments and other material appropriate for addendum list current online reports addenda are given first Online Reports and Addenda many cases technical reports and electronic addenda published work will placed line here both postscript and html format though not necessarily the same time Your comments are welcome certain these cases should you email comments regarding related literature suggestions for experimental theoretical improvements alternative viewpoints then your comments reasonable and informative they will linked the html version the technical report addendum and under separate list comments unless you state that you not want this done may also link responses your comments but not before getting your feedback response Comments purely style issues are welcome but they probably will not linked Others who view the technical report will free view your comments well your comments inform revision the report for publication then will acknowledge them personal communication otherwise cite the literature that you relate deem relevant your comments are online and linked report then you agree allow others cite them personal communication well again unless you state that your comments should not linked The following list technical report titles addenda etc that are currently online These are links either
