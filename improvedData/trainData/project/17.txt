dedicated Guide Dog AsTeR Audio System For Technical Readings computing system for rendering technical documents audio AsTeR was developed for PhD pages audio formatted version the thesis approximately hours produced AsTeR being made available RFB Recordings For the Blind the first computer generated talking book Here the abstract print and here audio formatted version This hypertext document demonstrates the audio renderings generated AsTeR Here enhanced demo using inline images Each example made three components The original LaTeX input The audio formatted output produced AsTeR The speech produced Dectalk and has been digitized bit mulaw AsTeR uses stereo render tables effect that not conveyed the bit mono encoding The visually formatted version produced LaTeX and DVIPS How use this demo The examples this demonstration get progressively difficult suggest you through the initial sections sequentially For short demos typically show people the first three sections and round off with the continuous fraction section and quick overview Faa Bruno formula Here the Postscript file containing all the examples case you want look over them first not placing single file containing all the audio examples since this would about Section simple fractions and expressions This set examples demonstrates the use voice inflection and pauses convey grouping sub expressions succinctly audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Audio state varied along dimension audio space before rendering sub expressions Section superscripts and subscripts convey subscripts superscripts and other visual attributes vary audio state along dimension that orthogonal independent the dimension used convey sub expressions This will allow the nesting these mutually independent concepts audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Knuth examples fractions and exponents These examples are taken verbatim from the TeX Book Donald Knuth They are used the TeX Book demonstrate the power the TeX layout operators Notice that all these examples comprise the same symbols but are very different AsTeR can render these unambiguously TeX can audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section continued fraction Moving along dimension audio space defines perceptibly monotonic change This notion perceptible monotonicity vital conveying nesting audio LaTeX Postscript Section Simple School algebra audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section square roots Notice the choice unambiguous renderings for the following expressions audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Trigonometric identities Written mathematical notation can ambiguous and hard recognize Notice the complete absence parenthesis some the examples below AsTeR uses several heuristics construct the correct tree structure for these expressions audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Logarithms Notice the context specific rendering when speaking the base the logarithm The renderings are chosen reduce cognitive load log base opposed log the base audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Series Context specific rendering rules allow AsTeR interpret the superscripts exponents Such interpretation not hard wired into the renderings fully customizable the user audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Integrals The first these examples probably the most innocuous also the most difficult recognize impossible determine the variable integration Notice that AsTeR interprets triple integrals the nested application the integral operator user can browse the triple integral and listen its sub pieces The integrals shown examples and can trick the most experienced human readers into error audio LaTeX Postscript

audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Limits audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Cross referenced equations The following section meant illustrate AsTeR rendering cross references and most effective when AsTeR used interactively AsTeR enables the listener give meaningful names cross referenceable objects and uses these names when referring such objects later cross references audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section Distance formula Notice that AsTeR produces good intonational structure when speaking text that intermixed with mathematics audio LaTeX Postscript Section Quantified expression The quantifiers present interesting challenge AsTeR recognizer audio LaTeX Postscript Section Exponentiation Once again perceptible monotonicity allows AsTeR convey the following deeply nested expressions succinctly These examples were produced with the Emacs Calculator full fledged symbolic algebra system AsTeR interfaces directly with this calculator and renders the output just well can render any document audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript audio LaTeX Postscript Section generic matrix AsTeR uses stereo effects convey the two dimensional structure the matrix Rendering commences the left and moves progressively right each element any row spoken audio LaTeX Postscript Section Faa Bruno formula This section presents Faa Bruno formula taken from Knuth Art Computer Programming Vol first heard spoken RFB reader talking book took seconds speak Since the renderings produced AsTeR utilize features the audio space not available human reader still have not met reader who can change the size and shape her head she talks the rendering takes under seconds you will hear soon even this too long you forget the beginning the time you hear the end Later present rendering using variable substitution powerful technique for conveying top level structure complex expressions Notice the proper intonational structure produced for text intermixed with mathematics audio LaTeXPostscript audio LaTeX Postscript Here Faa Bruno formula all its glory Audio seconds LaTeX Postscript AsTeR can process complex expressions like the above and upon request replace complex sub expressions with meaningful identifiers Such renderings convey top level structure the listener can then listen the sub expressions separately Since this substitution process performed AsTeR there LaTeX Postscript equivalent for the audio output this case The top level formula audio seconds Lower

This WWW page describes work Pattern Separation via Linear Programming the Mathematical Programming section the University Wisconsin Madison Computer Sciences Department Brief History and Method Outline Mathematical optimization approaches particular linear programming have long been used problems pattern separation linear programs were used construct planes separate linearly separable point sets Separation nonlinear surface using linear programming was also described whenever the surface parameters appeared linearly quadratic polynomial surface These formulations however could fail sets that were not separable surface linear its parameters Multisurface Method MSM avoided this difficulty MSM separates disjoint finite point sets dimensional Euclidean space follows Choose parallel planes dimensional Euclidean space close together that only the region between the two planes contains points from both sets the regions NOT between the parallel planes contain only points set points Discard the points the regions not between the parallel planes Repeat the process the points between the parallel planes until the region between the parallel planes contains points very few points Multisurface Method Tree MSM variant the Multisurface Method was developed Let and finite disjoint point sets dimensional Euclidean space The goal MSM determine sequence planes dimensional Euclidean space that separate the sets and follows Determine plane dimensional Euclidean space that minimizes the average distances misclassified points point from set misclassified lies the side the separating plane assigned Similarly point from set misclassified lies the side the separating plane assigned the regions assigned and contain only mostly points the set then stop Otherwise generate another error minimizing plane this region The sequence planes generated can viewed decision tree For each node the tree the best split the points reaching that node found solving the above The node split into branches and the same procedure applied until there are only mostly points one set the node This linear programming approach can also viewed training neural network with hidden layer see MSM has been shown learn concepts well better than more traditional learning methods such and CART also has advantage over artificial neural network ANN methods such backpropagation that training proceeds much faster see Implementations MSM MSM has been implemented using the MINOS numerical optimization package Nick Street and Kristin Bennett MSM has also been implemented for the MATLAB optimization package
