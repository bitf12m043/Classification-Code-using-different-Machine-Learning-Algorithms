Database ProjectCoral Database ProjectDocument Contents ObjectiveOverviewRelease InformationSee Also Publications related CoralPeople working CoralOther Research MadisonObjective The objective the CORAL project develop robust and efficient deductive database system and investigate its use various application domains Several the algorithms underlying the Coral system have been developed members the group during the duration the project since Overview Coral deductive system which supports rich declarative language and interface which allows for combination declaritive and imperative programming The declarative query language supports general Horn clauses augmented with complex terms set grouping aggregation negation and relations with tuples that contain universally quantified variables CORAL declarative program can organized collection interacting modules The CORAL implementation supports wide range evaluation strategies and automatically chooses efficient evaluation strategy for each module the program addition users are permitted guide query optimization desired selecting from among wide range control choices the level each module The CORAL system provides imperative constructs such update insert and delete rules CORAL also has interface with and users can program combination declarative CORAL and extended with CORAL primitives high degree extensibility provided allowing programmers use the class structure enhance the CORAL implemenation CORAL provides support for both main memory and disk resident data Disk resident data supported using the EXODUS storage mananger which also provides transaction management client server environment Release Information The current release Coral Version released October install Coral your system then grab the tar
