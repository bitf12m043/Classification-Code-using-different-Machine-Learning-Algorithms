Amanda ALPHA RELEASE NOTES May The latest version Amanda always available via anonymous ftp from ftp umd edu pub amanda PLEASE NOTE THIS SOFTWARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE UMD making this work available that other people can use This software production use our home site the UMCP Department Computer Science but make warranties that will work for you Amanda development unfunded the author maintains the code his spare time result there support available other than users helping each other the amanda users mailing list See below for information the mailing lists WHAT NEW SINCE number material bugs fixed including fixes incorporated into John Stoffel WPI patches amanda which called Backup files larger than now supported The current limit Kbytes terabytes which should hold for few more years Support for GNUTAR based backups Support for writing multiple tapes sequentially one run Support for multiple backups parallel from the same client host Records from the curinfo database can exported and imported from textual format This allows fixing corrupted database running the text version through script and reimporting Individual records the entire database can exported imported More details for these new features can found docs WHATS NEW WHAT LEFT FOR AMANDA Release engineering and porting many platforms Update and extend the documentation Archival dumps via skip incr are not doing the right thing Pick many little nits Probably lots other things WHAT NEW SINCE number material bugs fixed lot lint picked the whole package The documentation now reasonably date This version has been locally compiled and least the client side tested the following systems SunOS IRIX Solaris BSDI BSD Ultrix NetBSD DEC OSF AIX don have any machines locally try but tracked patches submitted Neal Becker neal ctd comset com reasonably confident that shouldn far from the mark that platform WHAT NEW SINCE Many things have changed since Amanda Here are the major items SYSV shared memory longer required server side mmap available Supports GZIP compression Supports use mount names well device names disk list usr instead Amanda now thinks real time you may run several times day you wish and won get confused Supports Kerberos security well BSD style rhosts including encrypting files over the net The Kerberos support available separate add package see the file KERBEROS HOW GET the ftp site Improved network protocol faster startup longer dump specific hooks place for non dump clients Client side checks amcheck can check sanity all client hosts very quickly Supports multiple holding disks and load balances between them More details are available docs WHATS NEW WHAT AMANDA This alpha test release Amanda the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver Amanda backup system designed archive many computers network single large capacity tape drive This release currently daily use the University Maryland College Park Computer Science Department backing all the disks all the workstations the department currently over gigabytes data across more than filesystems more than workstations and servers using single Gigabyte Exabyte EXB Here are some features Amanda written freely distributable built top standard backup software BSD Unix dump restore and later GNU Tar and others will back multiple machines parallel holding disk blasting finished dumps one one tape fast can write files tape For example tape interface host with large holding disk can filled Amanda under hours does simple tape management will not overwrite the wrong tape supports tape changers via generic interface Easily customizable any type tape carousel robot stacker that can controlled via the unix command line supports Kerberos security including encrypted dumps The Kerberos support available separate add package see the file KERBEROS HOW GET the ftp site and the file docs KERBEROS this package for more details for restore tells you what tapes you need and finds the proper backup image the tape for you recovers gracefully from errors including down hung machines reports results including all errors detail email operators will dynamically adjust backup schedule keep within constraints more juggling hand when adding disks and computers network includes pre run checker program that conducts sanity checks both the tape server host and all the client hosts parallel and will send mail report any problems that could cause the backups fail can compress dumps before sending over net with either compress gzip can optionally syncronize with external backups for those large timesharing computers where you want full dumps when the system down single user mode since BSD dump not reliable active filesystems Amanda will still your daily dumps lots other options Amanda very configurable WHAT ARE THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR AMANDA Amanda requires host that mostly idle night with large capacity tape drive EXABYTE DAT tape This becomes the tape server host All the computers you are going dump are the backup client hosts The server host can also client host Amanda works best with one more large holding disk partition the server host available for buffering dumps before writing tape The holding disk allows Amanda run backups parallel the disk only writing them tape when the backup finished Note that the holding disk not required without Amanda will run backups sequentially the tape drive Running this way kills the great performance but still allows you take advantage Amanda other features rule thumb for best performance the holding disk should larger than the dump output from your largest disk partitions For example you are backing some full gigabyte disks that compress down then you want your holding disk the other hand those gigabyte drives are partitioned into filesystems they probably compress down and you only need that much your holding disk Amanda will perform better with larger holding disks use for our holding disk Actually Amanda will still work you have full dumps that are larger than the holding disk Amanda will send those dumps directly tape one time you have many such dumps you will limited the dump speed those machines WHAT SYSTEMS DOES AMANDA RUN Amanda should run any modern Unix system that supports dump has sockets and inetd and either system shared memory BSD mmap implemented particular Amanda has been compiled and the client side tested the following systems SunOS IRIX SunOS BSDI BSD Ultrix NetBSD DEC OSF AIX only run the server side under SunOS but compiles all those platforms and have reason this time beleive will not work addition have tracked patches for the following systems that don run house FreeBSD Linux NextStep HOW GET AMANDA AND RUNNING docs INSTALL contains general installation instructions docs SYSTEM NOTES contains system specific information docs KERBEROS explains installation under Kerberos docs TAPE CHANGERS explains how customize the changer interface docs WHATS NEW details new features WHO
