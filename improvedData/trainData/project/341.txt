Report for the project Scalable Library For Numerical Linear Algebra for fiscal year available for viewing Click here see the SuperComputing ScaLAPACK poster The ScaLAPACK project collaborative effort between Oak Ridge National Laboratory Rice University University California Berkeley University California Los Angeles University Illinois University Tennessee Knoxville The ScaLAPACK project made components dense matrix software ScaLAPACK large sparse eigenvalue software PARPACK sparse direct systems software CAPSS preconditioners for large sparse iterative solvers PARPRE ScaLAPACK version includes routines for the solution dense band and tridiagonal linear systems equations condition estimation and iterative refinement for and Cholesky factorization matrix inversion full rank linear least squares problems orthogonal and generalized orthogonal factorizations orthogonal transformation routines reductions upper Hessenberg bidiagonal and tridiagonal form reduction symmetric definite Hermitian definite generalized eigenproblem standard form the symmetric Hermitian generalized symmetric Hermitian and the nonsymmetric eigenproblem Software available single precision real double precision real single precision complex and double precision complex The software has been written portable across wide range distributed memory environments such the Cray IBM Intel series clusters workstations and any system for which PVM MPI available draft the ScaLAPACK Users Guide and comprehensive Installation Guide provided well test suites for all ScaLAPACK PBLAS and BLACS routines Future releases ScaLAPACK will include routines for the solution general banded linear systems general and symmetric positive definite tridiagonal systems rank deficient linear least squares problems generalized linear least squares problems and the singular value decomposition Also available will the full index PBLAS which will have the majority alignment restrictions removed well the ability operate partial first blocks The next release ScaLAPACK slated for Fall PARPACK Parallel ARPACK extension the ARPACK software package used for solving large scale eigenvalue problems distributed memory parallel architectures The message passing layers currently supported are BLACS and MPI Serial ARPACK must retrieved and installed prior installing PARPACK All core ARPACK routines are available single precision real double precision real single precision complex and double precision complex extensive set driver routines are available for ARPACK and subset these are available for parallel computation with PARPACK These may used templates that are easily modified construct problem specific parallel interface PARPACK CAPSS fully parallel package solve sparse linear system the form message passing multiprocessor the matrix assumed symmetric positive definite and associated with mesh two three dimensions This version has been tested the Intel Paragon and makes possible efficient parallel solution for several right hand side vectors PARPRE package parallel preconditioners for general sparse matrices includes classical point block relaxation methods generalised block SSOR preconditioners this includes ILU and domain decomposition methods additive and multiplicative Schwarz Schur complement The communication protocol MPI and low level routines from the Petsc library are used but installing the complete Petsc library not necessary Funding for this effort comes part from DARPA DOE NSF and CRPC Comments suggestions may sent scalapack utk edu SCALAPACK
