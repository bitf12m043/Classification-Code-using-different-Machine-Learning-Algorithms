University Utah Salt Lake City Utah USA Under the auspices the NSF CISE Infrastructure Award CDA have pursued number computer aided prototyping activities the Department Computer Science are working the design and prototyping software VLSI and electro mechanical systems Prototyping such complex systems typically involves the integration dissimilar entities mechanical parts software electronic hardware sensors and actuators Our goal develop prototyping environments which many types information involved system design can combined coordinated way are very interested building systems that require heavy interdisciplinary interaction between number engineering disciplines The national needs robotics automation manufacturing and intelligent systems are pushing scientists and engineers learn more about different disciplines able build coherent systems Using computers build platforms and environments for various prototyping activities those fields becoming necessity The end product research this highly interdisciplinary nature would Prototyping environments software and hardware that allow the concurrent design engineering systems manipulators mobile robots electromechanical structures MEMS operating systems and schedulers for manufacturing applications Actual tools hardware and software systems and machines The end applications the developed environments and platforms can range from real time distributed operating systems for specialized machines and electromechanical equipments mobile robots for specific tasks micro nano sensors actuators and manipulators real time visualizations biological entities under outer space constraints process plans for manufacturing under tolerance requirements The interdisciplinary nature the computer aided prototyping research provides exciting opportunities develop new and efficient algorithms and strategies for coordinating the efforts the different groups involved believe that graduating engineers especially the fields computer science and engineering and electrical engineering should have much more interdisciplinary knowledge about other engineering physics and mathematics areas than what they currently have the average The interdisciplinary nature our research provides exceptional educational environment for those involved the work Our practice insure that each research associate aware and contributes all aspects the big project not just the individual research problem she working the time The intention produce graduates with depth and breadth experience which makes them especially well qualified tackle demanding problems science and engineering The United States experiencing major economic battle the global market place The main justification for research this nature that success will put better competitive position vis vis the rest the world the approach computer aided prototyping and its use solve reliably efficiently modularly and rapidly number problems within electromechanical and physical systems design and modeling real time software and hardware controllers monitors and observers succeeds then stand significantly impact prototyping automation and manufacturing During the past three years have been working the coordination and integration the efforts the different groups involved the computer aided prototyping projects the Department Computer Science particular are working developing theoretical and experimental tools environments and systems for integrating sensing robotics CAD CAM languages and VLSI efforts within number CISE projects The CISE reverse engineering and inspection project has been successful project which started September and significant results ensued That project led the SAM Sensing for Advanced Manufacturing project and the Feature Based Reverse Engineering paradigm which huge undertaking that has been ongoing since August with four faculty and students working under the direction Professors Bill Thompson and Thomas Henderson The CISE robot prototyping environment project resulted concurrent and flexible design environment for prototyping robots addition the URK Utah Robot Kit robot the Hybrid Systems Control Project are working develop graphical DES Discrete Event System hybrid controller simulator and analysis framework The framework allows for the control simulation and monitoring dynamic systems that exhibits combination symbolic continuous discrete and chaotic behaviors and includes stochastic timing descriptions probabilistic transitions controllability and observability definitions temporal timed state space petri nets and recursive representations analysis and synthesis algorithms Major CISE and CISE related Projects The Utah Robot Kit URK and the Utah Prototyping Environment UPE
