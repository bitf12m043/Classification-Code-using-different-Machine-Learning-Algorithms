TappetaBrett Wujek Computer Science and Engineering Eric JohnsonArun Lokanathan Stan Yoder Introduction and Goals The purpose this three year reseach project develop framework and systematic methodology facilitate the application Multidisciplinary Design Optimization MDO diverse class system design problems MDO based upon the philosophy identifying the appropriate combination parameters which are under the control designer design team and which will result the most effective product system For all practical aerospace systems the design systems complex sequence events which integrates the activities variety discipline experts and their associated tools The development archiving and exchange information between these individual experts central the design task this information which provides the basis for these experts make their design decisions resulting the final product The development MDO has been inextricably tied developments computer hardware and software Advanced analysis tools such computational fluid dynamics CFD and finite element analysis FEA have now been integrated into the daily activities many designers However design decisions are often based variety information sources analytic numerical simulation design heuristic even intuition The development and integration this information using high powered computing tools has begun demonstrate the true potential MDO variety methods and applications are being considered each case the fundamental approach provide the individual discipline expert with the information necessary evaluate the system whole and able understand the impact individual decisions the overall system design The methods being considered include extensions Global Sensitivity Equations GSE the application artificial neural networks for design space mapping and the integration distributed computing and process scheduling into the MDO environment The current research effort joint program between the Departments Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and the Computer Science and Engineering Departments the University Notre Dame The coordination efforts within the project based upon identification series Demonstration Problems the formulation number MDO Algorithms and specific Design Tool Development Test problem and algorithm development provide focus for the efforts each these individual researchers These problems are being selected that they represent diverse spectrum MDO applications and will present variety challenges for the methods being developed and evaluated part this research program this three year program continues information related each the primary phases the project will added this document The results those issues identified Future Efforts will used assess applicability the MDO tools wide variety applications number references are available which outline various developments associated with this research program The Annual Report which summarizes the research activities from October October can accessed and the slides used for the Annual Presentation NASA Langley Research Center October are being processed for posting this web site The following are selection recent publications developed part this research program Many are attached postscipt files and you have postscript viewer they should accessible for review and copying you are unable access any these papers
