Vector quantization increasingly being used lossy data compression technique for sources such speech images and video Practical vector quantizers structure their codebooks simplify encoding and decoding For example block transform CELP tree structured two stage lattice quadtree product pyramid and finite state vector quantizers are common techniques listed roughly decreasing order structure Although structure generally has adverse effect rate distortion performance permits the use quantizers with larger dimensions which usually results much better performance for given complexity Until now there has been little theory explain the complexity performance tradeoff structured vector quantizers This project developing new methods for analyzing structured vector quantizers One extension Bennett integral vector quantizers shows how the mean squared error depends the distribution and shape quantization cells Another asymptotic formula for the probability density the quantization error These new methods have lead the successful analysis several structured vector quantizers including tree structured and two stage quantizers Still another the analysis transform coders very low rates The insight gained from this analysis has also led new form two stage quantization called cell conditioned multi stage that has the same low complexity advantages traditional multi stage quantization but asymptotically suffers loss performance relative unstructured quantization has also lead new high performance low complexity methods for converting entropy coders into fixed rate coders Model Based Digital Image Halftoning Professor Neuhoff New model based approaches halftoning are being developed They use well known models visual perception along with models printing that have developed One approach minimizes the mean squared error between the perceived intensity the continuous tone image and the perceived intensity the printed halftoned image Another adaptation the well known error diffusion method include the printer model Traditional approaches for example ordered clustered dither obtain robustness printer distortions such ink spreading the expense spatial resolution and the visibility graininess contrast our new methods exploit the printer distortions produce higher quality images than would obtained with RperfectS printers Improvements due model based halftoning are expected reduce the resolution requirements for laser printers used high quality printing dots inch instead Model based halftoning can especially useful transmission high quality documents using high fidelity gray scale image encoders such cases halftoning performed the receiver just before printing Apart from coding efficiency this approach permits the halftoner tuned the individual printer whose characteristics may vary considerably from those other printers for example write black write white laser printers Image Coding Gracuate Students Horowitz Slyz Professor Neuhoff Image coding the process creating binary image representations with the dual goals efficiency few bits possible the representation and accuracy the reproduced images shall similar possible the original Two approaches are being pursued The first involves the use detailed model the intermediate level human visual sensors construct transform codes that hide quantization noise The second involves the design lossless image codes based adaptive prediction with new kinds predictors and adaptation strategies These lossless image codes are intended for applications such medical imaging where exact reproduction the image required the other hand the first project intended for more everyday applications where exact reproduction not necessary but good quality and high efficiency are needed Performance and Complexity CDMA Networks with Coded Modulation Graduate Students Klimesh Sung Professors Stark and Coffey Sponsors National Science Foundation There are two parts this research project The first part deals with decoding algorithms for worst case interference this work have derived transmission and decoding strategies that allows for maximum information transmission minimum error probability These strategies allow the transmitter vary the transmission power pseudorandomly The performance maximum likelihood decoding algorithm against the worst case jammer can improved Worst case interference derived well the resulting performance The second part involves developing novel decoders and demodulators that achieve favorable tradeoffs complexity versus performance Within this area number current topics are being investigated such the design minimal trellises for block codes fundamental limits for decoders with reduced number states decoding algorithms for time varying channels and Spread Spectrum Faded Channels Graduate Students Goeckel and Chang Professor Stark this project are examining the performance spread spectrum systems faded channel The type fading such that one spread spectrum system with relatively small bandwidth the fading appears nonselective frequency another spread spectrum system the fading frequency selective The goal examine the performance direct sequence spread spectrum system operating the presence multipath fading with error control coding The important issues are the channels memory the selectivity the channel the synchronization algorithm and the decoding approach These are issues that are not very well understood system designers presently Our preliminary results indicate that for nonselective channel larger spreading improves performance spite the fact that more the received energy treated interference rather than part faded signal other words the bandwidth increases the multipath channel becomes more resolveable and signals that were unresolved before can resolved and rejected the processing gain the spread spectrum system Communicating Over Power Lines Graduate Student Wang Professor Stark The goal this research investigate different alternatives for transmitting data over power line The power line suffers from distortion because the nonideal characteristics the media This comes two forms The first due the attenuation varying function frequency The second form multipath due reflections off mismatched lines Transmitting data over power lines using spread spectrum techniques can mitigate the distortion present the channel are investigating different modulation and coding schemes with spread spectrum for transmitting data over the power line Optical Communications and Very Noisy Channels Graduate Student Lee Professor Winick very noisy channel channel whose capacity close zero Very noisy channels VNCs can used model many physical channels operating low signal noise ratios More importantly large class physical channels operating arbitrary signal noise ratios can modeled repeated uses VNC particular this true for the infinite bandwidth additive white Gaussian noise channel and the direct detection optical Poisson channel The error exponent indicates the best achievable performance any block codes used over communications channel code which achieves this best performance said exponentially optimum For most channels the error exponent not known and can only bounded this research the error exponent computed exactly for large class VNCs and exponentially optimum codes are explicitly constructed for these channels These ideas are applied derive both the error exponent and exponentially optimum codes for the direct detection polarization switched optical channel Distance Bounds for Runlength Constrained Codes Graduate Student Yang Professor Winick One the most basic problems coding theory find the largest code given length and minimum distance There are several known upper and lower bounds when the codewords are unconstrained many digital transmission and recording systems considerations such spectral shaping self clocking and reduction intersymbol interference require that the recorded sequences satisfy special run length constraints this research distance bounds and the construction runlength constrained error correcting codes are investigated Upper bounds are derived for the minimum achievable distance runlength constrained sequences and lower bounds are also derived which include cost constraints Runlength Constrained Write Once Memories Graduate Student Yang

industry are punch cards paper tapes PROMs and optical disks Current laser optics technology produces the write once ROMs that are especially sutiable for storing archival data Usually this data must

Winick Sponsors National Science Foundation NSF Center for Ultrafast Optical Science Smith Industries IMRA America Inc Recently the development rare earth doped fiber lasers has received considerable attention These fiber lasers exhibit host desirable properties First they permit wide tuning ranges and short pulse generation because their broad emission lines Second the pump powers required for lasing are low since the pump beam strongly confined small volume Finally rare earth doped lasers offer better frequency stability longer lifetimes and less temperature sensitivity than semiconductor devices These traits make them promising devices for telecommunications sensing and spectroscopic applications Glass waveguide lasers planar substrates are natural extension the fiber technology
