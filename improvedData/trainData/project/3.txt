SUBCONTRACTORS Jet Propulsion Laboratories PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS Leonard Kleinrock and Larry Bergman PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS Nicholas Bambos Jason Cong Eli Gafni Mario Gerla OBJECTIVE The major focus this research the design testing and prototyping novel high performance optical interconnection network for supercomputers which based optically communicating mesh routers crossbars and which scalable The geographic coverage ranges from interdepartmental campus and even metropolitan areas The network provides very high speed multiple services supporting hybrid circuit switched and datagram traffic and direct multi hop connections that are dynamically reconfigurable first networking level locally interconnect workstations supercomputers peripheral devices mass memory etc through host interfaces higher networking level use fully optical interconnects allowing communication between devices connected distinct mesh routers goal this research capture the large latent distributed computational power the network processors used for network control and management leading intelligent network main motivation for the research stems from the limitations observed current supercomputer interconnect systems and from the opportunities offered emerging communication technologies such WDM optoelectronics for novel feasible system architectures APPROACH propose overcome the usual interconnect problems replacing the point point links with all optical interconnect system Namely the high speed LANS will connected optical star tree physical topology Wavelength Division Multiplexing WDM will used subdivide the very large fiber bandwidth into several channels each Gbps bandwidth WDM channels supporting also time division multiplexing will established between modules thus defining dense virtual interconnection topology which dynamically reconfigurable responding changing traffic patterns pool channels will set aside for direct end end connections between mesh routers providing circuit switched service for real time traffic applications The heart the Distributed Supercomputer Supernet OPTIMIC OPTical Interconnect MyriNet chips OPTIMIC novel high performance network consisting Myricom asynchronous pipeline crossbars APC interconnected WDM optical backbone supports both circuit switched and packet switched datagram traffic achieves virtual topology reconfigurable interconnection through optical star tree and bases its networking operations the intelligent fabric the network itself OPTIMIC each network node APC connected local hosts other nodes and multiple optical channels via Optical Channel Interface OCI The optical interconnection and the use their intelligence computational power for network operation and control will supported several

Detection and Classification Deformable Contours Modeling Extraction Detection and Classification Kok Fung Lai Roland Chin have developed integrated approach modeling extracting detecting and classifying deformable contours directly from noisy images have conducted case study regularization formulation and initialization active contour models snakes Using the minimax principle derived regularization criterion whereby the values can automatically and implicitly determined along the contour Furthermore formulated set energy functionals which yield snakes that contain Hough transform special case Subsequently considered the problem modeling and extracting arbitrary deformable contours from noisy images combined stable invariant and unique contour model with Markov random fields yield prior distribution that exerts influence over arbitrary global model while allowing for deformation Under the Bayesian framework contour extraction turns into posterior estimation which turn equivalent energy minimization generalized active contour model Finally integrated these lower level visual tasks with pattern recognition processes detection and classification Based the Nearman Pearson lemma derived the optimal detection and classification tests the summation peaked most practical applications only small regions need considered marginalizing the distribution The validity our formulation has been confirmed extensive and rigorous experimentation GSNAKE software available
