under the NSF HPCC Multidisciplinary Challenge Program The project expand interactive simulations and virtual world models disk based storage Today virtually all such systems require that the model data fit main memory The project has many aspects including the design appropriate storage structures real time delivery model data response user actions inclusion quality service tradeoffs into resource management and many others The applications explicitly addressed the project span range including urban simulation models Figure from Department Architecture and Urban Design interactive visualization plasma physics data Figure from Physics Department and from the medial domain virtual aneursm work The storage server will designed and implemented the Computer Science Department and will serve over ATM lines users the department architecture and the plasma physics lab well locally for the aneurysm research Aside from adapting and interfacing the above existing applications the storage server will also work the actual design the storage server and integration the auxiliary databases With respect the integration spatial databases will exploring novel uses the interactive

Information Source Binaries and Documentation The Beta release Shore version Publications related Shore People working Shore Latest Research Summary for ARPA Paradise Project GIS built SHORE EXODUS Project the predecessor Shore Benchmark benchmark for OODBs Shore Photo Album Madison Database Research Group Madison Department Server Objective The objective the SHORE project design implement and evaluate persistent object system that will serve the needs wide variety target applications including hardware and software CAD systems persistent programming languages geographic information systems satellite data repositories and multi media applications Shore expands the basic capabilities the widely used EXODUS Storage Manager developed Wisconsin funded ARPA number ways including support for typed objects multiple programming languages Unix like hierarchical name space for named objects and Unix compatible interface objects with text field This interface intended ease the transition applications from the Unix file system environment Shore existing Unix tools such and will able store their data Shore objects without modification basically Unix file becomes either single Shore object the text field more complex object Overview SHORE something hybrid system nature inheriting characteristics both from object oriented database systems and from file systems This section briefly describe the basic features SHORE The paper Shoring Persistent Applications describes SHORE much greater detail SHORE has three major goals Scalability Support for hardware and language heterogeneity Support for existing file based applications When the SHORE project began years ago these goals were unique among the research and commercial OODBMS community While the ODMG effort has also concentrated providing some degree support for language heterogeneity which turn facilitates hardware heterogeneity SHORE remains distinguished its focus scalability and support for applications that depend the Unix file system for persistent storage Furthermore since the SHORE data model SDL basically compatible with the ODMG data model ODL expect that much the technology that develop can eventually transferred the commercial sector Scalable Architecture SHORE software architecture unique several ways First SHORE uses symmetric peer peer distributed architecture SHORE every participating processor runs SHORE server process whether not the processor has SHORE data disks attached The software has been designed scalable can run single processor network workstations large parallel processor such the Intel Paragon IBM This design contrast the client server architecture used EXODUS and all the OODBMS vendors While client server architecture fine for design environment such typically used software and hardware CAD efforts not scalable The second unique feature the SHORE architecture its notion value added server structuring the software that runs the server with extensibility mind relatively simple for users build application specific servers For example the Paradise project already using the SHORE server build geographic information system for NASA EOSDIS project feel that these two unique pieces technology will play important role variety future research and commercial endeavors For example the digital libraries the future will almost certainly depend the availability scalable persistent object technology Such systems are going store retrieve manipulate and transmit objects containing video and pictures well text While current OODBMS products could used these systems are oriented toward dealing with gigabytes and not terabytes data Customizability equally important The indexing retrieval and query processing mechanisms needed for digital library are very different from those required for geographic information system Language and Hardware Heterogeneity Objects SHORE are typed SHORE provides single language neutral type system that used define the types all SHORE objects This type system embodied the SHORE Data Language SDL which the language which SHORE object types are defined SDL enhances the OMG data model IDL with support for database features such bulk types sets and lists and persistence The provision typed persistent objects simplifies the task supporting heterogeneous hardware environments and makes feasible support access persistent objects from multiple programming languages which key objective the SHORE project mentioned earlier SDL quite closely related ODL the language neutral object type definition language that was recently proposed standard the OODB vendor consortium ODMG terms its emphasis however ODMG has largely concentrated providing standardized interface existing oriented OODBs Our focus support for inter language object sharing within large name space objects Support for Existing File based Applications major goal SHORE enable applications that currently use untyped byte oriented files for their persistent data flattening and flattening their data each time accessed stop doing Such applications should able store their data typed structured objects for more convenient type safe intra and inter program data sharing Our ultimate hope that SHORE will displace byte oriented file systems such the Unix file system SHORE provides two major services from file system standpoint First support object naming and space management world with many persistent objects SHORE provides flexible tree structured Unix like name space which all persistent objects are reachable either directly indirectly Doing gives SHORE users familiar framework which register individual persistent objects termed registered objects the roots large persistent data structures bulk sets unnamed objects termed anonymous objects The realization this framework involves several different kinds SHORE file system objects including directories pools which are files containing anonymous objects symbolic links and cross references SHORE provides two mechanisms ease the transition legacy Unix applications such compilers editors and CAD systems from traditional byte stream files SHORE First for applications that can linked SHORE provides standard Unix compatible file system interface open close read write mkdir chdir order make access SHORE objects via Unix file system calls possible the definer SHORE object type can optionally designate one variable length byte string character string attribute the object being the object Unix data Programs that attempt read object through SHORE counterparts the Unix file system calls will only see this portion the object For legacy programs that wish without being linked possible NFS mount SHORE file system and access the Unix data contained its objects directly This makes feasible for both new and old applications access the same set objects While old applications can only access the Unix data component the object new applications can define and access other more structured attributes the object Release Information Below the latest time table for the release SHORE These dates are approximate and subject change you have any questions contact shore support wisc

Mon Mar CST Nancy Hall nhall wisc edu Footnotes compatibility with ODL SHORE and ODMG concurrently decided use the OMG data model IDL the starting point for their data models Hence SDL and ODL are very similar one another Once ODL stabilizes can convert SDL compatible with ODL
