computer systems usable for Fortran programmers this effort special emphasis placed data parallel programming and scalable parallelism achieve this goal researchers are developing coordinated programming system that includes compilers and tools for Fortran extended dialect Fortran that supports machine independent data parallel programming The tools support variety parallel programming activities including intelligent editing and program transformation parallel debugging performance estimation performance visualization and tuning and automatic data partitioning Research efforts also include validation the compilers and tools realistic applications well investigations new functionality handle irregular computations parallel and automatic differentiation using the program analysis infrastructure developed for the project Fortran Language and Compilers Existing languages for parallel programming scalable parallel systems are primitive and hard use They are primitive the sense that each one reflects the architecture the target machine for which intended making programs written for current parallel systems highly machine dependent result there protection the programming investment parallel machines program written for one target machine may need completely rewritten when the next generation machine available This situation the principal impediment widespread use scalable parallel systems for science and engineering problems address this problem researchers have developed Fortran set extensions Fortran and Fortran that permit the programmer specify machine independent way how distribute program principal data structures among the processors parallel system addition Fortran makes programming easier than with explicit message passing because programmers can write codes that use shared name space independent the target architecture Programmers find shared name space easier use than distributed name space because data placement and access issues can ignored Using sophisticated compiler techniques these high level programs can compiled for both SIMD and MIMD parallel architectures The Fortran research effort has led prototype compilers for the Intel Paragon and Thinking Machines for both Fortran and Fortran addition the Fortran compiler has been ported number other machines including the Intel Paragon nCube and network workstations Compilers for other machines such the SIMD MasPar are under development The strategy for all these compilers based upon deep program analysis aggressive communication optimization advanced code generation techniques and the use sophisticated computation and communication libraries The effectiveness these methods being evaluated using suite scientific programs developed affiliated researchers Syracuse University High Performance Fortran HPF Fortran was major impetus behind the definition High Performance Fortran HPF The High Performance Fortran Forum which produced the definition HPF includes representatives from industry academia and government laboratories The Fortran compilers produced part the Rice Compiler Group are being used models for several commercial HPF compilers Thus the project has established efficient technology transfer mechanism which new features Fortran once demonstrated may included future round HPF definition HPF home page Irregular Problems The Fortran group also works closely with applications scientists and engineers working irregular scientific problems such computational fluid dynamics computational chemistry computational biology structural mechanics and electrical power grid calculations Key aspects the research associated with irregular scientific problems focuses the development portable runtime support libraries which coordinate interprocessor data movement manage the storage and access copies off processor data support shared name space and couple runtime data and workload partitioners compilers These runtime support libraries are being used port application codes variety multiprocessor architectures and are being incorporated into the Fortran distributed memory compilers For list technical papers irregular problems see the System Technical Papers Web pages The System researchers Rice University set out under ARPA funding build suite prototype tools that support development programs Fortran abstract machine independent parallel programming language The tools emerging from this research are collectively being called the System date research has focused four key areas intelligent editor for Fortran that provides feedback the analysis and parallelization performed Fortran compiler developed Rice advances automatic data distribution research performed Rice joint work performance analysis Fortran programs with collaborators the University Illinois and overhaul and integration program analysis repository with the interprocedural analysis system provide firm basis for the development efficient whole program analysis tools System home page The System grew out collection tools called ParaScope which was initially designed support development Fortran programs with explicit parallelism the form parallel loops One difference between ParaScope and the System that ParaScope focuses shared memory machines whereas the System targeted distributed shared memory DSM machines ParaScope home page Related Projects Members the Fortran group are involved several additional collaborations that are capitalizing the available software infrastructure For instance researchers Rice University and Argonne National Laboratory are continuing enhance ADIFOR automatic differentiation tool for Fortran built upon the ParaScope infrastructure support sensitivity analysis large simulation codes for use multidisciplinary design optimization members the CRPC Parallel Optimization group ADIFOR home page The Massively Scalar Compiler Project MSCP Rice exploiting the interprocedural analysis engine developed for ParaScope and also investigating interactions between parallelizing transformations and scalar node performance MSCP home page The Fortran group also collaborating with the CRPC Parallel Paradigm Integration project investigate ways integrating ParaScope and Fortran style data decomposition directives into Fortran modular version Fortran Syracuse University coordinating ARPA activity set Parallel Compiler Runtime Consortium This involves other sites and aims design and implement common runtime support for parallel Fortran and Ada for both data and task parallelism Finally Rice University active collaborator project the Intel Delta Consortium develop software support for parallel The Fortran project researchers will develop and implement extensions Fortran that support out core arrays which are too large fit into the main memory even massively parallel computer system People Present members the Fortran Tools effort include Vikram Adve Alan Carle Keith Cooper Ken Kennedy
