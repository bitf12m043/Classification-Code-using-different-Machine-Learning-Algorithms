Department Computer Science the University Massachusetts Unlike traditional data networks future broadband ISDN BISDN wide area networks will required carry broad range traffic classes ranging from bursty variable rate sources such voice and variable rate coded video smooth constant bit rate sources Moreover these networks will have while providing guaranteed performance quality service QOS these traffic classes The problem characterizing performance such networks thus particularly important since this must done not only for the traditional off line tasks dimensioning and design determining link bandwidths buffer capacities and processing capacities network switchpoints but also for line performance driven traffic control purposes such session level admission control this section outline our research aimed providing the analytical tools and techniques for analyzing such networks and their diverse workloads and for designing and characterizing the properties scheduling policies these networks Traditional approaches towards performance evaluation communication networks are generally not applicable high speed network environment for number reasons First the traffic future high speed networks projected bursty often processing complex correlations the cell arrival processes Simple Markovian assumptions such memoryless inter arrival times are thus likely invalid such networks The gigabit rates future high speed networks also render simulation ineffective for systems any realistic size The very performance metric interest high speed network will also different average delay will longer the primary performance measure and instead secondary performance measures such probability buffer overflow maximum packet delay and the tail delay distributions must considered this respect there evidence that even relatively sophisticated performance models which work well for predicting average delay the presence correlated arrivals may less well suited for computing these new performance measures interest Naga also note that many previous performance evaluation techniques have been confined studying the performance the aggregate traffic generated set identical sources single multiplexer isolation connection oriented high speed networks with QOS guarantees clear that performance must examined per session basis and network setting Kuro Schu Finally note that given the potentially complex nature network traffic becoming increasingly valuable able broadly characterize properties such optimality near optimality network control mechanisms which hold over wide range traffic models and assumptions Thus far however little work has been reported this problem for traditional networks much less for high speed networks Given the above considerations evident that new performance evaluation techniques will required for the design and analysis future high speed networks Furthermore given the QOS requirements such emerging standards ATM these techniques will also needed for line performance driven traffic control purposes such session level admission control Our research these areas aimed addressing this need Our research divides broadly into four areas are developing methodology for obtaining tight pessimistic bounds the per session performance collection heterogeneous sessions within high speed network Kuro The metrics interest are the distribution the packet delay and the probability buffer overflow Our research unique that are interested computing provable performance bounds and doing per session basis very general network setting which sessions may traverse number hops This methodology useful not only for the purpose analyzing session and network level performance but also mechanism used for call admission where performance QOS guarantees are provided conjecture that the bounds computed using the above methodology may sometimes too loose practical interest these cases will interest compute performance albeit approximate manner once again network setting have thus also examined number approximate approaches towards evaluating the performance heterogeneous sessions within high speed network Schu Naga Schu The primary performance metric interest probability buffer overflow Our research here noteworthy considering heterogeneous sources and doing network setting have developed methodology for designing and analyzing the qualitative behavior scheduling policies This based sample path analysis and the theory majorization Tows Our focus wide class performance metrics including the average and maximum packet delay the probability buffer overflow and the length buffer overflow burst discussed above this work particular interest and value that can characterize properties scheduling mechanisms such their optimality near optimality over wide range assumptions thus obviating the need for potentially time consuming and difficult case case performance analysis are also developing routing policies for high speed networks Hwan Hwan Given the need provide QOS guarantees admitted sessions and thus implicitly reserve resources for going calls the routing problem high speed networks shares much more common with circuit switched routing algorithms than with routing traditional data communication networks Our research Hwan Hwan aimed exploiting the similarities with routing traditional circuit switched networks and adapting these policies for the case high speed ATM networks particular interest the fact that ATM routing will more processing intensive Hwan and will required route traffic
