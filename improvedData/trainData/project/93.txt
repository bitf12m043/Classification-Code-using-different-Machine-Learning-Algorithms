Recognition group CIM Here special link ROBODAEMON put place for the McGill anniversary Open House The mobile robotics and shape recognition group informal grouping people and projects the centre The group has least three mobile robots sporting collection sensors including sonar video BIRIS and infra red reflectance depending the current experiments progress The primary computing resources are SGI Indigos and INDYs some SUN sparc and few other computing devices integrated into the general CIM computing environment Last update October This group involved issues form representation and discovery This relates specifically the exploration and representation unknown environments using mobile robots and the representation and recognition objects Key technical foci are the abstraction shape models across scale the relationship between signals and symbolic descriptions Some the problems are interested include the following How can moving observer such robot recognize where How can build but virtual reality model its world for use human operator this important for tasks such remote inspection How can robot learn efficiently about where How can group robots collaboate efficiently typical prosaic objective create robot than can learn your office over the weekend delivered Friday you open the box leave the floor and home Monday morning the robot would have explored the office and would able carry out delivery and search tasks Get mail and find Mary and escort her the conference room Note this page informally maintained Professor Gregory Dudek from the School Computer Science and

information Dudek collaboration with Professors Milios and Jenkin York and Wilkes Ontario Hydro Autonomous navigation using sensory information often depends usable map the environment This work deals with the automatic creation such maps autonomous agent and the minimal requirements such map must satisfy order useful One aspect this work the analysis how uncertainty either the map sensing devices relates the reliability and cost navigation and and path planning Another aspect the development sensing strategies and behaviours that facilitate reliable self location and map construction Probabilistic sonar understanding Simon Lacroix Grogory Dudek Pose Estimation From Image Data Without Explicit Object Models Dudek Chi Zhang consider the problem locating robot initially unfamiliar environment from visual input The robot not given map the environment but does have access limited set training examples each which specifies the video image observed when the robot particular location and orientation Such data might acquired using dead reckoning the first time the robot entered unfamiliar region using some simple mechanism such sonar avoid collisions this paper address specific variant this problem for experimental and expository purposes how estimate robot orientation pan and tilt from sensor data Performing the requisite scene reconstruction needed construct metric map the environment using only video images difficult avoid this using approach which the robot learns convert set image measurements into representation its pose position and orientation This provides local metric description the robot relationship portion larger environment large scale map might then constructed from collection such local maps the case our experiment these maps express the statistical relationship between the image measurements and camera pose The conversion from visual data camera pose implemented using multi layer neural network that trained using backpropagation For extended environments separate network can trained for each local region The experimental data reported this paper for orientation information pan and tilt suggests the accuracy the technique good while the line computational cost very low Spatial abstraction and mapping Mackenzie Dudek This project involves the development formalism and methodology for making the transition from raw noisy sensor data collected roving robot map composed object models and finally simple abstract map described terms discrete places interest important early stage such processing the the ability select
