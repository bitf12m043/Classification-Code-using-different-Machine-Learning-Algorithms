more When programmer writes program she actually constructing model process for doing something such model called algorithm Furthermore the programmer concerned not only with whether the program simply works but also with how well works and how interacts with both users and other programs This class designed mainly teach you the art computer programming that end shall try develop you sense style and aesthetics that will help guide your programming efforts and shall try develop your intuition about how things work and why You will learn some the design principles that into the engineering good programs shall teach you little computer science give you way analyzing your programs and your algorithms and finding the means improve them You will learn number standard algorithms and some programming idioms standard ways performing certain kinds tasks any programming need choose language Whichever choose the language does not place limits what our programs can but only what they look like provides with framework which organize our ideas about processes and problem solving The programming language use this class Scheme have chosen because provides convenient mechanism for describing most the idioms and processes that programmers have found useful won spend much time teaching the details the language because don have you will find that easy pick along often helpful first program using simple powerful language like Scheme even one must then translate the solution into more traditional programming language like The simplicity Scheme allows treat many computer science topics more depth than would possible were used for traditional languages more inessential detail must mastered Scheme allows give better impression the true joys and challenges programming Then you will better position study your next computer science course Finally computer programming still fairly young field and hasn lost its sense fun for lots people including hope that you will enjoy much Goals the end the course student can expected know the following concepts and able write good Scheme programs The students should able use the following data types symbols numbers booleans lists vectors and matrices strings and characters The students should know how write programs recursive iterative and imperative styles Students should able write recursive programs lists both those containing only top level items and those containing nested sublists tree recursion The students should able use procedures first class objects that pass them arguments and also write programs whose values are procedures This includes the currying and composing procedures The students should understand the concept scope and environment They should able use locally defined procedures Students should able use abstraction both with data making programs independent the data representation and also with procedures abstracting the structure programs Students should able use the input and output routines and write convenient user interfaces for their programs Students should able handle the binary representation numbers Students should know some the standard sorting routines insertion sort mergesort and quicksort log and understand the advantages and disadvantages each They should also able write both linear and binary search programs Students should know how mutate various data structures including lists vectors strings addition they should understand side effecting variables Students should able read programs and have appreciation what constitutes good programming style They should aware the relative efficiency programs Certain topics will included time permits These include such things writing and using syntactic extensions developing object oriented programming package Scheme and using streams Literate programming Every programmer knows that programs must comprehensible the computer The programming language implementation complains when they are not But with some practice generally easy solve such problems What less appreciated that programs must also comprehensible the programmer Otherwise the programmer cannot have any confidence that the program correct program may easily comprehensible the computer but not what intended and only the programmer knows what intended most cases also essential that programs comprehensible other programmers Though this not typical student programming experience the real world programmers spend most their time modifying huge programs that were developed over long period time many other programmers Modifying someone else code even your own few months later may joy nightmare depending how clearly the program written Thus emphasize the importance literate programming writting programs that are easy understand relative the difficulty the problem they solve Literate programming almost always more important than other programming goals such efficiency and code compactness though efficiency and compactness are often byproducts literate programming Course Materials Required Springer and Friedman Scheme and the Art Programming MIT Press McGraw Hill will cover most the first three quarters this text The source code available course packet available The White Rabbit Indiana Ave This packet contains tutorial the software systems the course uses and the first assignment Recommended Friedman and Felleisen The Little Schemer Fourth Edition MIT Press This little book the best introduction recursive programming that know and designed for self study Recursion used throughout this course but some students require extra material before they feel comfortable using you are having any difficulty mastering recursion strongly recommend that you get this book and study your own Interpreters for Macs and PCs There fairly beautiful Scheme package available for MacIntosh and less beautiful one for DOS Syllabus and Lecture Scripts Most the first three quarters the text Scheme and the Art Programming will covered Approximately one week will devoted each the chapters listed below The links the following list are script files that drive the line lecture presentations The script file for chapter may also accessed the machine copper the file www scriptn Prof Leone uses separate script for each lecture based the scripts below sometimes with more examples Chapter Data and operators Emacs Keybindings Chapter Procedures and recursion Chapter Data abstraction and numbers Chapter Data driven recursion Chapter Locally defined procedures poly alg poly rep poly rep Binary Notation Chapter Interactive programming Chapter Abstracting procedures Chapter Using vectors Chapter Sorting and searching Chapter Mutation Chapter Object oriented programming Assignments programming assignment will due almost every week The assignments will appear below they are assigned Assignment also available plain text the file www anF txt Links answer files with names the form www ansnF will added appropriate Assignment Due Answers Getting started Simple procedures Answers Simple recursion Answers More recursion Answers Deep recursion Fri Answers Iteration Answers Locally defined procedures and polynomials Answers Binary Numbers Data Abstraction and Trees Answers Encodings and Interactive Programming Fri Answers Procedures Arguments and Building Huffman Trees Answers Procedural Abstraction Strings and Vectors Tue submitted all programs must run under Chez Scheme recommended that you use the UCS University Computing Services machines named copper and zinc New students should have Network and instructions for creating copper and zinc accounts soon you have your account you should configure run emacs Scheme within emacs and the handin program This done entering setup hitting return and logging out You only have this once When you login the next time your account will configured for You have configure both your copper and zinc accounts Assignments will posted before Wednesday afternoon and will due electronically the Wednesday the following week Any written material will due the beginning the lecture that Thursday Friday Late assignments will not accepted computing the semester assignment average the lowest assignment grade will dropped Although assignments count for only the final grade essential that you the assignments master the material Computer programming like playing musical instrument can only mastered through lots practice Programming assignments are submitted using the program handin the directory bin copper and zinc The handin program evaluates and grades your program behavior and the results are returned you almost immediately via email Since zinc allows mail sent but not received you will have read the grading results the machine where you normally read your mail You may correct and resubmit your programs many five times until the announced deadline The highest grade recorded for the assignment will the one that entered into the class gradebook this course you may discuss assignments with other students not assume this true all your courses expect you actually think through and fully understand assignment solutions have found that students who copy someone elses work and turn something they not fully understand usually fail the examinations and the added having good assignment grades insufficient pass the course Teamwork doing assignments good long each member the team contributes and fully understands the programs This certainly means that you should not put your name file written someone else and submit your own work After the final submission assignment will not only electronically graded but Associate Instructor will also grade the assignment for style Good programming style makes easier get your programs working and also develops the habit literate programming which have already noted great importance developing large programs this course good style also rewarded the evaluation exams For Scheme programming consistent use suitable style program indentation essential and violation the first cardinal rule indentation will automaticaly result loss credit Communication The course newsgroups csci and csci will used post announcements such assignments exams and any exceptions our usual office hours You are also encouraged use post questions related the course share related information with the class Make habit looking for new notes few times each week individual personal matters please feel free contact your instructor associate instructor via email Another newsgroup you should check
