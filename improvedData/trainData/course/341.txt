Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman Foundations Computer Science Edition Computer Science Press New York Course Description Almost every course computer science uses concepts from mathematics the aim this course present many the mathematical topics that are frequently encountered while learning computer science Those who have taken using Scheme know the importance recursion programming start examining more detail the concept recursion Chapter entitled Iteration Induction and Recursion preparation for study the analysis algorithms shall look the big notation Chapter Throughout mathematics find that graphical representation ideas make them easier comprehend The same true computer science and next Chapter discuss special graphs called trees they are used data model computing Sets are another important mathematical concept underlying much computer science and these are treated Chapter Those who work database theory know the importance the relational databases next study functions and relations from set theoretic point view Chapter presents more general discussion graph theory than the previous discussion trees Logic underlies all computer science next cover propositional logic which makes Chapters and Aho and Ullman time permits the last part the course shall investigate finite state automata way modeling computation This material contained Chapter time permits shall also discuss Turing machines and the halting problem Note that have skipped many the chapters our text shall also skip over many the sections within chapters This text designed for year long course which introduces students not only the fundamental ideas underlying computer science but also the important data structures used computing would nice have enough time during the semester cover the whole text but since this not the case and since the material that skip interesting you might consider reading some the sections chapters skip get head start for some the future courses Homework assignments will posted the class web page regularly usually due the next discussion section Late assignments will not accepted Please write your solutions the problems way that will easy for the graders read and understand Presentation the answers significant factor grading homework this course you may discuss assignments with other students not assume this true all your courses expect you actually think through and fully understand assignment solutions have found that students who copy someone else work and turn something they not fully understand usually poorly the examinations which carry much more weight grading Teamwork doing assignments good long each member the team contributes and fully understands the assignment you are working with group please indicate your homework papers someone has given you lot help acknowledge them you will not penalized and they will get the thanks they deserve Study Aids template for regular induction template for strong induction AssignmentsNo late assignments will accepted find out discuss your FINAL Letter GRADE send email mjahn indiana edu Michael Jahn jnewkir indiana edu James Newkirk Communication The course newsgroup will used post

Exam special assignments projects will given help students raise their grades PoliciesAcademic Integrity Read the Computer Science Department Statement Academic Integrity sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate Cases academic dishonesty will reported the Office Student Ethics branch the Office the Dean Students Withdrawal May the last day until drop course withdraw from all courses with automatic After that date student may withdraw only with the permission his her dean This approval normally only for urgent reasons related extended illness equivalent distress June the last day for deans approve course drop Incomplete grade incomplete final grade will given only prior arrangement exceptional circumstances conforming university and departmental policy which requires among other things that the student must have completed the bulk the work required for the course with passing grade and that the remaining work can made within days after the end the semester these conditions cannot met withdrawal the appropriate course action Special accomodation Students who need any special accommodation must contact the the professor during the first week class discuss arrangements Questions you have questions about any these policies please ask the instructor This page was posted May
