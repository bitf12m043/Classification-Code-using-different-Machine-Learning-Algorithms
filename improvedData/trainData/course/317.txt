Trailer Can computer taught read words aloud recognize faces perform medical diagnosis drive car play game balance pole predict physical phenomena The answer all these yes All these applications and others have been demonstrated using varieties the computational model known neural networks the subject this course The course will develop the theory number neural network models Participants will exercise the theory through both pre developed computer programs and ones their own design Course Personnel Instructor Robert Keller Olin MTuW appt keller muddcs Tutor Grader Kelly tkelly muddcs

Company Boston ISBN which will call NND below Supplementary references which will provided necessary Related WWW links for self study and research appear below Software which installed muddcs hmc edu MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox The MathWorks Inc Matlab Neural Network StuffMatlab cross referenced SNNS Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator Course Requirements There will some homework and programming assignments but exams These assignments will constitute about the grade The other the grade from substantial final project involving either working neural network application research paper The grade the project will determined the comprehensiveness and degree which you explored competing approaches The projects will presented orally Optional voluntary oral presentations textbook material can also made during the term These can act cushion your grade They are very much encouraged they really help you learn the material higher level than you would otherwise Please see you are interested making

additional but related topics are assuming the previous material hasn expanded time significantly Whether does remains seen some these topics may compressed eliminated Week Genetic programming and connection NNs Other topics related Alife Artificial Life Week Fuzzy logic and its connection NNs Auxiliary References not required Simon Haykin Neural networks comprehensive foundation Macmillan This book was used the previous offering the course includes topics such radial basis function networks and temporal approaches which are not present the main textbook However the mathematics more difficult follow Mohamad Hassoun Fundamentals artificial neural networks MIT Press This another fairly thorough introduction James Anderson introduction neural networks MIT Press This more gentle introduction the topic one the pioneers the field Irwin Levitan and Leonard Kaczmarek The Neuron Oxford University Press This book focuses the biology and physics neurons Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert Perceptrons expanded addition MIT Press The historical importance this book will discussed the course Duda and Hart Pattern classification and scene analysis Wiley This book gives broad look
