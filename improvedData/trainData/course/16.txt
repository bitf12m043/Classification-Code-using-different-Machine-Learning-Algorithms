hours Mon Thu Course Description Parallel machines are here stay This underscored the fact that all system manufacturers offer multiprocessors the top their product line However the debate how the parallel machines the future will look like has heated considerably the past few months the federal spending cuts are their way eradicate the performance any price massively parallel processor MPP manufacturers Competitors having bet glorified workstation farms are smiling while their machines cannot offer the same level performance ease use their business has not suffered much because these machines are more price competitive and can leverage the latest microprocessor developments more quickly the core the technological debate lie large number systems issues how integrate large number off the shelf processors into cost effective system which can easily programmed high level parallel programming languages and which can host varied application workload This course not about how program parallel machines although some that will the topic the first few weeks Parallel algorithms languages and architectures have matured considerably over the last few years the point where parallel machines are almost usable only the system support were adequate allow general purpose use This course will focus the architecture and operating system aspects required support features taken for granted sequential computing such portable parallel programs powerful debuggers multi user machine access virtual memory and fast The first part the course will examine two complete parallel systems the with Split and ATM network workstations with Using vertical approach will study the interactions between algorithmic models languages associated execution models operating systems architectures and hardware implementations focussing the support required for each these layers The second part the course will focus specific topics and slice horizontally across systems selecting few key issues for analysis the design alternatives depth study the KSR and the DASH will provide some shared memory contrast the course Course MaterialsCourse formatLecture NotesProblem setsTerm

yourself through college and into the job arena Our lab sections are taught using Macintosh computers but sections using PCs are available see Using Computers Lectures The course has two components Part Lecture the lecture will discuss computers generic terms general computer science topics will discuss how computers work including the following topics not necessarily this order application programs including word processors spreadsheets graphics and databases hardware input output storage devices operating systems programming languages networks and telecommunications artificial intelligence and expert systems computer related social issues Part Lab the laboratory discussion sections you will have hands experience Macintosh IIci computers with the following programs word processing Word electronic mail newsgroups and World Wide Web Eudora and Netscape painting and drawing Aldus SuperPaint spreadsheet and charting Excel database FileMaker presentation manager HyperCard desktop publishing Aldus PageMaker integral part lab learning the Macintosh operating system System well addition there are some special tools ROM and scanners available There are TAs that teach the
