fault toleranceLorenzo AlvisiDistributed systems have moved beyond the confines academia and research labs and are revolutionizing the way which businesses governmental organizations and simple citizens are processing and collecting information Current technological trends promise dramatically increase the pace this revolution enabling the design highly cooperative distributed applications that beyond the client server paradigm harness the computational power distributed systems this new environment the scope and emphasis fault tolerant techniques are about undergo dramatic changes Fault tolerance will cease expensive feature required handful applications tolerate exotic failures the users highly distributed information infrastructure fault tolerance will translate competitive advantage guaranteeing reliable access critical information this talk will explore new way design and engineer fault tolerant solutions which call lightweight fault tolerance The goals lightweight fault tolerance are require few dedicated resources and have negligible impact performance during failure free executions scale its cost depending the severity and number failures that need tolerated integrate with applications way transparent the application programmer enable and support emerging applications that will communicate through messages well files address software generated faults effectively Cilk and Cilk NOW Adaptive and Reliable Parallel Computing Networks WorkstationsRobert BlumofeThis presentation overviews Cilk pronounced silk algorithmic parallel multithreaded language and Cilk NOW runtime system that supports functional subset Cilk networks workstations Cilk NOW provides adaptive parallelism and fault tolerance tranparently user programs Adaptive parallelism means that the set workstations which Cilk program runs can grow and shrink dynamically depending the availability idle workstations and the amount parallelism within the program addition Cilk program can continue execution even one more its workstations crashes because the Cilk NOW runtime system automatically detects and recovers from such failures The presentation includes live demonstration Distributed from Clusters InternetsMike DahlinThis presentation gives overview current issues distributed file system Technology trends and new applications motivate more aggressive cluster and wide area network systems clusters fast networks allow machines cooperate closely service requests The xFS file system uses close cooperation among nodes provide better performance and availability than single central server wide area networks the challenge provide good performance availability and consistency despite limited network performance and node network failures The wFS file system project will explore these issues The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy for Human and Robot Cognitive Maps Benjamin KuipersHuman cognitive maps rely several different representations for large scale space each with its own ontology Similarly variety different approaches have been proposed for robot exploration and mapping unknown environments cast these diverse representations into natural structure that call the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy SSH which the objects relations and assumptions each level are abstracted from the levels below Each level the SSH has its own mathematical foundation The control level allows the robot and its environment formalized continuous dynamical system whose stable equilibrium points can abstracted discrete set distinctive states Trajectories linking these states can abstracted actions giving discrete causal graph representation the state space The causal graph states and actions can turn abstracted topological network places and paths Local metrical models such occupancy grids neighborhoods places and paths can then built the framework the topological network without their usual problems global consistency Mathematical Principles Logic ProgrammingVladimir LifschitzLogic programming well its sister approach functional programming based the view that computer program does not need contain any explicit operational instructions Instead can simply provide set facts about the problem that sufficient solve Such declarative program can executed using methods automated reasoning Prolog the best known logic programming language The mathematical theory logic programming concerned with defining the semantics logic programming languages describing the reasoning algorithms used implement them and investigating the soundness these algorithms Adaptive Libraries and High Level OptimizationCalvin LinThis talk describes new approach building software libraries making libraries that can adapt both their implementation and their interfaces different application needs and different hardware platforms can produce libraries that are more efficient and more widely usable describe new framework for building such libraries describe three planned experiments that apply these techniques libraries for parallel scientific computation and explain how our approach facilitates high level optimizations Learning Sequential Decision Tasks Through Symbiotic Evolution Neural NetworksRisto MiikkulainenA novel reinforcement learning method called SANE Symbiotic Adaptive Neuro Evolution evolves population neurons through genetic algorithms form neural network for given task Symbiotic evolution promotes both cooperation and specialization the population which results fast efficient genetic search and discourages convergence suboptimal solutions SANE able extract domain specific information even under sparse reinforcement which makes effective approach broad range sequential decision tasks such robot control game playing and resource management Alamo The Net Data WarehouseDan MirankerThe Alamo effort directed intra net development and inter net users who can enumerate interesting sites and data sources The goal integrate the data sources and provide the user with the illusion single virtual database followed query analysis and presentation tools Central the Alamo architecture software bus called the Abstract Search Machine ASM The ASM CORBA compliant interface that provides uniform interface heterogeneous data sources Beyond simple data access the ASM embodies higher level abstraction enabling the efficient coding clever search algorithms and separating and isolating system concerns including buffering and data prefetch The broad claim that high performance often optimal implementations advanced database facilities such object oriented query engine deductive inference engine active database engine and data mining facilities can all constructed using the ASM common interface Finally since the output each these advanced database facilities can themselves serve data sources the components the Alamo architecture can composed resolve higher level data integration problems particular anticipate using the elements Alamo itself represent meta data and resolve both structural and semantic conflicts among the data sources Ultimately further compositions will embody complex knowledge bases and able answer high level queries Learning Process Natural Language Using Inductive Logic ProgrammingRaymond MooneyInductive Logic Programming ILP addresses the problem learning Prolog programs from examples The representational power first order logic offers advantages over standard machine learning methods constrained use fixed length feature vectors are applying ILP methods natural language learning where believe this richer representation offers important advantages have developed ILP system CHILL for learning deterministic parsers from corpus parsed sentences CHILL obtains superior results several artificial corpora previously used test neural network methods and encouraging results the more realistic ATIS corpus airline queries CHILL has also been used the automatically develop complete natural language interface that translates English database queries into executable Prolog form producing more accurate parser than hand built system for querying small geographic database have also developed ILP system FOIDL which has been applied learning the past tense English surpassing the previous results neural network and decision tree methods this problem Software Reuse Specialization Generic Procedures through ViewsGordon Novak Software reuse clearly good idea but difficult achieve practice your data does not fit the assumptions the software reusing the software will difficult our approach views describe how application data types implement the abstract types used generic procedures compilation process can specialize generic procedure produce version that customized for the application data Graphical user interfaces make easy specify views Automatic Programming Server has been implemented the World Wide Web will write specialized programs for the user desired language and serve the source code the user file Analysis Algorithms Greg PlaxtonA major focus theoretical computer science the design and analysis asymptotically efficient algorithms sequential parallel distributed deterministic randomized for specific computational problems this research area not uncommon come across well written papers which informally the main underlying ideas are conceptually straightforward the formal presentation surprisingly lengthy and iii most the formalism deals with minor side issues and special cases that have little nothing with the main underlying ideas such papers there seems significant gap between the conceptual and formal difficulty the algorithm being presented Are such gaps inherent conventional mathematical notation simply inadequate for succinctly formalizing certain conceptually straightforward algorithmic ideas this talk will describe notation for asymptotic analysis called notation that significantly reduces the conceptual formal gap associated with non trivial class algorithms concrete example consider the analysis the well known linear time selection algorithm due Blum Floyd Pratt Rivest and Tarjan The Design and Evaluation Parallel AlgorithmsVijaya RamachandranThe design and analysis efficient parallel algorithms for combinatorial problems has been area extensive study recent years and large number algorithms have been developed the abstract PRAM model parallel computation this talk will describe some our work the design efficient parallel algorithms and our experience with implementing and evaluating these algorithms massively parallel machine Maspar will then describe queuing variant the PRAM model which propose more appropriate model for currently available parallel shared memory machines than traditional PRAM models Extensible Languages Open Compilers and ReflectionPaul WilsonExtensible languages allow interesting new features added language portably from within the language itself Open compilers allow fairly easy modification compilers add new features analyses and optimizations Reflection allows program examine representation interesting parts itself and affect its own structure accordingly discuss these things why they useful for building modular portable and adapatable software also discuss our recent work the RScheme compiler open compiler for extensible language
