OVERVIEW Fundamental advances computing performance are dependent adapting programming techniques new parallel computer architectures Whether meet real time constraints improve response times for computationally intensive tasks model physically parallel systems parallel programming techniques should useful students and professionals wide variety disciplines advanced undergraduates CIS graduate students computing systems engineers building embedded systems and scientists doing theoretical calculations could benefit from this course The goal this course build the knowledge data structures and algorithms from CIS expose the student fundamental concepts concurrent and distributed programming LECTURES Nichols MWF INSTRUCTORS Matthew Dwyer and Virgil Wallentine Office Nichols Email dwyer cis ksu edu WWW http www cis ksu edu dwyer Phone Fax Office Hours amPREREQUISITES CIS REQUIREMENTS The course will consist lectures readings programming projects and exams Lectures Readings The bulk the concepts the course will presented explained and illustrated way extended examples the lectures The readings serve provide more details and depth selected concepts Lectures and readings function integrated presentation the course material expected that you will have completed each reading prior the appropriate lecture Take advantage class time ask questions and elaborate issues that were presented the readings HomeworksThere will programming projects You will working with three different languages Multi Pascal Concurrent and Ada The programming projects are designed provide depth exposure the concepts covered the course The use different languages will help illustrate the variety different solution strategies that are possible There are group projects this class all students are expected their own work You may discuss the projects with other students but you may not share designs code data modules objects documentation specification requirements interfaces Please refer the KSU Campus Phone book which contains the Student Life Handbook You are governed these guidelines and procedures take note the following passage instructor who convinced that she has evidence plagiarism cheating should first decide the appropriate punishment The instructor may impose punishment ranging from credit for the work exam the class The instructor may recommend dismissal suspension but that recommendation can only carried out the Undergraduate Grievance Board minimum credit will given for the work exam which dishonesty occurred The instructor may draft memo for the student record kept the provost office until graduation indicating the nature the dishonest act ExaminationsThere will hour class mid term exam and hour class comprehensive final exam Final grades will assigned based the following weighting homeworks mid term and final READINGS The required readings for this course include text book and selected papers from the literature These papers are

other parallel programming pages ORGANIZATION SCHEDULE The course broken into two phases the first phase will covering material the Lester text This will provide you with solid background the fundamentals parallel programming the second phase will cover number additional topics related parallel programming that will build off this foundation Professor Wallentine will lecture during the first phase the course and Professor Dwyer will lecture during the second phase Professor Dwyer will hold the office hours for the course The course will cover the following topics Motivation for Parallel Programming Why parallelism When should use Disjoint Parallel ProcessesHow break problem into sub problems that can solved independetly Basic concepts Shared Memory Systems Multiprocessor
