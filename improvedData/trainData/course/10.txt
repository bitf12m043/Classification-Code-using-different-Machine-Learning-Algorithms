Prerequisites TextBook Information Grading Professor Teaching Assistants Course Description being offered for the first time Fall intended give students solid background the design and development database management systems DBMS Database systems are possibly the world largest pieces software and certainly among the most valuable pieces software While DBMS one sense giant application program there are surprisingly many principles behind its development and use The database industry growing and thriving and the demand for knowledgeable database engineers much greater than the supply The database research community also active and there are always new problems addressed because the explosive amounts data that people wish access This course forms essential background for anyone who wants become systems engineer database development company become informed user database systems become database systems researcher develop systems any domain that manipulate large amounts data find out how teller machine really works number advanced fundamental DBMS concepts will covered Although this not intended introductory course new course and there may students the class with different backgrounds Consequently the discussion various topics will begin with quick review basic material taught Click here for tentative list topics covered terms workload here what the course involves There will midterm and final examination These will test breadth basic concepts Each student will have survey paper specific advanced topic Here list possible topics The purpose this aware that what being taught the course only fraction what out there This paper will due three weeks after the midterm and should complete with references will require reading papers from journals and conference proceedings the engineering library will suggest initial references and you will have pursue additional references from there Click here for information reference material the library development project involving programming Look here for more information There will written homework assignments Students take turns writing lecture notes Depending enrollment this means each person will have take notes once twice the semester Hopefully this additional work will turn out useful around exam time Here are the details Development Project The term project important part the course and will involve significant amount programming You can choose whether you wish work alone teams two However the two person projects will involve proportionally more work The goal the project two fold get hands experience building some specific DBMS component get comfortable working with large pre existing code base and modifying modular manner The second goal important the first one because all database systems are huge software systems and rarely you have the luxury starting from scratch This forces you write modular code and also understand the interaction between the different system components when the inevitable bugs appear There are two research DBMS prototypes that will used the projects One MINIBASE which software associated with the textbook simple single user database system that provides all the components from the SQL parser down the disk manager This should hopefully available depending our being able compile and run our computing environment The important part MINIBASE the interface description the various system components The actual code comes from class projects Consequently projects using MINIBASE will involve writing component like the buffer manager based specification its interface The other prototype PREDATOR which query processing engine that have been developing for research There are number possible projects some which could lead research topics that can built top PREDATOR The focus here the high end functionality like complex queries and new data types you are not familiar with recommend MINIBASE project because the amount design needed minimal you think you are interested database systems research then you should PREDATOR project you fall neither category then you should decide whether you want project the lower level DBMS storage access buffer areas the higher level query processing optimization areas and choose between MINIBASE lower level and PREDATOR higher level There are also some general projects that involve neither system you have your own idea suitable project you should talk with about well advance the project proposal date Here tentative list possible projects all the projects there will certain steps that should followed part the project proposal you should discuss with and submit ordered list pieces functionality that the project will produce There will mid project review which you meet with discuss the progress that you have made towards completing the project The code you write must follow the coding conventions the particular system that you are working detailed coding conventions document will provided and should followed closely This something that will very picky and that will contribute the grade you get the project Project submission should include demo and reasonable amount test data Some useful references are Home page for PREDATOR Home page for MINIBASE Course TextBook The primary text beta edition new book database systems Database Management Systems Raghu Ramakrishnan This book contains many more details than are most other introductory database books also associated with free software for instructional database system MINIBASE which might use class assignments The textbook available the campus store for Here are other textbooks which could used references Korth Silberschatz Database System Concepts McGraw Hill Second Edition This the standard introductory database text but lacks the detail used graduate course Michael Stonebraker Readings Database Systems Morgan Kaufmann Second Edition This collection relatively recent papers the area collected and introduced Stonebraker who developed the Ingres Postgres and Illustra database systems Many these are fundamental papers core areas Elmasri Navathe Fundamentals Database Systems Benjamin Cummings Second Edition This alternative introductory database text Gray Reuter Transaction Processing Concepts and Techniques Morgan Kaufmann This the bible transaction processing pages long and tells you all there know and lot more about transactions wonderful reference clear confusing aspects concurrency control recovery transaction semantics etc Some reference material has also been placed the library Click here for details Information Here are some resources about programming Tutorial The language under construction Debugging with gdb GNU Make Grading Policies The grades for the course will assigned based the following percentages Prelim mid term exam Final exam Survey paper Lecture Notes Term project The prelim exam will the evening Oct Upson will set comfortably finished hrs but extra half hour will provided for those who need Likewise for the final exam The final should exam period Thurs Dec but this again tentative and needs confirmed The final exam will focus material not tested the mid term but the material covered the earlier part the course may form background for some the questions Professor Praveen Seshadri Office Upson Phone Mail praveen Office Hours Tuesday and

from home Click here send mail Problem Solving Exercises One the most important skills you will learn this class problem solving Good problem solving skills distinguish good computer programmer from bad one doesn matter how familiar skilled you are particular programming language you not understand how solve the problem then you will not able write computer program for any language help you learn problem solving skills and techniques will assign weekly problem solving exercises These will small but non trivial problems which will give out each Monday You should look the problem and think about during the week and right down the steps you would through solve the problem the overall structure your program This primarily exercise general problem solving you not have write any FORTRAN code
