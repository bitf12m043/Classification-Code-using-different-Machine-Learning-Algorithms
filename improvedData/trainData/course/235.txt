read understand write and evolve typical small higher level programs Course Goals this class expect students learn what makes computer science how write simple programs the Ada programming language and how solve problems using computer This class has prerequisites Another document gives more detailed list topics covered this class Students often come with wide variety backgrounds and vastly different experience consequence some students may bored and some may lost Your patience support your classmates and participation class are appreciated Textbook The textbook for this class the Nell
