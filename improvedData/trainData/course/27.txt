own midterm Assignment Assignment now ready Notes notation and Binary Search The notes notation and Binary Search are now available you want print either one them open the File menu from the Ghostview window that shows you the document and choose the Print menu item Women Computer Science Some female faculty graduate students and undergraduates have formed group called WICS Women Computer Science One the group goals encourage more women become computer science majors there are any women this class who would like talk someone about majoring computer science doing graduate studies computer science there are any women who would like some extra help with their classwork they should see Suzan computer science grad student during her office hours email her make appointment Suzan mail address stodder wisc edu and her office hours are Tuesday Thursday room Assignment Assignment now ready Out Town The first week classes will out town the VLDB Conference Jim Larus will give the lectures for will class September Teaching Assistants Both people listed below are teaching assistants TAs for the course They will grading your homework assigments and will happy answer questions about the assignments any other aspect the course that giving you trouble Note that TAs are not assigned specific sections Chin Tang Chin Office Computer Sciences Office hours Monday Tuesday Friday

required your programming assignments didn choose just make your life more difficult Most people who become fluent think far superior Pascal the use growing tremendously the field and the odds are that you ever have write another program after this course ends you will able write The same statement not true about Pascal also widely available but after initial startup period you will more productive than you take more computer science courses with few exceptions you will required use those courses Text The text book for this course Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Walls and Mirrors Frank Carrano ISBN This well written text that covers most but not all the material this course also includes lot about separate text for the language not necessary For lectures will often but not always following Lecture Notes Fall David DeWitt These notes are actually considerably more complete that simple lecture notes but they are still short true text book there very little narrative text exercises etc recommended additional source you may want purchase these notes which are available from the DoIT documentation desk near the Dayton Street entrance the Computer Sciences building Dayton this the first experience with Unix for you you will need some information about activating your account logging creating editing and manipulating files and compiling running and debugging programs The handout available from the DoIT information desk where the DeWitt notes are available contains all the key information You will find invaluable See also the help section below mentioned above the lectures will often follow the DeWitt notes although may supplement them with few handouts during the course the semester Nonetheless You are responsible for all material covered lecture The exams will based the lecture material reading assignments the notes and the course assignments Grading There will one two evening exams during the course the semester final exam and five programming assignments The exams will determine the final grade with approximately equal weight for each one and the programming assignments will count for each Exams Exam Tuesday October Chemistry Exam TBA Final Exam Wednesday December place TBA Course Schedule The following the list topics that will covered this course more detailed scheduled will provided later semester TOPIC DEWITT NOTES WALLS AND

necessity get grade other than Bring photograph you should not your picture from your birthday nor should the one from that boy girl scout trip the summer Other than that can color black and white any size etc grade will given without photo Programming Assignments Proficiency programming language Pascal FORTRAN the introductory level assumed the equivalent Madison prerequisite course Assignments must done the designated machines These are the machine rooms the first floor the building encourage you use these machines you prefer use home computer you may with certain restrictions You must have compiler your home machine you must log your university account often read email and get copies data files finally will require that you turn your program electronically via email you work home you must make provisions download your programs your university account and make sure that they compile and run with the compiler the SPARCstations often use electronic mail notify students changes assignments hints for programs etc assume that you will read all electronic mail that send Late PolicyNo late assignment will accepted Assignments must turned exactly when they are due order avoid lateness caused machine loads coincident due dates for several classes etc simply sure get started right away each assignment Things are certain wrong now and then don wait until the last minute start Any exceptions must approved and you will need very good excuse you get into trouble see soon possible Cheating The Computer Science department takes very hard line stance cheating You are welcome communicate with each other design algorithms and data structures but there sharing code You are also expected learn understand and obey the Computer Systems Lab Policies governing your computer accounts Help you are having problems with the course work programs please let know early the semester possible Office Hours Policies you need help debugging program the best way get help visit any one the during his office hours taking along current hard copy your program office hours are intended time for explain concepts that have presented class but about which you are still confused answer your specific questions about course material encourage you use email reliable way contact about any problems read and respond email several times daily almost every day the week Program Grading Programs are graded all the following criteria Correctness The program should behave correctly normally typical input The program should behave stated the project specifications Clarity The program should easy read and understand See the notes style below for more information about clarity Robustness Correct behavior extreme unusual situations The program should handle such situations reasonable and logical manner that should not simply blow Quality test data The test data for the program should demonstrate all facets the program capabilities including unusual cases Efficiency Avoid unnecessarily inefficient algorithms constructs However efficiency should never pursued the expense clarity Modularity The program should modular and should make effective use parameters Completeness You should incorporate all information into your program there should need for any sort extra paper documentation Generality The program should general possible subject consideration efficiency and clarity You should avoid arbitrary limitations such bound the size complexity the input whenever possible When limitations are necessary they should expressed defined constants near the top the program that they can easily changed The only numeric literals that should appear your program are those values not very likely change such Style Use meaningful identifier names Use consistent naming scheme for identifier names suggested convention follows int variable name int function name int argument const int DEFINED CONSTANT enum EnumType VALUE VALUE class ClassName not put multiple statements single line Skip lines between functional groups code Use clear and consistent indentation style see the DeWitt notes for suggested style Indent continued statements loops etc Line and Label meaningfully while done External Documentation This should included long comment the beginning your program addressed both the typical user and someone who wants know superficially how the program works Include your full name and student the beginning the comment Give general description what the program does Tell how use the program how call format data Give limitations bugs special features and assumptions made Describe negative well positive aspects the program you don include negatives will assume you were unaware them Information included the assignment about the problem description need not repeated but may briefly summarized for the first point above statement referring the user the assignment document then sufficient Note that this only applies the problem description Internal Documentation There are four main types internal documentation Headers Comments the headers functions classes and major data structures should describe their purpose assumptions about their parameters and the main outline any algorithms they use Declarations Comments next declaration variable data member should provide extra information not conveyed the identifier name The name variable should tell much about possible without making too long additional information can supplied comment For example int top index last element added stack You should use comments explain parameters well local variables Within segments code Tricky opaque sections code should avoided but sometimes they are necessary such cases comment can help the reader understand what going Between segments code These comments clarify the top level outline your algorithm Using Unix and Many people working with UNIX for the first time will find that takes some time become comfortable with this particularly true your only previous programming experience with Pascal using MacPascal MacIntosh strongly urge you put the time early the semester become comfortable with Unix While this time may painful time well spent Also you may wish attend UNIX tutorial They will held rooms Comp Sci two sessions each the following days TBA You will want pick copy before you The Program Development Cycle The program development cycle UNIX environment for edit your program program compile your program Wall program there are compilation errors continue run your program out inputfile outputfile look your output outputfile more outputfile there are errors break you are too tired continue print listing take home program inputfile outputfile lpr goto home debug the program gdb out run quit you done turn
