numerical computation for the mathematical computational and physical sciences and engineering Emphasis from the perspective the computer scientist Use numerical algorithms engineering practice Problems accurately computing solutions the presence rounding errors and computing discrete approximations solutions which are defined the continuum The taxonomy problem classes with methods for their solution and principles useful for analysis performance and algorithmic development Topics error analysis the solution linear and nonlinear equations interpolation and numerical differentiation the approximation integrals and the solution differential equations Prerequisites Math equivalents Materials Fall Other InformationQuarters Offered Autumn Oliger Summer Gander TTh Units May taken for
