Sparse Linear Systems Yousef Saad This intended reference work and the material covered this course not identical that the textbook Office Hours Same the home page Mon Wed Course Description This course for students the sciences and applied mathematics whose research involves solving large sparse linear systems computer and for computer scientists interested learning the computational problems encountered scientific and engineering codes Sparse linear systems occur most large scale physical modeling programs and often the setting and solution them accounts for the majority the computer time This course will focus practical methods and their computer implementation with minimal amount the underlying mathematical theory High level tools will used order quickly implement and test methods Existing software will also used whenever possible avoid building everything from scratch and learn how use existing software resources Course goals include the ability understand the influence computer architecture the choice methods and data structures the strengths and weaknesses basic methods common sources large sparse linear systems and the resulting implications for choosing methods and implementations Students will finish the semester with toolkit solvers that they can then use for solving scientific problems for probing computer architectures for obtaining deeper understanding the methods commonly used scientific computing Tentative Course Outline quick start everything you knew about solving linear systems from your linear algebra course Introduction Basic linear algebra you haven seen before Sources large sparse linear systems Computer architecture basics Data structures and stopping tests Iterative methods pre technology Linear stationary Conjugate gradients theory convergence properties Preconditioning Computational kernels and software resources Expressing iterative methods terms kernel operations Toolkits for sparse system manipulations Sparskit Sparse BLAS Packages PetsC Aztec SPLIB Templates Finding and using numerical software from the Net Iterative methods recent technology Basic derivation ideas orthogonalization restarts truncation normal equations Generalized Conjugate Residuals Orthomin GCR Generalized Minimal Residuals GMRES conjugate gradients squared Stab QMR Preconditioning and related ideas Scaling equilibration Incomplete factorization Polynomial methods and preconditioning Other preconditioning methods Crafting solution strategy Choice solvers Choice preconditioners Choice stopping test Reading the literature judicious use jaundiced eye Class Newsgroup The course newsgroup csci will used post announcements assignments corrections and any exceptions usual office hours Use post questions related the course share related information with the class You are responsible for checking the newsgroup frequently since any changes corrections assignments will appear there Grading Policies Grades are based projects involving writing and analyzing computer programs Written reports are required for these projects Each assignment will have questions intended begin your thinking process not end Grading will also based the questions you raise and answer these projects For example the question Which the methods and faster simply saying not sufficient You should also ask the underlying question What measure fast appropriate here Why faster etc Most projects you can tackle groups However you must give full attribution for any outside sources you use for ideas software help Also reserve the right call any member the group present explain defend justify the group work and base the entire group grade that member performance careful who you team with Cheating Don You can get away with virtually any lifting scavenging material provided you cite the source your citation photocopied another student write then you won get many points the assignment but least you won branded with scarlet and tarred and feathered Assignments Assignments will given often total will given depending the chunk size each one Assignment Assignment Assignment Assignment sure make the modifications that were specified class lecture designed make your life easier Assignment Assignment GMRES Assignment projectors Assignment the composite step CGSTAB algorithm Chan and Szeto Lecture Notes This not full complete set lecture notes the words not great philosopher You had there you miss lecture sure check with other students the class for what went These are Postscript since latex html still not snuff for papers
