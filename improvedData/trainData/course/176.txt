Monday Location MCS Credit May taken audit for credits Course Description This seminar will take hands approach examining the design current networked computing systems particular will adopt our case study the software system associated with World Wide Web server The course will consist code walk throughs and lectures Code walk throughs will include the kernel level namely Linux the network file system and process scheduling functions and the application level one Web server Apache Lectures will cover research issues server design performance modeling and simulation techniques This seminar will prerequisite corequisite for participating the Commonwealth Server Project which being led the instructors however any student who interested studying the implementation networked computer system invited attend will asking attendees notetakers for week notetaker your job keep track the main themes the discussion and any interesting points made any the participants Participation this seminar encouragement consent one the instructors Students taking this course for credit will expected complete related project chosen consultation with one the instructors The project cannot serve also Master project however two phase proposal accepted the instructor the second phase can serve project Students may form teams work projects however the project scope must scale linearly with the team size and work must explicitly load balanced fair way also take this course for credit but use lead project during subsequent semester will schedule brownbag two the end the semester Each student participating will asked talk for short time mins their project related topic Finally for more information the Commonwealth Server Project follow this link Course Schedule Here the proposed week week schedule topics like cover During weeks through our code walkthroughs will take through version the Linux kernel see linux under course During weeks and our code walkthroughs will through version the Apache server see apache the same place you presenter scribe for particular week please mail your notes djy edu that they can linked this home page Week Research Problems Networks and Computer Systems
