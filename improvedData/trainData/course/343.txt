University Lecture Ballantine Laboratory Lindley Texts for Fall John Wakerly Microcomputer Architecture and Programming The Family Wiley CSCI packet printed locally The packet consists three documents laboratory manual programming reference guide and selected pages from Prosser and Winkel The Art Digital Design Tentative lecture schedule See the Computer Structures Course Description for more detailed outline the course content Reading assignments are mainly from Wakerly Lect Topics and Wakerly sections Introduction and background Reading assignment all chapter Pascal and data structures Pascal Refer this needed during the semester You are not required know Pascal Number systems and arithmetic Reading assignment all but Computer organization Reading assignment all chapter Addressing Reading assignment through Operations including stack machines Reading assignment through Interrupts Reading assignment all chapter Assembly language and assembly processes Reading assignment all chapter additional handouts Digital logic Reading assignment Prosser Winkel pages additional handouts Microprogrammed control and hardware design Reading assignment Microprogrammed Control Illustration manuscript handed out lecture Subroutines Reading assignment Input output Appx Serial data communication Reading assignment assigned Procedures Staff The instructor Franklin Prosser office email prosser indiana edu Office hours tentative noon and appointment and drop All The associate instructors are Jagadish Bandhole email jbandhol indiana edu Office hours and David Soruco email dsoruco indiana edu Office hours and Newsgroup The newsgroup for the sections for Fall the Computer Science departmental network will use the newsgroup heavily convey variety course information including questions and answers about lecture and laboratory procedures and problems You should check the newsgroup frequently keep date and you should feel free contribute questions and solutions about procedural problems and constructive comments Course grade class open book exams Laboratory Collected homework Homework policy Homework assignments are due class the end class the due date Late homework will not accepted The instructional staff will post solutions the class newsgroup the laboratory Lindley Hall Some questions the homework may not graded the instructors discretion However solutions all questions will posted Laboratory The lab meets Lindley Hall Your will discuss lab procedures your regular lab section You should bring lab the lab manual You will receive additional handouts and information class lab Attendance Attendance class and laboratory expected Our experience shows clear relation between good attendance and good performance Both the lectures and the laboratory sessions discuss much material that not available the textbook lab manual There will frequent handouts but without the benefit the lecture lab discussion the handouts will usually opaque Academic Integrity Read the Computer Science Department Statement Academic Integrity sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate Cases academic dishonesty will reported the Office Student Ethics branch the Office the Dean Students Withdrawal The last day drop course with automatic October After that date student may withdraw only with the permission the Dean the College Arts and Sciences This approval normally given only for urgent reasons related extended illness equivalent distress Incomplete grade incomplete final grade will given only prior arrangement exceptional circumstances conforming university and departmental policy which the bulk course work has been completed passing fashion Computer Structures Course Description students study computer systems and problem solving the context basic computer hardware and low level software systems The emphasis fundamental properties computer systems that apply across broad range computers and systems The abstractions are reinforced class and the laboratory the laboratory students extend their problem solving skills working the level computer assembly language using modern microcomputer system such the Although the class and laboratory proceed their own schedules the lab applies many the fundamental concepts dealt with lecture and the lecture provides the foundation for the lab Both class and lab emphasize disciplined structured approach programming Topics are selected from the following list Topics marked with star might included honors course Number systems and arithmetic Conversions among various number bases such decimal binary hexadecimal and arbitrary base Integer and fraction conversions Number representations for signed arithmetic signed magnitude two complement one complement floating point Computer arithmetic addition negation and subtraction simple binary multiplication floating point addition Numerical problems such overflow and loss precision Character codes
