Papadimitriou Prentice Hall Introduction Automata Theory Languages and Computation Hopcroft Ullman Addison Wesley Prerequisites enroll this course you must have satisified the following course requirements you haven done but still want remain the course please see Discrete Mathematics Programming Data Structures Topics This course core requirement undergraduate computer science curriculums most colleges Its purpose threefold first encourage you investigate the nature computation second further develop your formal reasoning and writing skills and third add new techniques your programming bag tricks Accordingly will develop several formal models computation each more powerful than the last each stage will prove some what our intuition suggests and sometimes what denies about these models will also see how most models admit two very different characterizations one machines that are able recognize certain events and another grammars that are able generate exactly what these machines recognize particular will study regular languages regular expressions finite deterministic and nondeterministic automata context free grammars pushdown automata turing machines and more time allows Grading Homeworks Midterm Thursday October Final Saturday December Note that each test worth homeworks The tests will much simpler than the homeworks Homework Assignments When writing your homework there are two goals you must keep mind first give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem and second convince the reader that your solution correct and that you know why programmer you have some experience with this sort writing effective program must written for both compiler and human reader Similarly solutions your problems must correct the sense solving the stated problem but they must also comprehensible the grader with any writing the first draft problem solution usually unpresentable All the pieces may there but they tend chaotically assembled The single most important thing you can make your solutions presentable rewrite them after you have discovered why they are correct and then throw away least tuck away your initial draft Remember scratch paper cheap careful realize that this emphasis presentation has nothing with whether English your native language whether you prefer write your solutions with pencil pen quill word processor well written solution starts stating assumptions and then works towards clearly defined goal emphasizing the overall direction and omitting the superfluous Late Policy general you will have least one week work homework assignment and least three opportunities attend office hours before that assignment due Assignments turned late for any reason will marked late and will scored their face value Assignments turned more than week after they were due will scored their face value that will still attempt evaluate them but they will not count towards your grade For excused lateness such illness and family emergency see the Grading Appeals section below Collaboration and Plagiarism col lab rate lab lab lab collaboratus collaborare labor together com laborare labor work jointly with others esp

Collaboration encouraged primarily the first and third senses when working homework problems and preparing for exams None the problems this class are intended have secret solutions the more resourceful you are discovering solutions the more time you will have write them well Indeed you are stuck problem will happy talk with you about during office hours However the solutions you turn must your original writing Copying prepared solution not collaboration all plagiarism pla gia rize pla also steal and pass off one own the ideas words another present one own idea product derived from existing source pla gia riz Plagiarizing another words not tolerated Boston University disdained that there are specific procedures for accusing and punishing those who plagiarize not copy another person work and present your own The above definitions were snatched from the Webster server Grading AppealsSimple clerical errors will corrected soon they are brought attention Perhaps you will disagree about the grading particular problem feel that instance lateness was justified order bring this attention you must prepare written appeal with supporting documents and give during the last week class will carefully consider these appeals and make reasonable adjustments your benefit when preparing the final grades This only mechanism for dealing with gradebook fair manner You are always welcome approach with your concerns you don know whether how write appeal use this guideline likely look more kindly upon That was just really bad week for than homework was always late because had headache Attendance Attendance not official part the course grade but your responsibility stay informed Some announcements will made only class Mailing List Other announcements will made only email
