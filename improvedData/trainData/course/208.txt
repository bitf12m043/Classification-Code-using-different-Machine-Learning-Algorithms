date list errors the book One copy this book will reserve the Science and Engineering library after put another copy reserve can find one You will read most the textbook this course Other Useful BooksElements the Theory Computation Lewis Papadimitriou Prentice Hall Introduction Automata Theory Languages and Computation Hopcroft Ullman Addison Wesley PrerequisitesTo enroll this course you must have satisified the following course requirements you haven done but still want remain the course please see Discrete Mathematics Programming Data Structures TopicsThis course core requirement undergraduate computer science curriculums most colleges Its purpose threefold first encourage you investigate the nature computation second further develop your formal reasoning and writing skills and third add new techniques your programming bag tricks Accordingly will develop several formal models computation each more powerful than the last each stage will prove some what our intuition suggests and sometimes what denies about these models will also see how most models admit two very different characterizations one machines that are able recognize certain events and another grammars that are able generate exactly what these machines recognize particular will study regular languages regular expressions finite deterministic and nondeterministic automata context free grammars pushdown automata turing machines and more time allows GradingThe following breakdown tentative but reasonably representative how grades will computed mentioned optional project but haven decided how fit that into the scheme yet Homeworks Midterm Thursday Final Tuesday Note that each test worth homeworks The tests will much simpler than the homeworks Homework AssignmentsWhen writing your homework there are two goals you must keep mind first give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem and second convince the reader that your solution correct and that you know why programmer you have some experience with this sort writing effective program must written for both compiler and human reader Similarly solutions your problems must correct the sense solving the stated problem but they must also comprehensible the grader with any writing the first draft problem solution usually unpresentable All the pieces may there but they tend chaotically assembled The single most important thing you can make your solutions presentable rewrite them after you have discovered why they are correct and then throw away least tuck away your initial draft Remember scratch paper cheap careful realize that this emphasis presentation has nothing with whether English your native language whether you prefer write your solutions with pencil pen quill word processor well written solution starts stating assumptions and then works towards clearly defined goal emphasizing the overall direction and omitting the superfluous Late PolicyIn general you will have least one week work homework assignment and three opportunities attend office hours before that assignment due Assignments turned during one the two class periods following the due date will graded their face value Assignments turned later than that will receive credit but still grade them for feedback purposes Collaboration and Plagiarism col lab rate lab lab lab collaboratus collaborare labor together com laborare labor

solutions the more resourceful you are discovering solutions the more time you will have write them well Indeed you are stuck problem will happy talk with you about during office hours However the solutions you turn must your original writing Copying prepared solution not collaboration all plagiarism pla gia rize pla also steal and pass off one own the ideas words another present one own idea

not copy another person work and present your own The above definitions were copied from the Webster server AttendanceAttendance not official part the course grade but your responsibility stay informed Some announcements will made only class And obviously easier learn things from teacher than directly from the book Unless you hate the teacher Mailing ListOther announcements will made only
