Homework AssignmentsHomework Image Enhancement Histogram Modification Optional Make copy your portrait image public images and then use contrast enhance your face this first rotating the image then cropping window around your head say down your shoulders and finally interactively adjusting the Intensity modification function the Color Editor window under the Windows button You are also free modify other things such color you wish When you have found good grayscale transformation save the result color gif image and put the same directory where the original image Send email telling qualitatively what intensity transformation you applied and why improves the quality the image overall then use this image the photo board students the class Feel free use this image your own Web home page well Homework Skeletons Due October Learn about getting started with the Vista vision softwareRead the Introduction Vista Programming manual that available DOIT Documentation Corrections the Original Assignment Method change condition least instead least this will prevent some types shapes from disappearing altogether Method condition should also count transition the case where and Method the matrix for city block distance should have infinity some large constant not the four corners Method the matrix for chessboard distance should have not the center position TEST IMAGES used vision images DOIT vision images hand vTo evaluate your thinning results you might want try the following additional experiment using the output least one your tests Convert your skeleton image ubyte format using vconvert edit you may need use Emacs because not bit clean the header the new image file that contains the following lines right after the repn ubyte line component interp gradient low threshold high threshold run vlink this file and then vsegedges Try using the results the image hand for example see how well this approach might used determine the direction the index finger pointing for HCI application say Note The thinning method may fact delete entirely some shapes block surrounded all will disappear The thinning algorithm based the papers Zhang and Suen fast parallel algorithm for thinning digital patterns Comm ACM and and Wang comment fast parallel algorithm for thinning digital patterns Comm ACM Comparison student results the different methods applied the pointing hand image and rotated version this test image Homework Image Splining for Mosaics Due October Read the papers Adelson Pyramid methods image processing RCA Engineer Nov Dec Burt and Adelson The Laplacian pyramid compact image code IEEE Trans Comm Burt and Adelson multiresolution spline with application image mosaics ACM Trans Graphics Hints and FAQsSome splined images produced students the class Homework Segmentation Snakes Due November Read the papers Kass Witkin and Terzopoulos Snakes Active contour models Int Computer Vision Williams and Shah fast algorithm for active contours and curvature estimation Computer Vision Graphics and Image Processing Image Understanding Hints and FAQsHomework Your Own Project Due December Student Project Titles and Abstracts See Supplementary Readings for some additional papers that might help you select topic Student projects done Stanford vision course Computer AccountsAccounts Course accounts are the Sun Sparcstations called sun sun rooms and Each account has large disk space quota you can store images for homeworks and your project sure delete old images and compress others see gzip however order save space Email Email sent list goes everyone the class including the instructor and Printers print images you should use one the laserprinters laser laser which are located room Alternatively the generic printer name laser will send output one the four printers with the shortest queue Caution Before sending images the printer sure check the queue there are lot jobs being printed bad manners send images printed because they take long print considerate Vision Software Vista The Vista programming environment will used the homework assignments The code located the directory vision tools vista Man pages are vision tools vista man and executables are vision tools vista bin Xvxv interactive image display program for the window system that very useful for displaying images variety formats ImgStar basic image processing operations invoked using Unix like command lines Code executables and manual are vision tools imgstar Khoros The Khoros image processing software development environment provides set basic image processing modules and graphical programming language interface for rapid prototyping simple image processing algorithms The code located the directory vision tools khoros vision tools khoros bin cantata the executable that starts the interactive environment Netpbm toolkit for conversion images between large variety different formats Based the Pbmplus package Man pages are vision tools man and executables are vision tools bin MatlabMatlab numeric computation and visualization environment Signal processing and image processing toolboxes are especially relevant Test Images Most test images will put the directory vision images although they may require format conversion used Some other images may put public images Numerous image databases are also accessible via the WWW for example see the collection test images CMU ExaminationExaminationSolution The Exam will held Thursday November from the regular classroom Note the early starting time The exam will cover topics through shape from shading including readings the textbook papers sold through DOIT and homework assignments You may bring into the exam one sheet paper with any notes you want both sides The exam will focus main ideas and algorithms not proofs See old exams below for the types questions that will asked Old Exams Exam Spring Exam Spring Exam Spring Exam Spring Links InterestComputer Vision Home Page highly recommended
