University Fall This page under construction Practice problems and solutions are now available Clarifications for Program are available The Program Solution now available Course Description Grading Policies Exam Schedule Lectures Sections Handouts Announcements Programming Assignments Instructors TAs Academic Integrity please read and remember wellCS Course Description Computer Science Introduction Computer Programming Offered Fall credits Prerequisites knowledge continuous mathematics trigonometry and calculus Math equivalent introduction elementary computer programming concepts Emphasis techniques problem analysis and the development algorithms and programs The subject the course programming not particular programming language The principal programming language The course does not presume previous programming experience Programming assignments are tested and run interactive stand alone microcomputers Alternative version COM emphasizing examples and applications involving continuous mathematics including trigonometry and calculus Computer Science basically teaches the same material There are some differences though besides the last letter assumes the knowledge and familiarity with continuous math opposed discrete one including trigonometry and calculus One might wonder what that means programming course Well computer science and math interact many ways and introduces one them scientific computing This does not mean that easier than means that you think you are comfortable with integrals derivatives etc will show you ways applying your knowledge computer programming The point not necessarily test that knowledge but rather expand and apply would like encourage people who think they would qualify take this course Continuous math might not sound that attractive but you can only benefit with this choice often hard find good examples real world problems intro course for but finds one you are not sure whether you qualify please talk the instructor Prof Zabih and ask him for opinion Besides that there slight difference the topics taught and although for the most part they coincide one with another you already know bit about will spend some more time pointers and the model the language itself you don know what this means doesn matter just disregard the last sentence Grading Policies Grades for will computed follows course gradesPrograms Prelim Prelim Prelim Final Graded assignments and exams will returned sections You can pick the unclaimed assignments exams from consultant Carpenter provided you have with you Regrades you feel exam program has been incorrectly graded fill out regrade request giving your reasons writing attach the exam and give the consultant the Carpenter lab regrade request can cause your grade down the paper will regraded from scratch regrade must submited within one week after the graded work has been returned Posted Grades Grades will posted outside the Carpenter lab either srudent four digit code that you give your responibility verify that our records are correct you find error please contact the course administrator Laurie Buck but please only during her office hours Note since error our records can occur you should probably keep your graded assignments exams until you double checked your grade with the posted one Exam Schedule Exam timesExamDateTimeLocation Prelim Mon September TBA Prelim Tue October TBA Prelim Tue November Kimball Upson Final Tue December TBA Note will cover different material than Therefore the corresponding exams will held different rooms Lectures Sections Lectures Time Tuesday Thursday You can either lecture but for the sake consistancy try stick only one Location First five lectures will held together with Olin Starting September Kimball Sections Sections begin Monday September This their schedule Sections DayTimeRoom Mon Olin Mon Olin Mon Olin Tue Hollister Tue Upson Tue Uris Sections are required part the course used clarify topics covered lecture discuss programming problems and work additional problems and excercises Graded programs and exams are returned sections Sample solutions and practice exams are handed out there All sections for each week will cover the same topics Therefore you miss one you can substitute with another one later that week However you will registered for only one section and that will the only one where you can pick your graded work Also excersises might differ different sections depending the instructor and the interests the students Handouts Announcements Obtaining the copies you miss class for some other reason not get handout there are always copies them the Carpenter lab they run out please tell one the consultants there and will print more them out COURSE NOTES Lecture Sorry about the special characters the handout that look funky the web working improving lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture

and should not modify test all Program was due November The solution available Program five Program was passed out class November Clarifications are available Instructors TAs There are two instructor

long don have class but make sure that you email first Thanks Nikola Valerjev Maintains the web site Web Czar Office Upson mail nikola cornell eduOffice Hours Walk basis you have any questions grading syllabus course material completely lost just come and try put you back track You can also ask consultants Carpenter tutor you during more quiet hours you have any complaints about the course assignments are too hard you just cannot grasp what the world the instructor talking about etc please tell This will not affect your grade any negative manner Academic Integrity You may work with one other person the programming assignments Below group refers either individual pair two students working together program The work you submit must the result your group effort only The use computer way modifies the standard academic integrity expected under the Cornell University code conduct You may discuss work with students not your group you may discuss general strategies However cooperation should NEVER involve one student possessing copy all part program written student outside the group regardless whether that copy paper disk addition any output submitted with your program must have been produced your program running described the assignment The penalty for violating the code can include failure University disciplinary action and permanent mark your transcript ASK FIRST you have any questions about whether particular behavior violates our integrity expectations the University Code This page page mantained Wei wei you have any comments suggestions error reports complaints etc about this site please mail weiwei cornell edu and will try satisfy your needs long doesn violate the University policies Last Updated Back the computer science course page Date Wed Nov GMT Server
