Engineering Video Outreach for more information Note Prior the Fall semester Software Engineering was offered joint course combining undergraduate and graduate version the same lecture section under the course number Beginning Fall these courses were split better serve diverse student population Prerequisites Majors Certified for upper division course work computer science Non Majors Experience development moderate sized programs structured high level language Knowledge and Pascal programming helpful and the ability read and understand simple Pascal programs required Examples these languages will used illustrate some fundamental programming ideas Textbook Software Engineering Practitioner Approach Fourth Edition Roger Pressman McGraw Hill Class Meetings The schedule guide the coverage course material preparing for each class please read and study the appropriate material the text There will self evaluation and assessment forms for you complete each reading assignment will also class activities explore solidify concepts Discussion important part this course Outside reading trade and professional publications also encouraged Some articles from professional journals may provided for reading Other information sources There are number excellent publications that provide access contemporary writings Software Engineering number these are listed the section describing the term project addition the Internet has news posting dedicated discussion general software engineering topics comp software eng and there are additional news groups relating special interest areas Homework There will about fifteen homework assignment given this course Normally homework assignments are due the start the next class session you are allowed additional time for particular assignment will indicated the instructions your response the assignment requires more than one page staple the pages together the upper left corner Make sure your name the first page the assignment Exams mid term and final exam will given The exams will given the dates indicated the course schedule COURSE OVERVIEW This course will study some the major problem areas software development and will review analyze and apply many the new techniques being used the development medium large scale software systems Although the emphasis for their development has stemmed from large project environments most the techniques can easily adapted and applied smaller projects well with the similar expectations improved project performance This not programming project course but will extensively study the software development process Major topics covered include Software Engineering Concepts Historical Perspectives Software Life Cycle Paradigms Software Requirements Definition traditional and Software Design Methodologies traditional and Verification and Validation Software Quality Management Considerations Software Development will also cover topics contemporary importance including Software Quality Assurance Total Quality Management Object Oriented Development and Software Process Maturity survey textbook has been selected for use this course but the most date material can only found the recent technical literature Examples include the IEEE Transactions Software Engineering IEEE Transactions Reliability IEEE Computer Communications the ACM ACM SIGSOFT Notices and IEEE Software Most these are available the library Selected articles may assigned for reading and study during the semester supplement the text Some them will discussed course lectures term project approved topic relating software engineering discipline also required preparing the term project you will need personal access reasonable technical library GRADING Final course grades will determined the following basis Collected Homework Mid term Exam Term Project Final Exam Class Participation numerical grading system will employed with the final grade based the weighted sum the points accumulated each the above categories Final grades will determined curve based class performance but case will the curve more severe than standard etc curve CLASS PARTICIPATION All students are expected make regular contribution the class You should prepared offer your comments regarding material presented ask interesting questions during class and respond with good answers questions asked class You may also make contribution via mail significant contribution about every other week considered satisfactory participation level Computer Science Home Page Univ Idaho Home Page billjunk uidaho edu
