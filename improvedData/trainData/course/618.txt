single chip DSP processors will introduced lecture Specifically the arithmetic memory organization pipelining strategies and the use special chip hardware multipliers barrel shifters will emphasized Illustrative examples will given using representative DSP processors such the TMS the TMS the DSP the Motorola DSP the TMS the DSP the Motorola DSP etc Laboratory experiments using both the TMS and the DSP will incluse and conversion sampling real time FIR and IIR digital filter implementations and twelve week real time DSP project the student choice The laboratory will also introduce the students the state the art equipment for DSP design and verification Specifically the Tektronix Analyzer and the DSP Technology SigLabs are versatile multi domain time and frequency instruments capable spectrum network and transient analysis real time DSP systems working the audio frequency range the remainder this page provide introduction the course and the laboratory copy the introductory handout the course and the course syllabus can obtained postscript format clicking here Instructor Professor David Anderson Room EECS Building Phone mail dja umich edu Teaching Assistant Ketan Patel xxx EECS Building Phone xxx mail xxxxx INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Grading Laboratory Lab Reports Exam Final Project Laboratory The structured laboratory segment will count for the total grade based participation and successful completion the weekly exercises Each group will asked some general questions each experiment The intent examine the students understanding the current experiment and they have developed adequate understanding the assembly code Lab Reports report each experiment required each group two students The lab reports will count for the total grade These reports should contain title page with brief summary introduction description the experimental setup results section and discussion and conclusion section The reports need not lengthy and need not typed However try complete and professional your presentation Exams The midterm exam will cover fundamental topics introduced lecture and experiments The Exam will open book notes and lab reports Final Project You will given list suggested project topics the end the second week class The projects emphasize real time DSP applications for example speech music medical etc The project will typically design software hardware algorithm for real time DSP system You are encouraged form teams students for each project with balanced distribution design skills addition the DSP algorithm expertise Smaller teams are also acceptable the scope the project interest demands there are difficulties forming larger teams Each group required submit one page Pre Proposal the end the fourth week class form will provided for filling out the pre proposal Final Project Proposal based the instructors feedback the pre proposal will due the beginning the sixth week class Task Timeline should included the final project proposal one page Progress Report required from each group weekly after the Final Project Report has been approved You will have free access the laboratory while you are working your project However you are expected show during the regular laboratory time demonstrate the current status your project the instructor the This will hopefully allow you keep track your progress towards your final goal Successful completion the project very important However your effort solve unforeseen problems and your engineering approach will rewarded final project report will due the end the semester and technical presentation will scheduled shortly afterwards LABORATORY EXERCISES Lab Introduction the TMS and the AIB Lab Introduction the DSP Lab Finite Impulse Response Filtering Lab Infinite Impulse
