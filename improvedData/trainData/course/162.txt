Music See also the network news group ucsb engr compsci Seminar Readings Multimedia Digital Audio and Computer Music Course Number Time Thursdays Place Engr seminar room Registration Description Multimedia technologies are finding more and more uses computer applications and user interfaces This seminar will survey the technology digital audio signal processing DASP and computer music and discuss several the important topics these fields will discuss the technology digital sound representation synthesis processing and recording well topics related virtual reality multimedia tools electronic games and media data transmission The readings will taken from the leading journals and books the field such Computer Music Journal ACM Computing Surveys IEEE Computer and various books and conference proceedings Participants will also have access range software tools and WWW resources for optional line experimentation The topics will include digital audio signals and their representation analysis synthesis techniques and software sound synthesis sound localization and the synthesis localization cues graphical representation music computers media data storage transfer formats and file systems the MIDI protocol and real time interaction music composition using computers artificial intelligence neural nets genetic algorithms and music object oriented programming and
