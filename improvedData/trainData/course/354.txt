Lindley arrangement Jim Newkirk Associate Instructor jnewkir indiana edu Office hours Wed tentative Lindley arrangement Meetings Lectures Balentine Hall Room Demonstrations Lindley Hall Room during lecture periods announced Discussion Lindley Hall Room regular meetings This time scheduled for reviews examinations and possible discussions Prerequisites and prerequisite corequisite This the honors version and participants must enrolled Honors Division students assumed that you have taken here Indiana and are familiar with the Scheme programming language The particular skills needed are the ability program symbolic programming language and the experience programming with recursion Textbook will use the textbook Logic and Discrete Mathematics Winfried Karl Grassmann and Jean Paul Tremblay Prentice Hall this time the text book order has not arrived the book stores yet Course Description The mathematical foundations computer science differ somewhat from from those the physical and social sciences The study computation has two main branches performance and meaning formalizing performance focus combinatorics and statistics whose foundations are included traditional mathemematics formalizing meaning draw more heavily logic both way express ideas about programs and discipline for describing what computers are and what they Computation takes place discrete digital domain where all phenomena ultimately reduce binary and explore this universe need different mathematical tools than are used physicists and chemists use induction far more often than differentiation integration for example and will see numerous styles inductive reasoning this course will also explore discrete mathematical structures trees and other graphs that are prevalent computing The main goal the course improve each participant ability conduct rigorous mathematical argument that proofs One reason not the only one look logic this course for the purpose evaluating proof narratives central idea this course that doing proof and programming are pretty much the same activities The better you are proving the better programmer you will More important the better computer scientist you will become plan follow the text book except for Chapters Prolog Specification and Relational Database Systems may have skip more chapters depending our progress through the material may also introduce some topics from later chapters along There are few topics not the text that may look again there time any event will cover all the material core course Syllabus and supplementary material One two weeks will devoted each the chapters listed below Supplementary material will included below the chapter listing some cases This evolving syallabus which will grow the course develops Check weekly for new additions the supplementary material Chapter Propositional Logic weeks problem assignments pgm truth table generator Scheme pgm sets set operations Scheme pgm dnf DNF generator Notes from meetings

from meetings February through March Chapter Program Correctness Proofs weeks Notes from meetings partial notes for lectures while programs their meanings and Hoare logic The Hoare Calculus for program proofs summary the inference rules Chapter More Functions week Code the split function tentative Chapter Graphs and Trees week tentative Chapter Grammars Languages and Parsing weeks tentative Selected topics time permitting Homework assignments studying the textbook material you should work enough exercises and problems the text ensure that you understand the material Since many the discussions class will derive from these exercises should certain that least one individual has worked through every one them every problem has assigned one two students who are expected able present the problem class meeting These assignments are maintained the newsgroup Most homeworks will not graded for credit the purpose these assignments guide participants preparing for the presentation material the class and show the kinds problems that will asked examinations Challenges are homework assignments that are offered for credit These will clearly indicated when posted Homework Assignment One Homework Assignment TwoDue Monday February class Homework Assignment ThreeDue Thursday February class Homework Assignment Four Solutions are posted Homework Assignment Five given class April Due Thursday April class Homework Assignment SixDue Thursday April class Solutions are posted this course you are welcome discuss assignments presentations and challenges with other students not assume this true all your courses Teamwork doing assignments good long each member the team contributes and fully understands the assignment you are working with group please indicate your homework papers someone has given you lot help acknowledge them you will not penalized and they will get the thanks they deserve Grading and gradebooks The gradebook will posted this home page and updated regularly Thu Mar EST Wed Apr EST Fri May EST The listing evaluation criteria shown below tentative For this honors class would like place greater emphasis interation and participation than formal examinations and assignments However the form participation something would like discuss the first meeting the class Also since required enter grade for each participant the end the semester some objective performance comparison will necessary for paricipation including classroom presentations class discussion posted challenges and projects for Exam scheduled during the discussion session week and location announced for Exam scheduled during the discussion session week and location announced for the Final Exam Currently scheduled for Tuesday April location announced Communication This home page the primary distribution point for information the course progresses Please check regularly The course newsgroup csci used post announcements such assignments exams and any exceptions our usual office hours You are also encouraged use post questions related the course participate discussions share related information with the class Please make habit looking for new notes few times each week individual matters please feel free contact your instructor associate instructor via email drop their office The scheduled office hours are reserved for students but you are welcome and encouraged drop other times Course Evaluation Participants are strongly encouraged use the department World Wide Web based course evaluation system which can accessed through the Computer Science Department home page Evaluation summaries will extracted two times during the semester During the first three weeks students will asked provide feedback all aspects the course providing early opportunity inform the instructors about how the course should run Final course evaluations are taken seriously the department and are integral yearly faculty and department evaluations encourage participation credit will given those students who submit full evaluation during the week prior final examinations The evaluations are anonymous but transaction record generated whenever individual evaluation updated These transaction records are compiled and sorted the Undergraduate Secretary Thus the instructor informed about who filed evaluations independently what those evaluations may contain Final evaluation content will not reviewed the instructor until after grades are assigned Policies Attendence Not all the material presented this course the text book Class attendance not monitored and not mandatory although regular attendance and class participation are factor grading Attendance examinations mandatory and make examinations will normally not given special assignments projects will given help students raise their grades Academic Integrity you have not already done please read the Computer Science Department Statement Academic Integrity sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate Cases academic dishonesty will reported the Office Student Ethics branch the Office the Dean Students Withdrawal Wednesday March the last day drop course withdraw from all courses with automatic After that date student may withdraw only with the permission his her dean This approval normally only for urgent reasons related extended illness equivalent distress Incompletes incomplete final grade will given only exceptional circumstances conforming university and departmental policies which requires among other things that the student must have completed the bulk the work required for the course with passing grade and that the remaining work can made within days after the end the semester these conditions cannot met withdrawal the appropriate course
