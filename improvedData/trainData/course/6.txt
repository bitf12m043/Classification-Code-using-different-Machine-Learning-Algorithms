class Modern Operating Systems and Object Oriented Programming Using are available the book store Lectures and Discussion SectionsLecture times Tuesday Thursday Computer Sciences Discussion section Wednesday Noland Note that there the extra Wednesday discussion section This section will used mainly recitation section discuss material covered lecture and for the weekly quizzes occasion will used discuss important details the programming assignments and homeworks Make sure that you leave room your schedule attend this section Exams Quizzes There will midterms The final optional Each week starting the second week classes there will quiz the Discussion Section The quizzes will last minutes Following are the past quizzes with answers Processes and concurrency February Semaphores February Monitors February Messages February Scheduling Synchronization March Segmentation Paging March TLB April Demand Paging April File Systems April File Systems and Recovery May Programming Assignments There will about four programming assignments during the semester Details these assignments will given class handouts These assignments will written and done workstations running UNIX unlikely that you will able all these assignments your personal computer Programming assignment available The goal this assignment practice using learn some UNIX system facilities and try write really input tolerant program Programming assignment available The goal this assignment write program that uses multiple processes and synchronization Programming assignment available You are write simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms you will use traces activities real UNIX systems drive your simulation The goals this assignment are learn more about the CPU scheduling algorithms learn about trace driven simulation and experiment with quantitatively analyzing computer system Written Problem Sets During the semester will hand out several written problem sets based the lectures These problem sets are for your use and not need turned Though you will find that you will poorly the weekely quizzes you don the problems Solution sets for the problem will handed out about two weeks after the problem set The and will happy answer questions these problems and look over your solutions Problem Set available The goal this assignment learn about using the various synchronization primitives solve problems Problem Set available The goal this assignment learn memory management hardware and software Late Work Assignments are due the date listed the handout Over the entire semester you have three late days credit You can use these late days different assignments one day each three assignments all three days one assignment Other than these three days absolutely late work will accepted Late days cannot used any assignment that due during the last week classes Cheating Programming assignments will done with partners Each group two will work independently from other groups Cheaters will receive the maximum penalties which include receiving grade for the course and having this marked your transcript Computer Facilities will probably using the Solaris UNIX workstations for this course These are UNIX workstations running the Sun Solaris operating systems and windows All students who have registered for this class should have account Grading PolicyIf you don take the final you take the final Programming assignments Programming assignments Quizzes Quizzes Final Final Your lowest quiz grade will dropped from the average there will quiz during the first week nor during the week after Spring
