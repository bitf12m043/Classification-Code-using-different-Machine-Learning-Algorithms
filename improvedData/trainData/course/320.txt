you would like help but these hours not work for you please let know Room Beckman where the terminals connected our machine muddcs are find leave the back the lecture hall Galileo Edwards turn right then another right down the long corridor Proceed the new section the building then turn right the second door the right get office back the long corridor and keep going the end right then upstairs you will then the Olin building then left then left again the southeast corner Olin office which inside always open during business hours door usually closed filter out noise but don hesitate knock Catalog Description Introduction principles computer science Algorithms complexity analysis data structuring data and procedural abstraction grammars correctness logic principles processor organization operating system concepts programming languages basic automata theory and theoretical limitations Course Goals learn and apply basic principles computer science including software construction hardware organization and limitations computers Text Robert Keller Principles Computing January Available one time special order for cost reproduction and strongly recommended that you buy copy The entire book also line Microsoft word KATO the Mac server the folder KATO HOME Department Homes will thus viewable from Macs the local network will see about getting version well However still recommended that you purchase the book rather than say getting someone old version because The book has been revised substantially since the last course offering The book large pages and reading all the screen apt tiresome and inconvenient The book can taken into the exams whereas Mac cannot Course Assumptions Students should have had first course computing the college level Prior experience preferred although not essential Others have made through starting with just knowledge Pascal You should know about procedures arrays and types minimum you are unfamiliar with these please take first Lectures The word lecture below used very loosely expect that the lecture periods will include some explanation but will more like multilogue set dialogues You are expected attend ask questions and provide comments Threads There are essentially three interwoven threads the course The book the problems and the lectures try keep them synch with one another but active participation all three threads required Volume wise the book covers more material than can discussed the lecture The lecture will cover some things not the book Staying attune what going lecture will help you focus the areas the book that are important far exam emphasis The problems exercise some but not all the things discussed the book and lecture Resources The course planned interactive throughout are eager prevent programming difficulties from consuming extraordinary time please ask when you get stuck with such difficulties much more efficient start early each assignment that you give yourself enough time cope with the numerous contingencies which inevitably materialize You can get help line emailing help muddcs which goes the graders tutors and don enable talk because too slow but check email often When you email message will typically answered the entire class with parts your message embedded you not want attributed you please indicate your message carrying problem solutions through computer implementation you are showing that you understand the issues principles and techniques will explain you how work any problem any level detail you ask However you must with sufficient time margin Telling the eleventh hour that you just aren getting and therefore want drop the course not availing yourself the substantial help available You are also welcome submit email note card with any question you like have answered any point you would like addressed before after class leave mailbox Olin course you are encouraged ask such questions class well There are many tools available the computer itself Use the man feature UNIX find what you need and explore The command man command gives information specific command The command man topic lists commands relating specific topic You can also use the info reader GNU Emacs for certain library language and editor specifics emacs type escape info Helpful information examples line copies assignments etc will kept various subdirectories the directory machine muddcs There web page for rex documentation Finally the corner store maxim applies you can find what you want ask for Grading There will approximately eight assignments entailing programming Programming assignments help drive home key working concepts and principles After the first couple assignments where the rex language one you have not likely seen used the language used will mostly used due its position emergent industry standard and its ability reflect both low level computer structure and the same time provide high level data and object abstractions There will may one assignment assembly language programming using simulated computer the ISC prior exposure varies across the class will hold one more special evening sessions for you request this Programming Course Although much the course entails programming consider exposure computer science ideas the important part The intent the programming assignments drive home these key ideas willing devote much each class period needed nominally minutes more detailed examples programming techniques and for specific programming questions and answers this does not appear useful given day the time will used for other purposes Honor Code StandardRead this carefully Although discussion problems with others encouraged programming emphasizes individual learning rather than group projects observe the following Standard You may discuss the assignment with other students You may not share give receive written work any kind inside outside the course Elaboration the case programming assignments consider email computer files fragments files and printed output written work developing code for programming assignment you can discuss ideas with others but discussion ideas must not involve wholesale examination transcription the actual working code others with the exception that you may use any code explicitly provided the instructor Definitely forbidden form collaboration wherein two more students split assignment then transcribe each others contributions sometimes changing names variables comments formatting etc this occurs failing grade issued automatically the help you get from another significant you should acknowledge your submission You not lose credit for this you have any doubts about whether form interaction constitutes violation this standard please consult with prior continuing Grading Weights The programming assignments will constitute the grade The mid term examination will count and the final Class attendance participation random quizzes etc will account for the remaining Various practice problems will indicated particular you should able work most two dot problem the notes relating material covered lecture These not need submitted but the exams will consist largely problems similar level along with some perhaps little easier harder Exams are open book and emphasize conceptual understanding rather than memorization fine details Late Assignment Policy Submissions are done emailing source code the grader grad muddcs which also establishes the time submission The due dates assignments should noted carefully The work assignment should conducted the week weeks before not the last day when there space for the necessary thinking There automatic fixed one day grace period all assignments other words the due date states day then the assignment must turned before midnight day receive any credit After midnight day work you spend the problem for you own edification only which not say that isn worth doing required you just don get points for then best plan get the assignments the stated due date Topic Outline The lectures will roughly follow this outline The progression the rate about two the numbered topics below per week should say that this what would like Depending background some the topics expand longer than allocated with the result that other topics get jettisoned fall off the end Please keep the reading without being explicitly assigned The notes generally expand the lectures and discussions But the lectures may also expand the notes introduce new material More often than not several threads will interwoven the lectures over period time part emphasize the commonality concepts from different vantage points Brackets below indicate where chapters the notes start with respect the concepts that follow The outline does not mention every topic The actual lectures determine points emphasis Computing the Rules Computation problems and models computation States and transitions List notation Functional specifications Computation rewriting
