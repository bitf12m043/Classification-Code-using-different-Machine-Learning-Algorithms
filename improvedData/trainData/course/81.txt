which covers the basic programming structures needed prepare students for and elementary engineering courses prior computer programming experience required and only basic knowledge computers assumed The material covered will enable you write simple computer programs solve engineering problems elementary courses All programming done FORTRAN This course intended for students who received little programming instruction high school This section taught entirely the FORTRAN programming language and intended primarily for engineering students and non computer science majors Click here for course

based four programming assignments each worth not including Program This course Credit Credit only There are tests exams Assignments each for Syllabus tentative The following topics and sections the text will approximately covered each week during the semester You will only get the most out this class you read the relevant sections the text before coming class This way you will able ask questions class about anything that you are unsure instead waiting until you the lab trying work assignment discover you didn really understand something Weeks Text and Lecture NotesText Fortran with Engineering Applications edition Koffman and Friedman Lecture Notes Copies the lecture notes will available line the end each week class Important the line lecture notes are not substitute for coming class They not include any examples additional notes that put the board except for Week You are responsible for all the material covered class Week Week Programming Assignments There are four programming assignments each contributing your final grade You must attempt complete every programming assignment you hand program that does not run will not even compile without errors then will get very low mark check the gradesheets and you risk failing the course GradesheetsWhat DOS Fortran and how hand assignments online Late PolicyPolicy Academic Misconduct cheating Assignment Specifications Program due Friday Program due Wednesday How Get Help with Your Assignments Consultants The consultants the computer lab can help you with most problems They wear name tags and are duty from approximately Consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax well how login use the printers send mail run Netscape etc Click here for more information about the consultants Instructor General questions about assignment questions that may require long explanation are best answered myself Please see during office hours send mail not normally office except during office hours because research from home via modem Therefore you want see outside office hours please make appointment first You can most easily contact mail because regularly login and read mail from home you mail from Netscape make sure include your name and mail address they don show for won know who mailed and able respond otherwise Click here send mail Problem Solving Exercises One the most important skills you will learn this class problem solving Good problem solving skills distinguish good computer programmer from bad one doesn matter how familiar skilled you are particular programming language you not understand how solve the problem then you will not able write computer program for any language help you learn problem solving skills and techniques will assign weekly problem solving exercises These will small but non trivial problems which will give out each Monday You should look the problem and think about during the week and right down the steps you would through solve the problem the overall structure your program This primarily exercise general problem solving you not have write any FORTRAN code though you may you want and have time and your solution algorithm should not even dependent particular programming language such FORTRAN will over the solution class the following Monday Exercises Computer Lab You will using the Vectra lab Computer Science Statistics containing Hewlett Packard Vectra running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft FORTRAN This lab open from seven days week except certain holidays The printer room located across the hall You have quota pages which print Once you exceed that quota you must contact the lab either mail going room during office hours they prefer mail pay increase your quota Beware Some the machines the Vectra lab aren configured correctly particular the machines along the wall closest the outside hallway towards the left hand part the room Try avoid those you can You may also use your home dorm computers write your programs however you will probably have purchase your own copy Microsoft FORTRAN Lahey Personal FORTRAN see the inside cover the textbook You may also work any the other computer labs campus however most not have FORTRAN compilers please see first before using the CAE lab The software you will using the lab includes Microsoft Windows and DOSE mailNetscape Other Pointers Interest
