Things are subject change BECAUSE THINGS MAY CHANGE you should hit the RELOAD BUTTON your browser when you come this page make sure you seeing the most recent version Online Course Readings and Reference Material Syllabus Lecture Notes Declarative Programming Course Notes Scheme and its Implementation html for web browsing These notes are under construction Only the first few sections are reasonably well indexed for browsing and the later sections will change the course goes along Reading far ahead the class likely adventure suggest that you use this web page with browser while using Scheme system interactively Especially while working through chapter the tutorial This will allow you cut text out the document and paste into running Scheme system THERE ARE ERRORS THIS TEXT especially the later chapters That another reason read the html version with browser rather than printing out hardcopy correct most the errors before get those chapters The Scheme language definition html format for online browsing This lists all the standard features Scheme and tersely describes what they For most stuff this course Scheme course notes will more helpful but you want know about miscellanous functions and exactly what they this the authority First set Practice Questions There also version with answers Second set Practice Questions There also version with answers Quiz with answers Third set Practice Questions There also version with answers Notes naming conventions and indenting for Scheme which you should consult when doing homework that can read your code and grade sensibly and notes drawing data structures Homework assignment writing merge sort Scheme and solutions the first three problems Commented Scheme code Notes simple reader including regular expressions BNF grammar and the actual code Scheme Scheme code for simple backward chaining propositional calculus theorem prover which essentially little subset Prolog and set rules for classifying animals logic program about kinds animals play with using the theorem prover picture some class objects and instances illustrate the simple object system from the Scheme notes and another picture showing class objects and the metaclass object illustrating the circularity that makes the latter self describing Scheme code for simple object based programming system based classes and generic procedures inheritance not implemented yet Notes type systems including inheritance and subtyping Take Home Quiz and the answers and some explanations Test and version Test with Answers and some explanations The main language using this course Scheme and default the implementation use RScheme which installed the public SPARCs running Solaris and running AIX the machine you run RScheme with the command bin runscheme you use your own machine and you running Linux Solaris any several other implementations UNIX you can get RScheme and install your machine free You can find from Donovan Kolbly Home Page sure get version later and ask the Zhu Qing for patch make friendlier for newbies you using your own machine and Mac recommend getting Gambit Marc Feeley implementation Scheme free too You can get from the Scheme Repository see below you using running Windows DOS not sure what the best Scheme get There are bunch available the Scheme Repository not use MIT Scheme Guile they not standard Scheme You might try Gambit Mark Feeley MzScheme from Rice you use something besides RScheme recommend getting the Meroon version object system from the Scheme Repository when start doing object oriented programming For few assignments you may have use RScheme under UNIX take advantage RScheme object system but for most things you should able use Meroon The Scheme Repository The Scheme Repository the University Indiana has lots free implementations Scheme and various documents Scheme you get interested learning more about Scheme than cover this class that the place look comp lang scheme There
