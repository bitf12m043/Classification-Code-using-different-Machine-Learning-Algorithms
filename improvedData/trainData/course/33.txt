systems The impact network and distributed computing environments operating systems also discussed This fast paced subject requiring constant attention Prerequsites Complete familiarity with the material assumed particular knowledge computer architecture assembly programming language and program structure required cover some the introductory material class required but the purpose that will remind the audience the material Course Outline The course will organized roughly follows say roughly because depending the feedback from the class may change the order the content particular sections start off with overview concurrency issues discuss synchronization issues particular ensuring mutual exclusion deadlock detections and prevention algorithms discuss multiprocessor issues well Next memory management Here discuss virtual memory and various methods used implement virtual memory such paging and segmentation Next cover file systems Finally look evolution the traditional operating systems and look micro kernels time permits have few lectures advanced topics such multi threading and serverless file systems Textbooks The principal text book for the class the Operating System Concepts book Abraham Silberschatz and Peter Galvin also distribute class notes which will cover the material completely The class notes will also available the world wide web from the class home page the end each class Course Schedule will meet Monday thru Thursday from during the weeks There will two class quizzes The first will and the second will The final will addition there will weekly

understanding the current state the art web operating systems and also address problems that must solved provide mature general purpose web operating system key hypothesis behind the design this class that many the issues now being addressed the context the web also have been addressed other more traditional areas operating systems will occasionally read non web related papers that may have some
