far The questions posed are quotes Problem the last sentence takes more time sigma than sigma What does the word time refer Amortized time Total time others ANSWER Total time Problem well known faces Any data structure for disjoint sets requires Big Omega time the worst case but our text book Big not Big Omega there any difference ANSWER meant Big Omega see the first sentence the second paragraph the Chapter notes Problem the last sentence two vertices the cycle contain distinct labels from the same two vertices the cycle can contain same labels right ANSWER Right think the problem the final exam little unclear Does denote the size the largest true submatrix the size the largest true submatrix where does not have equal ANSWER submatrix true only for some and all its entries are true

ObjectivesCS has two objectives Present the concepts data structures general and some the most widely used structures detail Data structures are the fundamental building blocks computer programs the end the course you should able identify situations which data structure necessary determine the requirements for the data structure and select the appropriate data structure from those covered this course Reiterate the concepts structure programming abstract data types and modularity These principles which were introduced are essential writing clear correct and maintainable software there close connection between abstract data types and data structures this course places strong emphasis applying these principles all programming exercises Teaching AssistantsWei Zhang and Chin Tang Chin are the teaching assistants TAs for this course sections and They will grade your homework assignments and will happy answer questions about the assignments any other aspect the course that giving you

This well written little long winded text that covers most but not all the material this course also includes background about separate text for the language not necessary The lectures will often but not always follow David Dewitt Lecture Notes Fall These notes are far more complete that simple lecture notes but they fall short true text book they contain very little narrative text exercises etc using these notes basis for lectures such feel free skip portions and cover additional material You may want purchase these notes which are available from the DoIT documentation desk the Dayton Street entrance the Computer Sciences building Dayton this course your first experience with Unix you will need information about activating your account logging creating editing and manipulating files and compiling running and debugging programs The handout also available from the DoIT information desk contains this crucial information Also see also the help section below Lecture Information Tuesday and Thursday Psychology mentioned above lectures will often follow DeWitt notes Lecture attendence strongly recommended will regularly present material that does not appear the textbook lecture notes but will useful for the programming assignments and exams Needless say You are responsible for all material covered lecture The exams will based the lecture material reading assignments the notes and the course assignments Electronic MailI often use electronic mail notify students changes assignments hints for programs etc assume that you regularly read your electronic mail GradingThere will one two evening exams during the semester final exam and five programming assignments The exams will determine the final grade with approximately equal weight for each one and the programming assignments will count for each The Language will taught using the programming language and programming assignments must written you not know you should not this section Jim Skrentny teaching two sections that cover addition data structures large and complex language unless you are experience programming and even then difficult language learn from book There also another WWW page with more information the programming assignments GdbThere also web page that describes the gdb program debugger Exams Exam Tuesday Oct Chemistry Exam TBA Final Exam Wednesday December place TBA Course Schedule The following
