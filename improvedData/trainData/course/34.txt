The answers the midterm exam and summary the scores are now available more detailed breakdown the grade distribution also available Oct The specification for Project now avaiable Oct The due date for Project has been moved Thursday Oct few typographical errors the notes Deadlock Avoidance have been corrected Most importantly the same array was being called some places and others now called all places popular demand old midterm exam available for you look Warning You should take this example with large grain salt The exam from very long time ago when the course used different text and covered topics different order This semester midterm will likely quite different Oct The time and place for the Midterm exam have been determined will room Comp Sci from October Oct The specification for Project now avaiable Oct discussion the issues presented class day available Oct summary the grades for project are available Oct The electronic hand directions for program have now been posted Oct The procedure giveFork Algorithm the Project specification should contain call notify The web page has been corrected show this Sept fixed two more bugs the Project specification one minor and one that more important The first caused the Introduction paragraph slightly garbled Thanks Jake Dawley Carr for pointing this one out The second was line omitted from the sample code for Algorithm the Programming Details section After you create ThreadScheduler you have start ThreadScheduler sched new ThreadScheduler sched start This was specified correctly the later section the ThreadScheduler but not the Details section The Web page now fixed Thanks Liping Zhang for this one Sept Test data files for Project are now available The directory public src contains three data files and Java class for reading them The file public src Graph java contains the definition the class Graph described the project specification The file public src petersonCyclic graph contains the Peterson graph shown the project specification mentioned there this initial placement forks not acyclic The file public src petersonAcyclic graph contains the Peterson graph with acyclic initial placement forks The file public src star graph contains star topology with one central philosopher sharing forks with each nine others Sept Todd Jenner pointed out two typos the specification for Project The forks are the numbers through should read The forks are the numbers through and eat MAXTHINK should replaced MAXEAT The online version has been corrected Thanks Todd Sept There was mistake the Java tutorial notes the section Strings the two argument version String substring the second argument the offset the end the substring not the number characters the string The notes have been corrected Thanks Franco Tung Fai Chan for pointing this out Sept occasionally send urgent messages directly mailing list students registered for this course There archive all messages sent this list the web you are not receiving these messages and think you should send mail solomon wisc edu The specification for Project now avaiable have received few requests for makefiles for Java There sample Makefile public src Makefile Copy that file the working directory where your Java source files are remember you should use separate directory for each project edit described the comments and then type make compile and run your program make classes compile without running Sept Notes handing your assignment and simulating preemptive multitasking for the Solaris computers have been added here Sept The Java tutorial now finished about finished going get the section threads you will find some helpful hints how structure project You should aware that there weekly seminar operating systems and networking meeting Mondays The first seminar the semester Monday the Check the Colloquia and Seminars web page for more details Sept The Java Book finally available the University Bookstore Sept The beginnings Java tutorial are now available Sept use Java Department Unix workstations you must create file named cshrc local your home directory containing one line set path path java bin make the change take effect either type source cshrc local simply log out and log back Sept The specification for project ready Sept The Unix Orientation Sessions for all new Unix users are scheduled for the following times Tues Thurs Sept and room Mon Thurs Sept room Last updated Wed Sep CDT Contents News Summary Lecture Information Text Projects Grading Course Schedule Lecture Notes Summary intended general introduction the techniques used implement operating systems and related kinds systems software Among the topics covered will process management creation synchronization and communication processor scheduling deadlock prevention avoidance and recovery main memory management virtual memory management swapping paging segmentation and page replacement algorithms control disks and other input output devices file system structure and implementation and protection and security Lecture Information Lecture Tuesday and Thursday Computer Sciences and Statistics Discussion Wednesday Psychology The discussion section not optional least important the lectures The primary focus the Wednesday meetings will topics related the projects including introduction the Java programming language but time will also available for answering any questions you have regarding points raised the the lectures the text Text Required Modern Operating Systems Andrew Tanenbaum Prentice Hall Strongly Recommended The Java Programming Language Ken Arnold and James Gosling Addison Wesley Online References Lots additional helpful materials about Java are available the WEB The following references have been collected locally for fast access The Java TutorialThe Java Language SpecificationJava API Documentation Watch this spot for additional links the web Projects There will five programming projects all the Java programming language Sun SparcStation workstations running the Solaris dialect the Unix operating system are provided for your use but you may use any computer which you have access that implements the Java programming language However you not use the Computer Sciences Department computers you will responsible for transferring any required data sets software packages your computer The first assignment will easy get acquainted exercise designed help you become familiar with the computing environment and the Java language Subsequent projects will involve process synchronization processor scheduling disk scheduling and file system implementation all but the first project students will required work pairs Both members pair will receive the same grade project Feel free discuss projects with anyone but you must not share code with anyone but your partner Cheating will vigorously punished Enough said Assignments are due the beginning class the date indicated Over the entire semester you have three late days credit You can use these late days different assignments one day each three assignments all three days one assignment Late days may not used for the last assignment Why Java Most students taking this course will familiar with but not Java Why then did choose Java There are several arguments favor Java more congenial programming environment Runtime errors such bad subscripts null pointers and uninitialized variables cause exceptions caught the language runtime rather than mysterious crashes random behavior Java Strings are much easier use than char arrays Garbage collected storage management extremely handy And more Java very trendy Java had caught faster than any other new language history Many the reasons for Java growing popularity have little with the way will use this course will discuss these issues class but byproduct this course will knowledge Java which becoming quite marketable commodity Java has operating system features built particular the first widely used programming language with language level support for concurrency threads and synchronization monitors the other hand switching new programming language always bit dislocating Fortunately there are excellent resources are available ease the transition The Java Programming Language Arnold and Gosling amazingly good neither introductory programming primer the authors assume you already know how program nor reference manual although reference manual available online but readable introduction the language which takes you all the way from getting started everything you need write quite sophisticated programs Java This book available the University Bookstore You are strongly encouraged buy have also gathered variety other resources together including nice online tutorial about Java programming and reference manual for the standard class libraries you will using Grading There will midterm and final exam each which will count for your grade The midterm will the evening Wednesday October from room Computer Sciences and Statistics The final scheduled the timetable will Tuesday December The first programming project getting started will count for your grade The remaining four projects will count for each Course Schedule The following schedule tentative may updated later the semester check back here frequently Sept Introduction Chapter Sept Oct Processes Synchronization
