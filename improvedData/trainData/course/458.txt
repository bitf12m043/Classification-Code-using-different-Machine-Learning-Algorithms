purchase rental The contents that course are very similar that described here Contact Engineering Video Outreach for more information Course Description This course will view software engineering activities from management perspective centering around study the software development process will view the process terms its constituent tasks focusing the flow information and interconnection between tasks will highlight interdependencies created work products Our approach contrast the traditional software engineering course such the prerequisite for this course which focuses the techniques employed accomplish technical activities Topics covered include software development paradigms life cycles such waterfall evolutionary incremental and spiral software process maturity Capability Maturity Model and BOOTSTRAP Model software process assessment and improvement change management concepts process and product metrics organization and management strategies and risk assessment Although will study several management topics this not course software project management will not cover how manage people and resources Project management will discussed only constituent tasks the overall context producing software product Participation class activities some individual activities term project and final exam will required Some additional effort will required for graduate credit Prerequisites Software Engineering instructor permission For NTU students something equivalent substantial work experience will considered equivalent Knowledge modern software engineering techniques will assumed Computer Access None required but access and use Internet for course material and electronic mail expected Goals The goal this course provide systematic study the software development process with emphasis how define and manage This course will expose participants several possible approaches software development identify the tasks that are essential for successful projects discuss how tasks interact with each other and discuss how organization can develop and mature its software development process The course will not advocate particular development approach but rather will take critical look the most popular and most talked about strategies After successfully completing this course participants will familiar with terminology used this topical area have read and analyzed important historical and current literature addressing software life cycle models and software process issues understand the basic concepts embodied the most prevalent software life cycle models including knowledge their advantages and disadvantages and when may appropriate use each life cycle approach able construct and represent software life cycle for organization project able construct project software life cycle that consistent with specific software life cycle model understand the factors that are important building the capability maturity software development organization able assess the maturity level software development organization understand factors that contribute successful process change implementation able plan and implement software process improvement activity Texts Mark Paulk The Capability Maturity Model Guidelines for Improving the Software Process Addison Wesley Journal articles historical current importance and other material may provided the instructor Alternate Resources you are interested additional information this subject the following list presents some resources that you may find useful For this course you are not required have access these resources and student without access them will not disadvantage this course Managing the Software Process Watts Humphrey Addison Wesley Capability Maturity Model for Software Version Mark Paulk CMU SEI Software Engineering Institute February Key Practices the Capability Maturity Model Version Mark Paulk CMU SEI Software Engineering Institute February Software Process Assessment and Improvement The BOOTSTRAP Approach Kuvaja Blackwell IEEE Std Standard for Developing Software Life Cycle Processes IEEE Grading Participation Outside reading book Process Assessment Assignment Process Definition Assignment Individual Project Final Exam Undergraduate and graduate sections the course are graded separately Due slightly different schedules off campus and campus sections are graded separately Participation All students are expected make regular contribution the class campus students should prepared offer their comments regarding material presented ask interesting questions during class and respond with good answers questions asked class Calling attention high quality article not included the course readings package topic discussed class encouraged Off campus students should communicate with regular basis using telephone fax mail comment material presented class provide feedback industry practitioner perspectives regarding topics studied relate personal experiences relevant class discussions and course ask questions campus students may also make contribution via mail significant contribution about every other week considered the minimum satisfactory participation level portion some class session will devoted discussion and feedback based questions and comments supplied from off campus Assignments You will required perform software process assessment and make report your findings You may evaluate software development organization with which you are familiar you may evaluate case study will make available practical application some the course material you will expected develop process definition representation portion your work function This process definition defines the tasks and interfaces with other people and organizations Outside ReadingStudents enrolled for graduate credit will required read one book that related development life cycles organizational maturity process improvement list acceptable books will provided Term ProjectThe course also requires approved term project which should practical application some concept studied the course The project expected more extensive for graduate students than for undergraduates For the project you might prepare Software Management Plan following IEEE standards develop software process simulation model your organization study software process metrics from your organization You are expected propose topic and receive approval before starting Additional guidelines will provided each these activities All assignment projects etc should sent directly not the Video Outreach Office The address listed above will work for both Mail Federal Express and UPS The final exam must sent your examination coordinator the Video Outreach Office You will probably want keep copy all work that you submit just case something gets lost the mail Unfortunately this does happen Course Outline approximate Software Life Cycle Paradigms sessions
