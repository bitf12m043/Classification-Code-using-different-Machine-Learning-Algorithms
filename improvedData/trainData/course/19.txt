Thu May GMT Content length Geometric Algorithms Geometric Algorithms Spring Gates This course covers the fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing geometric algorithms two three and higher dimensions will give depth coverage basic geometric data structures such convex hulls arrangements Voronoi and Delaunay diagrams flat and hierarchical triangulations partition trees etc will also survey several important paradigms geometric algorithm design including sweep line plane methods randomized techniques cuttings and their applications parametric searching and various geometric optimization methods will motivate the material with example problems drawn from application areas such robotics graphics vision and geography and discuss some the non trivial issues involved implementing geometric algorithms robustly Prerequisite data structures and algorithms Contact informationCourse outlineCourse mechanicsBibliographyGeometric algorithms linksHandouts Handout Course

Thursdays Julien Basch mail jbasch stanford edu Office Gates Room Office hours Wednesdays and Course Outline There now much material computational geometry that probably full year course needed cover all the basic techniques Nevertheless given some algorithmic preparation can cover lots ground even one quarter Below list topics covered but not promise cover them the order listed Geometric fundamentals Computational primitives two and three dimensions and their implementation models computation and lower bounds geometric duality Convexity Algorithms for convex hulls point sets two and three dimensions convex polygons properties and algorithms Arrangements The combinatorics line arrangements including the zone theorem Sweep line methods for arrangements topological sweep Davenport Schinzel sequences Many face problems Proximity problems Voronoi Diagrams and Delaunay triangulations algorithms and applications Geometric searching Point location planar subdivisions Fractional cascading and other efficient data structuring techniques Three dimensional analogs Partition trees and range searching The ham sandwich theorem decimation methods range searching problems various kinds Triangulations Triangulating simple polygon reductions among geometric problems decompositions polyhedra questions optimality Random sampling techniques Random sampling for partitioning randomized incremental algorithms epsilon nets making randomized algorithms deterministic Cuttings and their applications Visibility and shortest path problems Visibility graphs and their uses Euclidean minimum spanning tree and shortest path problems Robustness geometric computation Issues topological consistency handling degeneracies robust algorithms Course mechanics Class hours Tuesday Thursday Gates Text The main text for the course reader comprised number survey articles plus lecture notes scribed with the help students previous years this class second recommended reader preprint the forthcoming book Computational Geometry Example Mark Berg Mark van Kreveld Mark Overmars and Otfried Schwarzkopf This book uses examples from application areas motivate all the main structures and techniques computational geometry and may become the main text for this course future years These two readers are available the Stanford Bookstore Homeworks Exams Grading etc The course will have three substantial and mathematically challenging homeworks the pencil and paper type There will final exam but there will midterm whose function will test breath but not depth For the final grade will count each the homeworks and the midterm the grade Please the homework there other way learn the material Homework midterm schedule Homework Handed out Due Tuesday April Tuesday April Tuesday April
