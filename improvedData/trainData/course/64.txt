ShabelURL http www wisc edu markhill Computer architecture the science and art selecting and interconnecting hardware components create computer that meets functional performance and cost goals This course qualitatively and quantitatively examines computer design tradeoffs will learn for example how uniprocessors execute many instructions concurrently and why state the art memory systems are nearly complex processors Examining tradeoffs requires that you already know how design correct computer taught the important prerequisite ECE also prerequisite but less important and may taken
