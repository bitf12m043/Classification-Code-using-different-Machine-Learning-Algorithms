methodology may found Weiland and Shneiderman February Munish Visualizing track queries February Arijit Sengupta Structured Documents Multimedia Databases Documents have been big source information for almost all the history human civilization However until recently information documents was not being used propoerly because poor structuring documents Introduceion structured documents using tags markups have majorly changed this situation and tagged electronic texts are becoming more and more widespread sources information Markup languages such SGML Standard Generalized Markup Language Goldfarb Charles have been introduced for creating structured documents but extracting the information based the structures the documents still not very simple issue and most cases hoc and based primitive word searches This talk would introduce structured documents and SGML and discuss some the ways extracting information out tagged documents particular some present directions toward this area would discussed along with examples advantages and disadvantages Lincoln Carr Querying SGML Documents The Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML and the data type definitions DTDs built from provide the basis for storing documents way that allows complex querying The Text Encoding Initiative TEI uses SGML create standard DTDs for such document types poetry and drama TEI Currently TEI has encoded large body poetry using its standards into the English Poetry Database for which simple query engine available However since the poems are not marked using the fullest potential TEI standard many useful more complex types queries are not presently possible March Logic Seminar March Bob Penrod The Evolution Visualization Tools for Large Information Spaces Large information spaces present several problems for visualization Such spaces require tools that visualize all the necessary data and facilitate comprehension global structure Most traditional tools provide simple window that displays limited extent data This problematic because not all the data concurrently visible navigation through the data slow and attempt providing context made The Perspective Wall Mackinlay Robertson Card attempts handle these problems integrating detail and context will examine two precursors the Perspective Wall generalized fisheye views Furnas and the bifocal display Spence Apperley focusing particular the application those ideas linear information spaces Weizhen Interactive Video Technology Ordinary video applications only allow users access and replay movies passively Interactive Video technology introduced Yoshinobu Tonomura allows users more operations about the video such grasping the main idea the video fast browsing searching analyzing and editing Three topics are talked about here video segmentation and feature extraction Fast Browing method new video interfaces March Torrin Sanders Hypermedia Product Evaluation Xingchun Zheng Intelligent Multimedia System Hypermedia provides poeple with new way combine different media into single artefacts These can developed and marketed the style conventional media publications Multimedia technologies not only being the presentation data stored images sound and video but also allow the incorporation media specific input modes natural language speech pen gesture and the generation images sound and video from more abstract formats Using Intelligent Agent Mediate Multibase Information Access Behrendt Hutchinson Jeffrey Macnee Wilson the MIPS Project multimedia presentation system introduced the paper presentation open pre authored hypermedia network stored the HyTime standard format with dynamically created web nodes containing answers conventional database queries This illustrates how conventional hypermedia tools can extended include intelligent automatic generation multimedia presentations from retrieved data example multimodel system MMI described illustrate the technologies which could brought the market independently The above concepts and ideas are still the research stage March Qizhen Zhang Video Demand and Database Related Issues Introduction Video demand features new form information delivery that causing great commotion the industries cable telecommunications personal computers and software this revolution multimedia database design and management play indispesable role This talk briefly describes the architecture the technology and the experimental implementations this emerging application means the description potential database issues are explored example going discuss Network Support for Dynamically Scaled Multimedia Data Streams some depth Robert Fahey Video Object Servers and Video Demand Recently video demand has received quite bit attention the media However the media rarely discuss how will implemented this talk shall examine the requirements needed support real time video and how current technology meets these requirements will also describe several approaches providing demand video Some issues which will investigated are throughput requirements for video throughput and seektime for several secondary storage devices optimization organization techniques improve throughput response time and several types architectures support video objects This presentation based five different papers ranging from continuous media storage the cost effectiveness Video Demand systems These papers are Lougher and Shepherd Rangan and Vin Federighi and Rowe Ghandeharizadeh and Ramos and Doganata and Tantawi March Kaushik Mody Introduction ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode Computer networks have revolutionized the way communicate and interact the data around the world However with Distributed Multimedia becoming norms rather than exception the existing networks are not able support the high bandwidth and low latency requirements its applications Asynchronous Transfer Mode switching and multiplexing technique described technology that will allow total flexibility and efficiency achieved tomorrow high speed multi service multimedia networks This presentation based the work Ronald Vetter David and Kim and Wang Alan Keahey Multi Resolution Information Display This talk will take look some techniques for displaying information more than one level resolution simulataneously While similar scope the recent talk given Bob Penrod the focus will more the details hyperbolic fisheye views implementation issues and possibilities for future systems such multi focus systems March Yong Jiang Matadata Video Databases Video
