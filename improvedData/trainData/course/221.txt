programming While prior knowledge computers required the course challenging one and demands self discipline and hard work each student Although Computer Science not new course has been offered for many years the content has undergone extensive revision during the past years This revision response new approach computer programming known Object Oriented Programming Object Oriented Programming fast becoming the accepted methodology for the design and development today large and complex software systems and products Because there are not yet text books which emphasize Object Oriented Programming first computer science course have written our own text First Course Object Oriented Programming sense our new approach experimental Many computer science teachers are skeptical about are cautiously optimistic that are developing approach and associated materials that will prove effective providing foundation for object oriented program design and development throughout the Computer Science curriculum are sure discover things will want change gain experience with our new approach are anxious receive constructive feed back from students concerning the text the programming assignments the examples the order and selection topics any aspect the class Many students enrolling this course have done little lot programming Pascal some other programming language However unlikely that many students have had experience with Object Oriented programming you have had little experience with computers and programming you may feel yourself disadvantage compared others who have had programming experience Some students this situation well and experience little difficulty while others experience significant difficulty and frustration Even some students with programming experience may struggle will try very hard pace the course for beginners and will not let experienced programmers divert our lectures discussions toward advanced obscure topics you are having trouble understanding the lectures the reading the programming assignments then seek help early and often TAs the lab can help you your instructor can help you and you can attend Help section Help sections for are scheduled each semester Times and locations are posted the lab Plan attend least one help section each week teaching assistant who knows Pascal well will help with design and development the coming assignment and answer any questions you have LecturesThe purpose class lectures lend structure the class and tie the concepts together Instructors will also answer questions and elaborate concepts However you have primary responsibility for your education Other learning resources include weekly help sessions given lab the textbook and the computers with the Borland Pascal programming environment the lab Much your learning will take place the computer lab TextsIn addition this syllabus you will need buy the text First Course Object Oriented Programming Theodore Norman This text not yet published commercially but available packet the bookstore GradingPoints will assigned for each program and exam with programming assignments accounting for the grade and examinations Exams including the final exam will each count the final grade Final grading will then awarded straight percentage basis according the following scale EXAM SCHEDULE Fall EXAM TESTING CENTER EXAM TESTING

ORIENTATION Lab orientations will held the lab each hour the hour from through Wednesday Thursday and Friday You must attend one these orientation sessions that you will know how the computers work what the lab procedures are and how complete the first lab assignment EQUIPMENT The lab currently has several dozen IBM compatible linked together file server disk system using Novell networking equipment and software DISKETTES You will need least one double sided double density floppy diskette which save your programs Buy one the Bookstore better still buy two one for backup copy You should bring them with you Orientation but not critical you don have them yet You will however need them before you any assignments POLICIES Lab policies change somewhat from semester semester You can obtain current copy lab policies from any lab assistant However the following rules are always force and you will asked leave you break any them accessing copying displaying pornographic material food drink allowed Don unplug cables remove computer covers you are having problems get help from lab assistant games are allowed the computers any time word processing Lab assistants give first priority students with assignments checked off you have program ready signed off hold your Syllabus signal that you are ready illegal copying software HELP Help sections for are scheduled each semester Times and locations are posted the lab Plan attend least one help section each week teaching assistant who knows Pascal well will help with design and development the coming assignment and answer any questions you have These sessions are very important they will help you gain problem solving skills and understand how write the assigned programs the lab the lab assistants will only check off assignments answer brief questions about program syntax and help you using the computers will not write your programs for you nor debug your program logic The whole point the lab assignments for you learn how these tasks COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONSBelow are questions that are repeatedly asked about you don see the answer your question here review the previous pages talk your instructor lab assistant THERE WAY OBTAIN EXTRA CREDIT you have time extra credit work you have time assignment correctly OKAY STUDY WITH SOMEONE ELSE Yes group study very helpful for some However don let someone else write your programs for you you will unable pass the tests WHO MAKES THE EXAMS INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS THAT Standard exams are used for all sections The exams closely parallel the programming assignments and text chapter exercises WHAT HAPPENS PROGRAM ONLY PARTIALLY FINISHED AND THE LAB CLOSES HAVE LEAVE LOSE You won lose you save out your floppy disk You can then work some more next time you the lab good idea save your program periodically you work even you not going leave the lab Some programming errors can cause your work station hang that you must power off and get working again When this happens you lose everything you did since you last did save The Borland Pascal IDE provides for automatic periodic saving the program you are editing take advantage this feature check the Auto Save Editor Files box the Preferences dialog under the Environment option the Options menu WHAT DON HAVE THE PROGRAM FINISHED THE TIME DUE You have ten late days you may use without penalty Those days could all used for one assignment one day for each ten assignments other combinations After the late days are used you will lose point for each day subsequent assignments are late EVER ALLOWED PLAY COMPUTER GAMES Never Absolutely not Not even you the only person the lab CAN PLAY AROUND THE MACHINE JUST SEE HOW USE Yes all means Try entering and running the example programs your text modifying your programming assignments once you passed them off WHAT ALREADY HAVE DISKETTE you have inch disk fine you are using someone else disk make absolutely sure that she finished with and that the disk formatted for DOS later you buying your own disk should double sided double density floppy disk any case you still need purchase two Computer Science Materials Cards for the lab WHAT HAVE OWN COMPUTER The lab currently using Microsoft Windows and Borland Pascal with Objects IBM compatible PCs you want use your own computer you should have IBM compatible Compaq etc and your own copies Microsoft Windows and Borland Pascal with Objects You will also need get copy the and Turtles units from one the lab TAs You must still bring your programs into the lab pass off WHAT HAVE NON IBM COMPATIBLE COMPUTER you have Pascal compiler you can use learn some things about Pascal But won have Windows the and Turtles units you won able write the programming assignments WHAT THE BEST WAY SCHEDULE TIME THE LAB ALL SINGLE BLOCK SEPARATE HOURS Most people best lab hours are spread out through the week some people get tight they sit very long terminal recommend that you design and write your programs paper before going into the lab enter and debug them WILL CLASSES HELD THE WEEK EXAMS Yes always And sure not miss your exams plan take the exams the times scheduled Only rare cases will make tests given WHAT CAN NEED MORE HELP Three things Help sections schedule posted the lab See your instructor during his her office hours Individual assistance may arranged Hire tutor the Tutoring Service run the Student Academics office and free lance tutors often advertise bulletin boards and the Daily Universe CAN SHARE DISK WITH SOMEONE Not recommended You need your own disks THE HELP SECTIONS REALLY HELP Yes They are very useful helping students understand how complete Lab assignments Students who attend usually are very positive their evaluation the help sections One interesting observation failing students are almost never regular attendees the help sections HOW CAN GET THE MOST OUT THIS CLASS FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE LARGE CLASSES There reason wary large classes Studies show that unless the class very small less than dozen students the size the class has correlation the amount learning that takes place Much your learning will take place the lab anyway The best way learn Pascal any other programming language write many programs you can Assignment Check Off Sheet Fall Created Aug Updated Mon Apr Scott McCosh Send comments webmaster www byu edu
