Office Hours MWF appointment Linus Kwong Goals This class will examine high bit rate networks and their applications will focusing fiber optic Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM networks and the protocols which enable their use for telephony and lan traffic large part the grade the class will based lab projects associated with building protocol stack top ATM will also attempt predict usage models for networks the year and analyze technology for this new era networked computing Text David McDysan ATM Theory and Application augmented papers given out during the semester Prerequisites Unix network programming experience Newsgroup The newsgroup byu class contains questions and answers many common questions The would like have you post questions there first Grade breakdown Homework Labs Lab Socket Switch Lab Cells Lab Signalling Lab Congestion Lab APIs Lab NIST Simulator Project Midterm Final You can get CID Number and check your scores online Grading Late Policy All labs must fully functional order get any credit Late labs will have the points deducted plus for each week they are overdue lab that days late will receive credit days credit days credit Since the labs build each other your advantage turn them time Projects The last four weeks class will spent moderate sized research project You may work groups seperately the class project Expectations expect you become conversant with the basics ATM research This research area should motivate you independent reading and thinking You will spend least hours per week laboratory work reading You will need check the mosaic page http nebo byu edu clement html often order get changes assignments and updates the schedule All laboratory work and homework should done independently You may work group understand the material and questions but everything you turn pass off should your work Take steps protect your work from being copied read protecting your directory Class Adminstration Homework Questions Schedule Laboratories Sample Exams Projects Available documents The following papers are included background material the topics will discuss the class multimedia data bases The self similar nature ethernet traffic This page describes many the issues involved video transmission over and ATM networks Gunnar Karlsson Research Report http www sics libindex html from SICS Sweden Video Demand Architectures from ftp athos rutgers edu pub technical reports dcs Proposed Flow Specification RFC for ATM networks Introductory ATM Paper describing over ATM The focus this paper running over ATM but there extensive tutorial ATM John David Cavanaugh and Timothy Salo Internetworking with ATM WANs This page was created Robert Walthall and containes good summary the state research into Flow Control ATM networks This description non blocking should helpful the labs Sample CCITT specification Additional specifications can found through anonymous ftp src doc the computing ccitt ccitt standards ccitt directories good source ATM references Sample socket code available through anonymous ftp from timp byu edu the pub sockets directory available here shar file Information UNIX The Computer For The Century Scientific American Paper ATM FAQ The ATM Blue Book has extensive information about protocols standards and products used with ATM Parallel Computing ATM Networks Huang and McKinley Communication Issues Parallel Computing across ATM Networks IEEE Parallel and Distributed Technology accepted appear Pipelined Multi Processor Architecture for Connectionless Server for Broadband ISDN masters thesis Daniel Omundsen think the thesis good prototype for research this field and has fairly good bibliography and intro ATM Performance Analysis parallel library interfaces ATM Networks Mengjou Lin and Jenwei Hsieh and David and Joseph Thomas Distributed Network Computing over Local ATM Networks appear IEEE Journal Selected Areas Communications Special Issue ATM LANs Implementations and Experiences with Emerging Technology early There also information the ATM Testbed and NERO setup and heavy weights the ATM industry Also the ATM with PVM paper and ATM communication results and ATM pointers new paper PVM ATM networks Faster ATM Message Passing PVM also available The BATMAN Boulder West ATM trial described here paper ATM Switch Architectures also available MPEG background
