book better entitled Semantics Programming Languages The goal this course not conduct broad survey tech programming languages like Java SML nor directly study implementation mechanisms for these languages compressed dispatch tables for multiple inheritance Rather the goal this course study the principles formal notation for describing computations and tools for analyzing and proving properties computations These concerns subsume the study specific programming languages implementation mechanisms and hence lead deeper understanding programming specification logic mathematics and proof theory For example will study notations for abstractly specifying how programs compute operational semantics well notations for describing what programs compute denotational semantics turn the abstract but precise realization these notations will allow study techniques induction logical relations for formally proving interesting and relevant properties programming languages type safety compiler correctness Ideally student coming out this course will have learned something about how make informal concepts and notation precise and how manipulate the notation demonstrate useful properties Textbooks Semantics Programming Languages Carl Gunter for the Working Programmer Second Edition Larry Paulson Prerequisites the programming side assume experience with least Pascal like language Preferably students will have some knowledge and experience working with functional language such Scheme Haskell the theoretical side assume basic proficiency undergraduate mathematics logic and computer science basic knowledge computability turing machines recursive functions and logic predicate calculus well some mathematical maturity required This course designed for PhD students Math and not for MEng undergraduate students you are MEng undergraduate student you must talk the instructor find out the course suitable for you Contact Information Newsgroup cornell class Instructor Greg

topics systems nonmonotonic reasoning emphasizing circumscription applications formalizing common sense knowledge and reasoning situation calculus and its variants formalizing context and formalizing facts about knowledge will assign homeworks throughout the quarter and possibly short paper the end There will final any other tests All the assignments updates and other relevant information will
