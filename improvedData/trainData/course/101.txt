gradebook will updated regularly Programming Projects This the most important component the course There will programming assigment due almost every week Thursday Friday Later the course you will able notice that these are structured into two streams and solving early problem the stream necessary easy solutions the later ones not fall behind You will submit your source code electronically using the handin program This handin program does not compile run debug test your code that your job merely saves your file convenient location your can grade later All programs must run under cxx recommended that you use the UCS machine named zinc Programs will judged correctness completeness efficiency generality and aesthetics Programs that not compile will earn zero points Program descriptions will appear below they are assigned general solutions the programming projects will not supplied Programs are due according the system clock the specified date default that there grace period following
