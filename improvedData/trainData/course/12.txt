interact has led the creation numerous tools for formal reasoning will examine some systems for formal reasoning while examining number mechanical formal methods tools that support these different systems Examples such system tool pairs are System Tool Primitive Recursive Arithmetic Boyer Moore Prover ACL First Order Logic Otter Nelson qed Higher Order Logic HOL IMPS Equational Reasoning OBJ

students associated with the course The usernames associated with ACF logins are given login names txt Khoros intend making use the Khoros image processing system Initially want use the DIP Digital Image Processing course This available only under Khoros although later the course want make use Khoros First you need set your account access Khoros Instructions for doing this are found khoros instructions txt order use Khoros use netscape for that matter you need set your server Use the instructions instructions txt that DIP Course You should able learn lot about image processing and computer vision from the online DIP course run follow the instructions dip instructions txt Midterm Projects midterm all students are expected implement simple Khoros workspace perform simple image

Advanced Operating Systems Spring Summary This course intended give you broad exposure advanced operating systems topics There are two important components this course reading and discussion various research papers and project involving implementation experimental system The research papers cover topics including synchronization and communications memory management file systems protection and security and distributed systems The project requires you choose problem research and propose solutions and implement prototype system Lecture Info During each class will discuss topics relevant the current papers The lecture will not detailed review the papers but rather discussion major topics and themes using the papers focal point Active participation discussion strongly encouraged Lecture Tuesday and Thursday Engineering HallOffice Hour Tuesday appointment Computer Sciences Text Our text selection classic papers from the the operating system design and implementation You can purchase these readings the DoIT formerly MACC documentation desk for about The readings this semester are different from those previous semesters please buy copy these papers Grading There exam this course Instead there are two assignments The first assignment using benchmark suite measure the performance various operating systems SunOS Solaris Linux Windows etc many you can lay your hands The second assignment the project involving project proposal implementation final report and project presentation the total grade class participation counts the first assignment counts and the project counts Schedule Here tentative schedule Projects Here list suggested projects You can make your own project well either case you need come and discuss with before choosing project Teams two more people are allowed Slides Here are the slides used lectures Assigments Here the first assignment
