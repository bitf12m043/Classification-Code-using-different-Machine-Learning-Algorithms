edu classes cis Computer architecture the science and art selecting and interconnecting hardware components create computer that meets functional performance and cost goals This course qualitatively and quantitatively examines computer design tradeoffs Our focus will processor architectures memory systems and multiprocessor machines particular will study instruction level parallelism super pipelining and super scalar aRISC processor design memory hierarchies cache systems and coherency mechanisms and multiprocessor architectures and parallel computing Announcements Instructor Lecture

the bookstore Lecture Notes Lecture notes will made available they are developed See links schedule Homework There will two homework assignments Many problems will require the review material that touched upon but not covered depth class Assignments will due class the due date LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL ACCEPTED except under extreme non academic circumstances discussed with the instructor least one week before the assignment due Homework Figure and Figure Errata Solutions Homework This has been combined with the programming assignment Examinations Midterm Takehome Oct Halloween Due Nov Please advise any conflicts with these likely exam times before the end the second week classes Programming The topic the programming assignment cache simulation The programming assigment combined with the second homework assignment There are two parts Part Run the following trace files through the Dinero cache simulator Use the Dinero server found this WEB page found Dinero server options spice found Dinero server options tex found Dinero server options Show results for different levels cache size unified and split associativity and block sizes Explain the results that you see Part The following sample code models Kbyte direct mapped cache with byte lines blocks treats reads and writes the samewas simple reference Included only the routine that checks for reference the cache and accummulates total references and misses Not included are the routines read reference trace assuming comes from file stdio and produce output statistics include include define CACHE SIZE define BLOCK SHIFT long tags CACHE SIZE BLOCK SHIFT long references misses void Reference long address int index address CACHE SIZE BLOCK SHIFT long tag address BLOCK SHIFT tags index tag misses tags index tag references Add necessary support briefly described the code above make this into cache simulation program that takes reference trace file Write routine model way and way set associative cache the same size Demonstrate the operation all three simulators with three programs your own choosing That find write three programs they can simple from which you can capture address references drive your simulators One thought get three Linpack codes Note you need modify the programs capture references concentrate only data references This assignment will due Dec Term Project The term project will write paper that surveys area within computer architecture The paper should summarize work area giving extensive references least present opinions others for against various options again with references conclude with your opinion the strengths and weaknesses the arguments given You will graded the completeness your survey the accuracy your summaries and the support you give for your opinions Some possible survey topics are compiler transformations improve memory behavior superscalar superpipelined processors VLIW effect architecture changing technology you might consider different types technology high performance for storage network communication contrast state the art processors massively parallel processing systems scalable architecture technologies some aspect the history computer architecture The topic chosen should something that you are particularly interested There are many references for papers including Proc the Int Symposium Computer Architecture ISCA Proc the Conf Architectural
