September Stanford University Computer Science Department part the School Engineering The department offers the degrees Bachelor Science Master Science and Doctor Philosophy also participates the following undergraduate inter disciplinary programs Computer Systems Engineering Symbolic Systems and Mathematical and Computational Sciences Founded the Department Computer Science center for research and education the undergraduate and graduate levels Strong research groups exist areas artificial intelligence robotics foundations computer science scientific computing and systems Basic work computer science the main research goal these groups but there also strong emphasis interdisciplinary research and applications that stimulate basic research Fields which interdisciplinary work has been undertaken include chemistry genetics linguistics physics medicine and various areas engineering construction and manufacturing Close ties are maintained with researchers with computational interests other university departments addition both faculty and students commonly work with investigators nearby research industrial institutions The main educational goal prepare students for research and teaching careers either universities industry Department InformationAddress information Computer Science Dept Gates Computer Science Building Stanford University Stanford USAPhone numbers
